[{"title":"Rush (gridiron football)","content":"Rushing is an action taken by the offense, usually the running back, but it can also be the quarterback, that means to advance the ball by running with it, as opposed to passing,[1] or kicking.[2]  Rushing, on offense, is running with the ball when starting from behind the line of scrimmage with an intent of gaining yardage.  While this usually means a running play, any offensive play that does not involve a forward pass is a rush - also called a run.  It is usually done by the running back after a handoff from the quarterback, although quarterbacks and wide receivers can also rush.  The quarterback will usually run when a passing play has broken down \u2013 such as when there is no receiver open to catch the ball \u2013 and there is room to run down the field.  A team with a quarterback who is fast and skilled at running may regularly call intentional running plays for that quarterback, but this is rare due to the increased risk of injury.  A wide receiver can act as a rusher on several kinds of plays, such as on a reverse, on an end-around, or on a lateral pass behind the line of scrimmage, which is a type of screen pass.  However, a wide receiver screen play is usually intended to be a forward pass so that if the receiver drops the ball it is an incomplete pass instead of a fumble.  A rushing attempt may also be referred to as a carry, with any yards gained referred to as rushing yards, as in \"the running back had 20 carries for 100 rushing yards.\" "},{"title":"American football field","content":"The rectangular field of play used for American football games measures 100 yards (91.44\u00a0m) long between the goal lines, and 160 feet (48.8\u00a0m) (53.3 yards) wide. The field may be made of grass or artificial turf. In addition, there are end zones extending another 10 yards (9.144\u00a0m) past the goal lines to the \"end lines\", for a total length of 120 yards (109.7\u00a0m). When the \"football field\" is used as unit of measurement, it is usually understood to mean 100 yards (91.44\u00a0m), although technically the full length of the official field, including the end zones, is 120 yards (109.7\u00a0m). The total area of the field is 57,600\u00a0sq\u00a0ft or 5,350\u00a0m2. There is a goal centered on each end line, with a crossbar 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) above the ground and goalposts 18\u00a0feet 6\u00a0inches (5.64\u00a0m) apart (in college and the NFL) extending at least 35 feet (11\u00a0m) above the crossbar. Between the goal lines, additional lines span the width of the field at 5-yard intervals. This appearance led to the use of the term gridiron in the 1880s. For a few years in the early 20th century, lines perpendicular to the lines at 5-yard intervals spanned the length of the field, giving it a checkerboard-like appearance.  This article mainly describes the field used in the National Football League, college football, and other leagues playing the standard form of outdoor 11-man football. Other variants of American football such as nine-man or arena football typically use smaller fields with smaller end zones.  The entire field is a rectangle 360 feet (110\u00a0m) long by 160 feet (49\u00a0m) wide; covering a total of 1.32 acres.[1] The longer lines are the sidelines and the shorter lines are called end lines. NFL rules call for the sidelines and end lines to be 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m) wide, though the lines may be narrower on fields used for multiple sports or by college or amateur teams. In all cases the sidelines and end lines are measured along the inside edges of the boundary lines, and the lines themselves are out of bounds. Most distances on a football field are expressed in terms of yards.  The goal lines span the width of the field and run 10 yards (9.1\u00a0m) parallel to each end line. The 100 yards between the goal lines where most gameplay occurs is officially called the field of play in the NFL rulebook. Additional lines span the width of the field at 5-yard intervals from each goal line.  The areas at each end of the field between the goal lines and end lines \u2013 including the goal lines themselves \u2013 are called the end zones. The end zones are where touchdowns, two-point conversions, and safeties are scored, and where touchbacks occur. Orange weighted pylons mark the four corners of each end zone. Team or league logos or other patterns may be painted inside the end zone as long as they do not interfere with the mandatory field markings.  A goal is centered on each end line, consisting of a horizontal crossbar 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) above the ground and aligned with the inside edge of the end line, with vertical goal posts (colloquially \"uprights\") at each end of the crossbar 18\u00a0feet 6\u00a0inches (5.64\u00a0m) apart and extending at least 35 feet (11\u00a0m) above the crossbar. The goals are where field goals (including rare fair catch kicks) and extra points after touchdowns are scored. All NFL fields and many collegiate and amateur fields have slingshot-shaped goal structures, with a single gooseneck-shaped support post anchored to the ground out of bounds. Other amateur fields, particularly at the high school level, may have H-shaped goal structures with two support posts anchored to the ground directly below the crossbar; on fields used for multiple sports these goals may double as soccer goals at the appropriate regulation width for that sport, along with the goal structure behind it and netting. The NFL requires a ribbon to be attached to the top of each goal post to indicate wind direction and speed. Goal posts must be yellow in the NFL unless waived due to extraordinary circumstances; collegiate fields may have yellow or white goal posts. Amateur fields may also have shorter goal posts or a wider space between the goal posts.[2][3][4] Since 1974, NFL rules has the goalposts positioned at the end line; prior to that season, they were on the goal line (they have at the end line collegiately since 1927).[5]  A yard line refers to the distance of some point on the 100-yard field of play \u2013 usually the line of scrimmage or the spot where a play ends \u2013 from the nearest goal line.[6] When moving away from one goal line, the yard line numbers increase from 1 to 50 (midfield), then decrease back to 1 approaching the opposite goal line. Each yard line is said to \"belong\" to the team defending the closer end zone; for example, during a period where Team A is defending the north end zone and Team B is defending the south end zone, the 25-yard line closer to the north end zone is said to be Team A's 25-yard line.  Yard lines are identified with two rows of white numbers painted inside each sideline at 10-yard intervals (with some venues such as Tiger Stadium also marking 5-yard intervals, and some such as Sanford Stadium marking the goal line as \"G\"); the numbers 10 through 40 also include an arrow indicating the nearer goal line. NFL rules call for the bottom edge of each number to be 12 yards from the sideline. The yard lines are also identified at 10-yard intervals by orange markers placed outside the sidelines adjacent to the respective line. Yard lines other than multiples of 5 are marked by 2-foot (0.61\u00a0m) long, 4-inch (0.10\u00a0m) wide lines painted parallel to the goal lines at 1-yard intervals spanning the length of the field just inside each sideline as well as at the hash marks (see below).  The hash marks (officially inbounds lines in the NFL rulebook) are two rows of short lines running the length of the field that mark the boundaries of where a scrimmage down may start. If the ball is downed outside the hash marks or run out of bounds, the next play begins at the hash mark closest to the spot where it is downed. In the NFL since 1972, the hash marks are 70\u00a0feet 9\u00a0inches (21.56\u00a0m) from each sideline; in college football they are 60 feet (18\u00a0m) from each sideline. At each 5-yard line they are marked with 2-foot (0.61\u00a0m) lines painted parallel to the sidelines. Between the 5-yard lines they are marked with 2-foot lines painted perpendicular to the sidelines at 1-yard intervals. The hash marks are painted so that the edge farthest from the sideline is the required distance from the sideline.  In the NFL and most forms of indoor football, the hash marks are in line with the goalposts. College and high school football fields have hash marks that are significantly wider than the goal posts. The college football standard, which was the previous standard in the NFL (from 1945 to 1971), is 40 feet apart (20 yards from the sidelines),[7] instituted in 1993.[8][9] Previously, the college width was the same as the high school standard, at one-third of the width of the field (531\u20443 feet).  In the NFL, a 3-foot (0.91\u00a0m) line is painted parallel to the goal line at the center of the 2-yard line; this denotes the line of scrimmage for a two-point conversion attempt (this was also the line of scrimmage for an extra point attempt prior to 2015); at the college level, this special hashmark is on the 3-yard line for an extra point attempt.  A small X may be painted at the center of each 35-yard line on NFL or college fields to indicate the spot where kickoffs take place.  Most professional and collegiate fields have a team or league logo painted at the 50-yard line. Special games such as the Super Bowl or college bowl games may have the event logo painted at the 50-yard line. These logos as well as any other non-mandatory field markings require league approval and may not interfere with mandatory field markings.  Decorative yard lines, either at the 25-yard or 20-yard line, are common, usually featuring either team colors or American flag colors, and the 20-yard version indicates the start of the red zone.  According to the high school rulebook recommendations, the field should be angled (or \"crowned\") at approximately 1.2\u00b0 (rising 1\u20444 inch per foot, or 1 in 48) upward from each sideline to the center of the field so that the center is 20 inches (51\u00a0cm) higher than the sidelines, allowing proper drainage.[10] "},{"title":"Swimming","content":"Swimming is the self-propulsion of a person through water, or other liquid, usually for recreation, sport, exercise, or survival. Locomotion is achieved through coordinated movement of the limbs and the body to achieve hydrodynamic thrust that results in directional motion. Humans can hold their breath underwater and undertake rudimentary locomotive swimming within weeks of birth, as a survival response. Swimming requires stamina, skills, and proper technique. [1]  Swimming is a popular recreational activity and competitive sport that involves moving through water using various techniques. It offers numerous health benefits, such as strengthened cardiovascular health, muscle strength, and increased flexibility. It is suitable for people of all ages and fitness levels.  Swimming is consistently among the top public recreational activities,[2][3][4][5] and in some countries, swimming lessons are a compulsory part of the educational curriculum.[6]  As a formalized sport, swimming is featured in various local, national, and international competitions, including every modern Summer Olympics.  Swimming involves repeated motions known as strokes to propel the body forward. While the front crawl, also known as freestyle, is widely regarded as the fastest of the four main strokes, other strokes are practiced for special purposes, such as training.  Swimming comes with certain risks, mainly because of the aquatic environment where it takes place. By way of example, swimmers may find themselves incapacitated by panic and exhaustion, both potential causes of death by drowning. Other dangers may arise from exposure to infection or hostile aquatic fauna. To minimize such eventualities, most facilities employ a lifeguard to keep alert for any signs of distress.  Swimmers often wear specialized swimwear, although depending on the area's culture, some swimmers may also swim nude or wear their day attire. In addition, a variety of equipment can be used to enhance the swimming experience or performance, including but not limited to the use of swimming goggles, floatation devices, swim fins, and snorkels.  Swimming relies on the nearly neutral buoyancy of the human body. On average, the body has a relative density of 0.98 compared to water, which causes the body to float. However, buoyancy varies based on body composition, lung inflation, muscle and fat content, centre of gravity and the salinity of the water. Higher levels of body fat and saltier water both lower the relative density of the body and increase its buoyancy. Because they tend to have a lower centre of gravity and higher muscle content, human males find it more difficult to float or be buoyant.  See also: Hydrostatic weighing.  Since the human body is less dense than water, water can support the body's weight during swimming. As a result, swimming is \"low-impact\" compared to land activities such as running. The density and viscosity of water also create resistance for objects moving through the water. Swimming strokes use this resistance to create propulsion, but this same resistance also generates drag on the body.  Hydrodynamics is important to stroke technique for swimming faster, and swimmers who want to swim faster or exhaust less try to reduce the drag of the body's motion through the water. To be more hydrodynamically effective, swimmers can either increase the power of their strokes or reduce water resistance. However, power must increase by a factor of three to achieve the same effect as reducing resistance.[7] Efficient swimming by reducing water resistance involves a horizontal water position, rolling the body to reduce the breadth of the body in the water, and extending the arms as far as possible to reduce wave resistance.[7]  Just before plunging into the pool, swimmers may perform exercises such as squatting. Squatting helps enhance a swimmer's start by warming up the thigh muscles.[8][clarification needed]  Human babies demonstrate an innate swimming or diving reflex from newborn until approximately ten months.[9] Other mammals also demonstrate this phenomenon (see mammalian diving reflex).  The diving response involves apnea, reflex bradycardia, and peripheral vasoconstriction; in other words, babies immersed in water spontaneously hold their breath, slow their heart rate, and reduce blood circulation to the extremities (fingers and toes).[9] Because infants are innately able to swim, classes for babies about six months old are offered in many locations. This helps build muscle memory and makes strong swimmers from a young age.  Swimming can be undertaken using a wide range of styles, known as 'strokes,' and which are used for different purposes or to distinguish between classes in competitive swimming. Using a defined stroke for propulsion through the water is unnecessary, and untrained swimmers may use a 'doggy paddle' of arm and leg movements, similar to how four-legged animals swim.  Four main strokes are used in competition and recreational swimming: the front crawl, freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke, and butterfly. Competitive swimming in Europe started around 1800, mostly using the breaststroke, which started as the current breaststroke arms and the legs of the butterfly stroke. In 1873, John Arthur Trudgen introduced the trudgen to Western swimming competitions.[10] The butterfly was developed in the 1930s and was considered a variant of the breaststroke until it was accepted as a separate style in 1953.[11] Butterfly is considered the hardest stroke by many people, but it is the most effective for all-around toning and the building of muscles.[12] It also burns the most calories and can be the second fastest stroke if practiced regularly.[12]  In non-competitive swimming, there are some swimming strokes, including sidestroke. The sidestroke, toward the end of the 19th century, changed this pattern by raising one arm above the water first, then the other, and then each in turn. It is still used in lifesaving and recreational swimming.  Other strokes exist for particular reasons, such as training, school lessons, and rescue, and it is often possible to change strokes to avoid using parts of the body, either to separate specific body parts, such as swimming with only arms or legs to exercise them harder, or for amputees or those affected by paralysis.  Swimming has been recorded since prehistoric times, and the earliest records of swimming date back to Stone Age paintings from around 7,000 years ago. Written references date from 2000 BCE.  Some earliest references include the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Iliad, the Odyssey, the Bible (Ezekiel 47:5, Acts 27:42, Isaiah 25:11), Beowulf, and other sagas.  In 450 BC, Herodotus described a failed seaborne expedition of Mardonius with the words \"\u2026those who could not swim perished from that cause, others from the cold\".[13]  The coastal tribes living in the volatile[clarification needed] Low Countries were known as excellent swimmers by the Romans. Men and horses of the Batavi tribe could cross the Rhine without losing formation, according to Tacitus. Dio Cassius describes one surprise tactic employed by Aulus Plautius against the Celts at the Battle of the Medway:[14]  The [British Celts] thought that Romans would not be able to cross it without a bridge, and consequently bivouacked in rather careless fashion on the opposite bank; but he sent across a detachment of [Batavii], who were accustomed to swim easily in full armour across the most turbulent streams. ... Thence the Britons retired to the river Thames at a point near where it empties into the ocean and at flood-tide forms a lake. This they easily crossed because they knew where the firm ground and the easy passages in this region were to be found, but the Romans in attempting to follow them were not so successful. However, the [Batavii] swam across again and some others got over by a bridge a little way up-stream, after which they assailed the barbarians from several sides at once and cut down many of them. In 1538, Nikolaus Wynmann, a Swiss\u2013German professor of languages, wrote the earliest known complete book about swimming, Colymbetes, sive de arte natandi dialogus et festivus et iucundus lectu (The Swimmer, or A Dialogue on the Art of Swimming and Joyful and Pleasant to Read).[15][13]  There are many reasons why people swim, from a recreational pursuit to swimming as a necessary part of a job or other activity. Swimming may also be used to rehabilitate injuries, especially various cardiovascular and muscle injuries. People may also pursue swimming as a career or field of interest. Some may be gifted and choose to compete professionally and go on to claim fame.  Many swimmers swim for recreation, with swimming consistently ranking as one of the physical activities people are most likely to participate in. Recreational swimming can also be used for exercise, relaxation, or rehabilitation.[16]  The support of the water and the reduction in impact make swimming accessible for people unable to undertake activities such as running. Swimming is one of the most relaxing activities, and water is known to calm us and help reduce stress.  Swimming is primarily a cardiovascular\/aerobic exercise[17] due to the long exercise time, requiring a constant oxygen supply, except for short sprints where the muscles work anaerobically. Furthermore, swimming can help tone and strengthen muscles.[18] Regular swimming can help in weight management and contribute to maintaining a healthy body weight. (Robinson 2022) Swimming allows sufferers of arthritis to exercise affected joints without worsening their symptoms. Swimming is often recommended for individuals with joint conditions or injuries, as the buoyancy of water reduces stress on the joints. However, swimmers with arthritis may wish to avoid swimming breaststroke, as improper technique can exacerbate arthritic knee pain.[19] As with most aerobic exercise, swimming reduces the harmful effects of stress. Swimming also improves health for people with cardiovascular problems and chronic illnesses. It is proven to impact the mental health of pregnant women and mothers positively. Swimming can even improve mood.[20] Although many forms of physical activity have been shown to improve bone density and health, this is where swimming has its downfalls. Due to the low-impact nature of the sport, studies have demonstrated that bone mass acquisition will be negatively impacted, which could be an issue for adolescent athletes in particular.[21]  Since 2010, the Americans with Disabilities Act has required that swimming pools in the United States be accessible to disabled swimmers.[22]  \"Water-based exercise can benefit older adults by improving quality of life and decreasing disability. It also improves or maintains the bone health of post-menopausal women.\"[23] Swimming is an ideal workout for the elderly, as it is a low-impact sport with very little risk of injury. Exercise in the water works out all muscle groups, helping with conditions such as muscular dystrophy which is common in seniors. It is also a common way to relieve pain from arthritis.  Swimming as a sport predominantly involves participants competing to be the fastest over a given distance in a certain period of time.  Competitors swim different distances in different levels of competition. For example, swimming has been an Olympic sport since 1896, and the current program includes events from 50 m to 1500 m in length, across all four main strokes and medley.  During the season competitive swimmers typically train multiple times per day and week to increase endurance, strength, and preserve fitness. Furthermore when the cycle of work is completed swimmers go through a stage called taper where intensity is reduced in preparation for competition season. During taper, focus is on power and water feel.  The sport is governed internationally by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Natation (FINA), and competition pools for FINA events are 25 or 50 meters in length. In the United States, a pool 25 yards in length is commonly used for competition.  Other swimming and water-related sporting disciplines include open water swimming, diving, synchronized swimming, water polo, triathlon, and the modern pentathlon.  It is important to prioritize safety when swimming. This includes having lifeguards present, swimming in designated areas, and being aware of potential hazards such as currents and underwater obstacles.   As a popular leisure activity done all over the world, one of the primary risks of swimming is drowning. Drowning may occur from a variety of factors, from swimming fatigue to simply inexperience in the water. From 2005 to 2014, an average of 3,536 fatal unintentional drownings occurred in the United States, approximating 10 deaths a day.[24]  To minimize the risk and prevent potential drownings from occurring, lifeguards are often employed to supervise swimming locations such as pools, waterparks, lakes and beaches. Different lifeguards receive different training depending on the sites that they are employed at; i.e. a waterfront lifeguard receives more rigorous training than a poolside lifeguard. Well-known aquatic training services include the National Lifesaving Society and the Canadian Red Cross, which specialize in training lifeguards in North America.   Learning basic water safety skills, such as swimming with a buddy and knowing how to respond to emergencies, is essential for swimmers of all levels.  Some occupations require workers to swim, such as abalone and pearl diving, and spearfishing.  Swimming is used to rescue people in the water who are in distress, including exhausted swimmers, non-swimmers who have accidentally entered the water, and others who have come to harm on the water. Lifeguards or volunteer lifesavers are deployed at many pools and beaches worldwide to fulfil this purpose, and they, as well as rescue swimmers, may use specific swimming styles for rescue purposes.  Swimming is also used in marine biology to observe plants and animals in their natural habitat. Other sciences use swimming; for example, Konrad Lorenz swam with geese as part of his studies of animal behavior.  Swimming also has military purposes. Military swimming is usually done by special operation forces, such as Navy SEALs and US Army Special Forces. Swimming is used to approach a location, gather intelligence, engage in sabotage or combat, and subsequently depart. This may also include airborne insertion into water or exiting a submarine while it is submerged. Due to regular exposure to large bodies of water, all recruits in the United States Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard are required to complete basic swimming or water survival training.  Swimming is also a professional sport. Companies sponsor swimmers who have the skills to compete at the international level. Many swimmers compete competitively to represent their home countries in the Olympics. Professional swimmers may also earn a living as entertainers, performing in water ballets.  Locomotion by swimming over brief distances is frequent when alternatives are precluded. There have been cases of political refugees swimming in the Baltic Sea[25] and of people jumping in the water and swimming ashore from vessels not intended to reach land where they planned to go.[26]  There are many risks associated with voluntary or involuntary human presence in water, which may result in death directly or through drowning asphyxiation. Swimming is both the goal of much voluntary presence and the prime means of regaining land in accidental situations.  Most recorded water deaths fall into these categories:  Adverse effects of swimming can include:  Around any pool area, safety equipment is often important, and is a zoning requirement for most residential pools in the United States.[28] Supervision by personnel trained in rescue techniques is required at most competitive swimming meets and public pools.  Traditionally, children were considered not able to swim independently until 4 years of age,[29] although now infant swimming lessons are recommended to prevent drowning.[30]  In Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Estonia and Finland, the curriculum for the fifth grade (fourth grade in Estonia) states that all children should learn to swim as well as how to handle emergencies near water. Most commonly, children are expected to be able to swim 200 metres (660\u00a0ft)\u2014of which at least 50 metres (160\u00a0ft) on their back \u2013 after first falling into deep water and getting their head under water. Even though about 95 percent of Swedish school children know how to swim, drowning remains the third most common cause of death among children.[citation needed]  In both the Netherlands and Belgium swimming lessons under school time (schoolzwemmen, school swimming) are supported by the government. Most schools provide swimming lessons. There is a long tradition of swimming lessons in the Netherlands and Belgium, the Dutch translation for the breaststroke swimming style is even schoolslag (schoolstroke). In France, swimming is a compulsory part of the curriculum for primary schools. Children usually spend one semester per year learning swimming during CP\/CE1\/CE2\/CM1 (1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th grade).  In many places, swimming lessons are provided by local swimming pools, both those run by the local authority and by private leisure companies. Many schools also include swimming lessons into their Physical Education curricula, provided either in the schools' own pool or in the nearest public pool.  In the UK, the \"Top-ups scheme\" calls for school children who cannot swim by the age of 11 to receive intensive daily lessons. Children who have not reached Great Britain's National Curriculum standard of swimming 25 meters by the time they leave primary school receive a half-hour lesson every day for two weeks during term-time.[31]  In Canada and Mexico there has been a call to include swimming in public school curriculum.[32]  In the United States there is the Infant Swimming Resource (ISR)[33] initiative that provides lessons for infant children, to cope with an emergency where they have fallen into the water. They are taught how to roll-back-to-float (hold their breath underwater, to roll onto their back, to float unassisted, rest and breathe until help arrives), while clothed and unclothed. In ISR they teach the children how to roll with their clothes on, as a simulation, if they were to actually fall in walking or crawling by.  In Switzerland, swimming lessons for babies are popular, to help them getting used to be in another element. At the competition level, unlike in other countries - such as the Commonwealth countries, swimming teams are not related to educational institutions (high-schools and universities), but rather to cities or regions.  Standard everyday clothing is usually impractical for swimming and is unsafe under some circumstances. Most cultures today expect swimmers to wear swimsuits.  Men's swimsuits commonly resemble shorts, or briefs. Men's casual swimsuits (for example, boardshorts) are rarely skintight, unlike competitive swimwear, like jammers or diveskins. In most cases, boys and men swim with their upper body exposed, except in countries where custom or law prohibits it in a public setting, or for practical reasons such as sun protection.  Modern women's swimsuits are generally skintight, covering the pubic region and the breasts (See bikini). Women's swimwear may also cover the midriff as well. Women's swimwear is often a fashion statement, and whether it is modest or not is a subject of debate by many groups, religious and secular.  Competitive swimwear is built so that the wearer can swim faster and more efficiently. Modern competitive swimwear is skintight and lightweight. There are many kinds of competitive swimwear for each gender. It is used in aquatic competitions, such as water polo, swim racing, diving, and rowing.  Wetsuits provide both thermal insulation and flotation. Many swimmers lack buoyancy in the leg. The wetsuit provides additional volume at a lower density and therefore improves buoyancy and trim while swimming. It provides insulation between the skin and water which reduces heat loss. The wetsuit is the usual choice for those who swim in cold water for long periods of time, as it reduces susceptibility to hypothermia.  Some people also choose to wear no clothing while swimming. In some European countries public pools allow clothes-free swimming and many countries have beaches where one can swim naked. It is legal to swim naked in the sea at all UK beaches. It was common for males to swim naked in a public setting up to the early 20th century. Today, swimming naked can be a rebellious activity or merely a casual one. "},{"title":"FIFA","content":"  The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration internationale de football association (French for 'International Association Football Federation';[3] abbreviated as FIFA and pronounced in English as \/\u02c8fi\u02d0f\u0259\/ FEE-f\u0259) is an international self-regulatory governing body of association football, beach soccer, and futsal. It was founded in 1904[4] to oversee international competition among the national associations of Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain (represented by the Madrid Football Club), Sweden, and Switzerland. Headquartered in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, its membership now comprises 211 national associations. These national associations must also be members of one of the six regional confederations into which the world is divided: CAF (Africa), AFC (Asia and Australia), UEFA (Europe), CONCACAF (North & Central America and the Caribbean), OFC (Oceania), and CONMEBOL (South America).  FIFA outlines several objectives in its organizational statutes, including growing association football internationally, providing efforts to ensure it is accessible to everyone, and advocating for integrity and fair play.[5] It is responsible for the organization and promotion of association football's major international tournaments, notably the World Cup which commenced in 1930, and the Women's World Cup which began in 1991. Although FIFA does not solely set the laws of the game, that being the responsibility of the International Football Association Board of which FIFA is a member, it applies and enforces the rules across all FIFA competitions.[6] All FIFA tournaments generate revenue from sponsorships; in 2022, FIFA had revenues of over US $5.8\u00a0billion, ending the 2019\u20132022 cycle with a net positive of US$1.2\u00a0billion, and cash reserves of over US$3.9\u00a0billion.[7]  Reports by investigative journalists have linked FIFA leadership with corruption, bribery, and vote-rigging related to the election of FIFA president Sepp Blatter and the organization's decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar, respectively. These allegations led to the indictments of nine high-ranking FIFA officials and five corporate executives by the U.S. Department of Justice on charges including racketeering, wire fraud, and money laundering. On 27 May 2015, several of these officials were arrested by Swiss authorities, who launched a simultaneous but separate criminal investigation into how the organization awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Those among these officials who were also indicted in the U.S. are expected to be extradited to face charges there as well.[8][9][10]  Many officials were suspended by FIFA's ethics committee including Sepp Blatter[11] and Michel Platini.[12] In early 2017, reports became public about FIFA president Gianni Infantino attempting to prevent the re-elections[13] of both chairmen of the ethics committee, Cornel Borb\u00e9ly and Hans-Joachim Eckert, during the FIFA congress in May 2017.[14][15] On 9 May 2017, following Infantino's proposal,[16] FIFA Council decided not to renew the mandates of Borb\u00e9ly and Eckert.[16] Together with the chairmen, 11 of 13 committee members were removed. FIFA has been suspected of corruption regarding the Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup.[17]  The need for a single body to oversee association football became increasingly apparent at the beginning of the 20th century with the increasing popularity of international fixtures. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was founded in the rear of the headquarters of the Union des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Fran\u00e7aises de Sports Athl\u00e9tiques (USFSA) at the Rue Saint Honor\u00e9 229 in Paris on 21 May 1904.[18] The French name and acronym are universally adopted outside French-speaking countries. The founding members were the national associations of Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Spain (represented by then-Real Madrid CF; the Royal Spanish Football Federation was not created until 1913), Sweden and Switzerland.  On the same day, the German Football Association (DFB) declared its intention to affiliate through a telegram.[1]  The first president of FIFA was Robert Gu\u00e9rin. Gu\u00e9rin was replaced in 1906 by Daniel Burley Woolfall from England, by then a member of the association. The first tournament FIFA staged, the association football competition for the 1908 Olympics in London was more successful than its Olympic predecessors, despite the presence of professional footballers, contrary to the founding principles of FIFA.[19][20][21][22]  Membership of FIFA expanded beyond Europe with the application of South Africa in 1909, Argentina in 1912, Canada and Chile in 1913, and the United States in 1914.[23]  The 1912 Spalding Athletic Library \"Official Guide\" includes information on the 1912 Olympics (scores and stories), AAFA, and FIFA. The 1912 FIFA President was Dan B Woolfall.[24] Daniel Burley Woolfall was president from 1906 to 1918.[25]  During World War I, with many players sent off to war and the possibility of travel for international fixtures severely limited, the organization's survival was in doubt. Post-war, following the death of Woolfall, the organization was run by Dutchman Carl Hirschmann. It was saved from extinction but at the cost of the withdrawal of the Home Nations (of the United Kingdom), who cited an unwillingness to participate in international competitions with their World War enemies. The Home Nations later resumed their membership. The FIFA collection is held by the National Football Museum at Urbis in Manchester, England.[26] The first World Cup was held in 1930 in Montevideo, Uruguay.[26]  The FIFA flag is blue, with the organization's wordmark logo in the middle. The current FIFA flag was first flown during the 2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony in Moscow, Russia.[27]  Akin to the UEFA Champions League, FIFA has adopted an anthem composed by the German composer Franz Lambert since the 1994 FIFA World Cup. It has been re-arranged and produced by Rob May and Simon Hill.[28][29] The FIFA Anthem is played at the beginning of official FIFA sanctioned matches and tournaments such as international friendlies, the FIFA World Cup, FIFA Women's World Cup, FIFA U-20 World Cup, FIFA U-17 World Cup, Football at the Summer Olympics, FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup, FIFA Women's U-17 World Cup, FIFA Futsal World Cup, FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup and FIFA Club World Cup.[30]  Since 2007, FIFA has also required most of its broadcast partners to use short sequences including the anthem at the beginning and end of FIFA event coverage and for break bumpers to help promote FIFA's sponsors. This emulates practices long used by international football events, such as the UEFA Champions League. Exceptions may be made for specific circumstances; for example, an original piece of African music was used for bumpers during the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[31]    Besides its worldwide institutions, there are six confederations recognized by FIFA which oversee the game in the different continents and regions of the world. National associations, and not the continental confederations, are members of FIFA. The continental confederations are provided for in FIFA's statutes, and membership of a union is a prerequisite to FIFA membership.  In total, FIFA recognizes 211 national associations and their associated men's national teams as well as 129 women's national teams; see the list of national football teams and their respective country codes. The number of FIFA member associations is higher than the number of UN member states as FIFA has admitted associations from 23 non-sovereign entities as members in their own right, such as the four Home Nations within the United Kingdom and the two special administrative regions of China: Hong Kong and Macau.  On 28 February 2022, FIFA suspended Russia from all competitions due to controversy surrounding Russia's invasion of Ukraine.[32]  FIFA can suspend countries due to numerous multifaceted issues. Common reasons include governance interference, corruption, and financial irregularities. Doping or the misappropriation of drugs is also a consideration for expulsion.  The FIFA Men's World Rankings are updated monthly and rank each team based on their performance in international competitions, qualifiers, and friendly matches. There is also a world ranking for women's football, amended on a quarterly schedule.  FIFA's headquarters is in Z\u00fcrich, and it is an association established under the law of Switzerland.  FIFA's supreme body is the FIFA Congress, an assembly of representatives from each affiliated member association. Each national football association has one vote, regardless of size or footballing strength. The Congress assembles in ordinary sessions once every year, and extraordinary sessions have been held once a year since 1998. Congress makes decisions relating to FIFA's governing statutes and their method of implementation and application. Only Congress can pass changes to FIFA's statutes. The congress approves the annual report and decides on the acceptance of new national associations, and holds elections. Congress elects the President of FIFA, its general secretary, and the other members of the FIFA Council in the year following the FIFA World Cup.[33]  FIFA Council \u2013 formerly called the FIFA Executive Committee and chaired by the president \u2013 is the organization's main decision-making body in the intervals of Congress. The council comprises 37 people: the president; 8 vice-presidents; and 28 members from the confederations, with at least one of them being a woman. The executive committee is the body that decides which country will host the World Cup.  The president and the general secretary are the main office holders of FIFA and are in charge of its daily administration, carried in by the general secretariat, with its staff of approximately 280 members. Gianni Infantino is the current president, elected on 26 February 2016 at an extraordinary FIFA Congress session after former president Sepp Blatter was suspended pending a corruption investigation.[34][35]  FIFA's worldwide organizational structure also consists of several other bodies under the authority of the FIFA Council or created by Congress as standing committees. Among those bodies are the FIFA Emergency Committee, the FIFA Ethics Committee, the Finance Committee, the Disciplinary Committee, and the Referees Committee.  The FIFA Emergency Committee deals with all matters requiring immediate settlement in the time frame between the regular meetings of the FIFA Council.[36][37] The Emergency Committee consists of the FIFA president as well as one member from each confederation.[38] Emergency Committee decisions made are immediately put into legal effect, although they need to be ratified at the next Executive Committee meeting.[39]  FIFA publishes its results according to International Financial Reporting Standards. The total compensation for the management committee in 2011 was 30 million for 35 people. Blatter, the only full-time person on the committee, earned approximately two million Swiss francs, 1.2 million in salary, and the rest in bonuses.[40][41][42] A report in London's The Sunday Times in June 2014 said the members of the committee had their salaries doubled from $100,000 to $200,000 during the year. The report also said leaked documents had indicated $4.4 million in secret bonuses had been paid to the committee members following the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.[43]  The laws that govern football known officially as the Laws of the Game, are not solely the responsibility of FIFA; they are maintained by a body called the International Football Association Board (IFAB). FIFA has members on its board (four representatives); the other four are provided by the football associations of the United Kingdom: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, who jointly established IFAB in 1882 and are recognized for the creation and history of the game. Changes to the Laws of the Game must be agreed upon by at least six delegates.  The FIFA Statutes form the overarching document guiding FIFA's governing system. The governing system is divided into separate bodies with the appropriate powers to create a system of checks and balances. It consists of four general bodies: the Congress, the executive committee, the general Secretariat, and standing and ad hoc committees.[44]  FIFA frequently takes active roles in the running of the sport and developing the game around the world. One of its sanctions is to suspend teams and associated members from international competition when a government interferes in the running of FIFA's associate member organizations or if the associate is not functioning correctly.  A 2007 FIFA ruling that a player can be registered with a maximum of three clubs and appear in official matches for a maximum of two in a year measured from 1 July to 30 June has led to controversy, especially in those countries whose seasons cross that date barrier, as in the case of two former Ireland internationals. As a direct result of this controversy, FIFA modified this ruling the following year to accommodate transfers between leagues with out-of-phase seasons.  FIFA now permits the use of video evidence during matches, as well as for subsequent sanctions. However, for most of FIFA's history it stood opposed to its use.[45] The 1970 meeting of the International Football Association Board \"agreed to request the television authorities to refrain from any slow-motion play-back which reflected, or might reflect, adversely on any decision of the referee\".[46] As recently as 2008 FIFA president Sepp Blatter said: \"Let it be as it is and let's leave [football] with errors. The television companies will have the right to say [the referee] was right or wrong, but still, the referee makes the decision \u2013 a man, not a machine.\"[47] This stance was finally overturned on 3 March 2018, when the IFAB wrote video assistant referees (also known as VARs) into the Laws of the Game permanently.[48] Their use remains optional for competitions.  In early July 2012 FIFA sanctioned the use of goal-line technology, subject to rules specified by the International Football Association Board (IFAB), who had officially approved its use by amending the Laws of the Game to permit (but not require) its use.[49][50] This followed a high-profile incident during a second-round game in the 2010 FIFA World Cup between England and Germany, where a shot by Englishman Frank Lampard, which would have levelled the scores at 2\u20132 in a match that ultimately ended in a 4\u20131 German victory, crossed the line but was not seen to do so by the match officials, which led FIFA officials to declare that they would re-examine the use of goal-line technology.[51]  On 28 February 2022, due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and by a recommendation by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), FIFA suspended the participation of Russia.[52][53]  The Russian Football Union unsuccessfully appealed the FIFA ban to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which upheld the ban.[54] Some observers, while approving of the boycott of Russia, have pointed out that FIFA did not boycott Saddam Hussein's Iraq as an aggressor during the Iran\u2013Iraq War,[55] Saudi Arabia for its military intervention in Yemen,[56] Qatar for its human rights violations,[57][58] or the United States for the actions of the U.S. military during the Iraq War.[59] However, this full ban was partially lifted in October 2023 when it was decided that their men's and women's U-17 teams were allowed to return to international competitions.   FIFA previously banned Indonesia due to government intervention within the team. FIFA requires members to play \"with no influence from third parties\".[60]  FIFA holds an annual awards ceremony, The Best FIFA Football Awards since 2016, which recognizes both individual and team achievements in international association football. Individually, the top men's player is awarded The Best FIFA Men's Player, and the top women's player is The Best FIFA Women's Player. Other prominent awards are The Best FIFA Football Coach and FIFA FIFPro World11.  In 2000, FIFA presented two awards, FIFA Club of the Century and FIFA Player of the Century, to decide the greatest football club and player of the 20th century. Real Madrid was the club winner, while Diego Maradona and Pel\u00e9 were the joint player's winners.

The Secret World of FIFA: Bribes, Vote-Rigging, and Ticket Scandals (HarperCollins) caused controversy within the football world by detailing an alleged international cash-for-contracts scandal following the collapse of FIFA's marketing partner International Sport and Leisure (ISL) and revealed how some football officials had been urged to secretly repay the sweeteners they received. The book also alleged that vote-rigging had occurred in the fight for Sepp Blatter's continued control of FIFA as the organization's president. Shortly after the release of Foul! a BBC Panorama expos\u00e9 by Jennings and BBC producer Roger Corke, screened on 11 June 2006, reported that Blatter was being investigated by Swiss police over his role in a secret deal to repay more than \u00a31m worth of bribes pocketed by football officials. Lord Triesman, the former chairman of the English Football Association, described FIFA as an organization that \"behaves like a mafia family,\" highlighting the organization's \"decades-long traditions of bribes, bungs, and corruption\".[96]  All testimonies offered in the Panorama expos\u00e9 were provided through a disguised voice, appearance, or both, save one: Mel Brennan, a former CONCACAF official, became the first high-level football insider to go public with substantial allegations of corruption, nonfeasance, and malfeasance by CONCACAF and FIFA leadership. Brennan\u2014the highest-level African-American in the history of world football governance\u2014joined Jennings, Trinidadian journalist Lisana Liburd, and many others in exposing allegedly inappropriate allocations of money by CONCACAF and drew connections between ostensible CONCACAF criminality and similar behaviours at FIFA. Since then, and in the light of fresh allegations of corruption by FIFA in late 2010,[97] both Jennings and Brennan remain highly critical of FIFA. Brennan has called directly for an alternative to FIFA to be considered by the stakeholders of the sport worldwide.[98]  In a further Panorama expos\u00e9 broadcast on 29 November 2010, Jennings alleged that three senior FIFA officials, Nicolas Leoz, Issa Hayatou and Ricardo Teixeira, had been paid huge bribes by ISL between 1989 and 1999, which FIFA had failed to investigate. Jennings claimed they appeared on a list of 175 bribes paid by ISL, totalling about $100 million. A former ISL executive said there were suspicions within the company that they were only awarded the marketing contract for successive World Cups by paying bribes to FIFA officials. The program also alleged that another current official, Jack Warner, has been repeatedly involved in reselling World Cup tickets to touts; Blatter said that FIFA had not investigated the allegation because it had not been told about it via 'official channels.'  Panorama also alleged that FIFA requires nations bidding to host the World Cup to agree to implement special laws, including a blanket tax exemption for FIFA and its corporate sponsors and limitation of workers rights. Contrary to FIFA's demands, these conditions were revealed by the Dutch government, resulting in them being told by FIFA that their bid could be adversely affected. Following Jennings' earlier investigations, he was banned from all FIFA press conferences for reasons he claimed had not been made clear. The accused officials failed to answer questions about his latest allegations verbally or by letter.  Prime Minister David Cameron and Andy Anson, head of England's World Cup bid, criticized the timing of the broadcast three days before FIFA decided on the host for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, because it might damage England's bid; the voters included officials accused by the program.[99][100]  In June 2011, it came to light that the International Olympic Committee had started inquiry proceedings against FIFA honorary president Jo\u00e3o Havelange into claims of bribery. Panorama alleged that Havelange accepted a $1\u00a0million 'bung' in 1997 from ISL. The IOC stated that it \"takes all allegations of corruption very seriously, and we would always ask for any evidence of wrongdoing involving any IOC members to be passed to our ethics commission\".[101]  In a 2014 interview, American sportswriter Dave Zirin said that corruption is endemic to FIFA leadership and that the organization should be abolished for the game's good. He said that currently, FIFA is in charge of both monitoring corruption in association football matches and marketing and selling the sport, but that two \"separate\" organizational bodies are needed: an organizational body that monitors corruption and match-fixing and the like and an organization that's responsible for marketing and sponsorships and selling the sport. Zirin said the idea of having a single organization responsible for both seems highly ineffective and detrimental to the sport.[102]  In May 2015, 14 people were arrested, including nine FIFA officials, after being accused of corruption.[103]  In the 2022 World Cup bid, Qatar was honoured to host the World Cup.  Since then it has been discovered that Qatar paid as much as 200 billion dollars to host the World Cup. This information was discovered by the Tass news agency in Russia.[104]  Between 2013 and 2015 four individuals, and two sports television rights corporations pleaded guilty to United States financial misconduct charges. The pleas of Chuck Blazer, Jos\u00e9 Hawilla, Daryan Warner, Darrell Warner, Traffic Group and Traffic Sports USA were unsealed in May 2015.[9] In another 2015 case, Singapore also imposed a 6-year \"harshest sentence ever received for match-fixing\" on match-fixer Eric Ding who had bribed three Lebanese FIFA football officials with prostitutes as an inducement to fix future matches that they would officiate, as well as perverting the course of justice.[105]  Fourteen FIFA officials and marketing executives were indicted by the United States Department of Justice in May 2015. The officials were arrested in Switzerland and are in the process of extradition to the US. Specific charges (brought under the RICO act) include wire fraud, racketeering, and money laundering.[106]  \"Swiss authorities say they have also opened a separate criminal investigation into FIFA's operations pertaining to the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids\".[107]  FIFA's top officials were arrested at a hotel in Switzerland on suspicion of receiving bribes totalling $100m (\u00a365m). The US Department of Justice stated that nine FIFA officials and four executives of sports management companies were arrested and accused of over $150m in bribes.[108] The UK Shadow Home Secretary and Labour Member of Parliament, Andy Burnham, stated in May 2015 that England should boycott the 2018 World Cup against corruption in FIFA and military aggression by Russia.[109]  FIFA's choice to award the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 World Cup to Qatar has been widely criticized by media.[110][111][112][113] It has been alleged that some FIFA inside sources insist that the Russian kickbacks of cash and gifts given to FIFA executive members were enough to secure the Russian 2018 bid weeks before the result was announced.[114] Sepp Blatter was widely criticized in the media for giving a warning about the \"evils of the media\" in a speech to FIFA executive committee members shortly before they voted on the hosting of the 2018 World Cup, a reference to The Sunday Times expos\u00e9s,[115] and the Panorama investigation.[116]  Two members of FIFA's executive committee were banned from all football-related activity in November 2010 for allegedly offering to sell their votes to undercover newspaper reporters. In early May 2011, a British parliamentary inquiry into why England failed to secure the 2018 finals was told by a member of parliament, Damian Collins, that there was evidence from The Sunday Times newspaper that Issa Hayatou of Cameroon and Jacques Anouma of Ivory Coast were paid by Qatar. Qatar has categorically denied the allegations, as have Hayatou and Anouma.[117]  FIFA president Blatter said, as of 23\u00a0May\u00a02011[update], that the British newspaper The Sunday Times has agreed to bring its whistle-blowing source to meet senior FIFA officials, who will decide whether to order a new investigation into alleged World Cup bidding corruption. \"[The Sunday Times] are happy, they agreed that they will bring this whistleblower here to Z\u00fcrich and then we will have a discussion, an investigation of this\", Blatter said.  Specifically, the whistle-blower claims that FIFA executive committee members Issa Hayatou and Jacques Anouma were paid $1.5\u00a0million to vote for Qatar.[118][119] The emirate's bid beat the United States in a final round of voting last December. Blatter did not rule out reopening the 2022 vote if corruption could be proved, but urged taking the matter \"step by step\". The FIFA president said his organization is \"anxiously awaiting\" more evidence before asking its ethics committee to examine allegations made in Britain's Parliament in early May 2011.  Hayatou, who is from Cameroon, leads the Confederation of African Football and is a FIFA vice-president. Anouma is president of Ivorian Football Federation. The whistle-blower said Qatar agreed to pay a third African voter, Amos Adamu, for his support. The Nigerian was later suspended from voting after a FIFA ethics court ruled he solicited bribes from undercover Sunday Times reporters posing as lobbyists. Blatter said the newspaper and its whistle-blower would meet with FIFA secretary general, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Valcke, and legal director, Marco Villiger.  Allegations against FIFA officials have also been made to the UK Parliament by David Triesman, the former head of England's bid and the English Football Association. Triesman told the lawmakers that four long-standing FIFA executive committee members\u2014Jack Warner, Nicol\u00e1s Leoz, Ricardo Teixeira and Worawi Makudi\u2014engaged in \"improper and unethical\" conduct in the 2018 bidding, which was won by Russia. All six FIFA voters have denied wrongdoing.[120]  On 28 September 2015, Sepp Blatter suggested that the 2018 World Cup being awarded to Russia was planned before the voting, and that the 2022 World Cup would have then been awarded to the United States. However, this plan changed after the election ballot, and the 2022 World Cup was awarded to Qatar instead of the U.S.[121][122]  According to leaked documents seen by The Sunday Times, Qatari state-run television channel Al Jazeera secretly offered $400\u00a0million to FIFA, for broadcasting rights, just 21 days before FIFA announced that Qatar would hold the 2022 World Cup.[123][124]  On 17 July 2012, in the wake of announced anti-corruption reforms by Sepp Blatter, the president of the FIFA,[125] the organization appointed U.S. lawyer Michael J. Garcia as the chairman of the investigative chamber of FIFA Ethics Committee, while German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert was appointed as the chairman of the Ethics Committee's adjudication chamber.[126]  In August 2012, Garcia declared his intention to investigate the bidding process and decision to respectively award the right to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup to Russia and Qatar by the FIFA Executive Committee.[127] Garcia delivered his subsequent 350-page report in September 2014, and Eckert then announced that it would not be made public for legal reasons.[128]  On 13 November 2014, Eckert released a 42-page summary of his findings after reviewing Garcia's report. The summary cleared both Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing during the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups,[129] leaving Russia and Qatar free to stage their respective World Cups.[130]  FIFA welcomed \"the fact that a degree of closure has been reached\", while the Associated Press wrote that the Eckert summary \"was denounced by critics as a whitewash\".[130] Hours after the Eckert summary was released, Garcia himself criticized it for being \"materially incomplete\" with \"erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions\", while declaring his intention to appeal to FIFA's Appeal Committee.[129] On 16 December 2014, FIFA's Appeal Committee dismissed Garcia's appeal against the Eckert summary as \"not admissible\". FIFA also stated that Eckert's summary was \"neither legally binding nor appealable\".[131] A day later, Garcia resigned from his role as FIFA ethics investigator in protest of FIFA's conduct, citing a \"lack of leadership\" and lost confidence in the independence of Eckert from FIFA.[132] In June 2015, Swiss authorities claimed the report was of \"little value\".[133]  In November 2022, the FIFA officials told players not to get involved in politics but focus on sports when they are in Qatar.[134] A few weeks earlier, the football associations and players of Denmark and Australia criticized Qatar for this.[135][136]  FIFA announced on 25 May 2011 that it had opened the investigation to examine the conduct of four officials\u2014Mohamed Bin Hammam and Jack Warner, along with Caribbean Football Union (CFU) officials Debbie Minguell and Jason Sylvester\u2014in relation to claims made by executive committee member, Chuck Blazer.[137][138][139] Blazer, who was at the time, the general secretary of the CONCACAF confederation, has alleged that violations were committed under the FIFA code of ethics during a meeting organized by Bin Hammam and Warner on 10 and 11 May\u2014the same time Lord Triesman had accused Warner of demanding money for a World Cup 2018 vote\u2014in relation to the 2011 FIFA presidential election,[140] in which Bin Hammam, who also played a key role in the Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid, allegedly offered financial incentives for votes cast in his favour during the presidential election.  As a result of the investigation both Bin Hammam and Warner were suspended.[141] Warner reacted to his suspension by questioning Blatter's conduct and adding that FIFA secretary general, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Valcke, had told him via e-mail that Qatar had bought the 2022 World Cup.[142][143] Valcke subsequently issued a statement denying he had suggested it was bribery, saying instead that the country had \"used its financial muscle to lobby for support\". Qatar officials denied any impropriety.[144] Bin Hammam also responded by writing to FIFA, protesting unfair treatment in suspension by the FIFA Ethics Committee and FIFA administration.[145]  Further evidence emerged of alleged corruption. On 30 May 2011, Fred Lunn, vice-president of the Bahamas Football Association, said that he was given $40,000 in cash[146] as an incitement to vote for FIFA presidential candidate, Mohamed bin Hammam. In addition, on 11 June 2011 Louis Giskus, president of the Surinamese Football Association, alleged that he was given $40,000 in cash for \"development projects\" as an incentive to vote for Bin Hammam.[147]  After being re-elected as president of FIFA, Sepp Blatter responded to the allegations by promising to reform FIFA in wake of the bribery scandal, with Danny Jordaan, CEO of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, saying there is great expectation for reform.[148] Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger is being tipped for a role on the newly proposed 'Solutions Committee', and former Netherlands national football team player Johan Cruyff was also being linked with a role.[143][149]  UEFA secretary-general Gianni Infantino said he hopes for \"concrete\" measures to be taken by the world game's authority. Saying that \"the UEFA executive committee has taken note of the will of FIFA to take concrete and effective measures for good governance ... [and is] following the situation closely.\"[150]  IOC president Jacques Rogge commented on the situation by saying that he believes FIFA \"can emerge stronger\" from its worst-ever crisis, stating that \"I will not point a finger and lecture ... I am sure FIFA can emerge stronger and from within\".[151]  Several of FIFA's partners and sponsors have raised concerns about the allegations of corruption, including Coca-Cola, Adidas, Emirates and Visa.[152][153][154] Coca-Cola raised concerns by saying \"the current allegations being raised are distressing and bad for the sport\"; with Adidas saying \"the negative tenor of the public debate around Fifa at the moment is neither good for football nor for Fifa and its partners\"; moreover Emirates raised its concerns by saying \"we hope that these issues will be resolved as soon as possible\"; and Visa adding \"the current situation is clearly not good for the game and we ask that Fifa take all necessary steps to resolve the concerns that have been raised.\"[152]  Australian Sports Minister Mark Arbib said it was clear FIFA needed to change, saying \"there is no doubt there needs to be reform of FIFA. This is something that we're hearing worldwide\", with Australian Senator Nick Xenophon accusing FIFA of \"scamming\" the country out of the A$46\u00a0million (US$35\u00a0million) it spent on the Australia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid, saying that \"until the investigation into FIFA has been completed, Australia must hold off spending any more taxpayers' money on any future World Cup bids.\"[155]  Theo Zwanziger, president of the German Football Association, also called on FIFA to re-examine the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.[156]  Transparency International, which had called on FIFA to postpone the election pending a full independent investigation, renewed its call on FIFA to change its governance structure.[157]  Moreover, former Argentine football player Diego Maradona was critical of FIFA in light of the corruption scandal, comparing members of the board to dinosaurs. He said \"Fifa is a big museum. They are dinosaurs who do not want to relinquish power. It's always going to be the same.\"[158] In October 2011, Dick Pound criticized the organization, saying, \"FIFA has fallen far short of a credible demonstration that it recognizes the many problems it faces, that it has the will to solve them, that it is willing to be transparent about what it is doing and what it finds, and that its conduct in the future will be such that the public can be confident in the governance of the sport.\"[159]  In 2018, FIFA revised its code of ethics to remove corruption as one of the enumerated bases of ethical violations.[160] It retained bribery, misappropriation of funds and manipulation of competitions as offences, but added a statute of limitation clause that those offences could not be pursued after a ten-year period.[160]  The revision also made it an offence to make public statements of a defamatory nature against FIFA.[160] Alexandra Wrage, a former member of the FIFA governance committee and an expert in anti-bribery compliance, said that of the revision that \"the real value to FIFA is the chilling effect this will have on critics\".[160] "},{"title":"The Troubles","content":"  British Army: 705(inc.

The conflict was primarily political and nationalistic, fuelled by historical events.[32] It also had an ethnic or sectarian dimension[33] but despite use of the terms Protestant and Catholic to refer to the two sides, it was not a religious conflict.[14][34] A key issue was the status of Northern Ireland. Unionists and loyalists, who for historical reasons were mostly Ulster Protestants, wanted Northern Ireland to remain within the United Kingdom. Irish nationalists and republicans, who were mostly Irish Catholics, wanted Northern Ireland to leave the United Kingdom and join a united Ireland.  The conflict began during a campaign by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association to end discrimination against the Catholic-nationalist minority by the Protestant-unionist government and local authorities.[35][36] The government attempted to suppress the protests. The police, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), were overwhelmingly Protestant and known for sectarianism and police brutality. The campaign was also violently opposed by Ulster loyalists, who believed it was a front for republican political activity. Increasing tensions led to the August 1969 riots and the deployment of British troops, in what became the British Army's longest operation.[37] \"Peace walls\" were built in some areas to keep the two communities apart. Some Catholics initially welcomed the British Army as a more neutral force than the RUC, but soon came to see it as hostile and biased, particularly after Bloody Sunday in 1972.[38]  The main participants in the Troubles were republican paramilitaries such as the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA); loyalist paramilitaries such as the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Ulster Defence Association (UDA); British state security forces such as the British Army and RUC; and political activists. The security forces of the Republic of Ireland played a smaller role. Republicans carried out a guerrilla campaign against British forces as well as a bombing campaign against infrastructural, commercial, and political targets. Loyalists attacked republicans\/nationalists and the wider Catholic community in what they described as retaliation. At times, there were bouts of sectarian tit-for-tat violence, as well as feuds within and between paramilitary groups. The British security forces undertook policing and counterinsurgency, primarily against republicans. There were incidents of collusion between British state forces and loyalist paramilitaries (see Stevens Inquiries). The Troubles also involved numerous riots, mass protests, and acts of civil disobedience, and led to increased segregation and the creation of temporary no-go areas.  More than 3,500 people were killed in the conflict, of whom 52% were civilians, 32% were members of the British security forces, and 16% were members of paramilitary groups.[9] Republican paramilitaries were responsible for some 60% of the deaths, loyalists 30%, and security forces 10%.[39] The Northern Ireland peace process led to paramilitary ceasefires and talks between the main political parties, which resulted in the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. This Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of \"power-sharing\" and it included acceptance of the principle of consent, commitment to civil and political rights, parity of esteem, police reform, paramilitary disarmament and early release of paramilitary prisoners. There has been sporadic violence since the Agreement, including punishment attacks,[40] loyalist gangs' control of major organised crime rackets (e.g., drugs supply, community coercion and violence, intimidation),[41][42][43][44][45][46] and violent crime linked to dissident republican groups.[4][30][47]  The word \"troubles\" has been used as a synonym for violent conflict for centuries. It was used to describe the 17th-century Wars of the Three Kingdoms by all three national parliaments. For example, after the Restoration in 1660, the English Act of free and general pardon, indemnity and oblivion starts with \"The King's most excellent Majesty, taking into his gracious and serious consideration the long and great troubles\u00a0...\"; as does the similar act in Scotland: \"The king's most excellent majesty, considering that by the late troubles diverse of his subjects\u00a0...\" (Scottish Parliament 1662); and by the Irish Parliament in the Act of Explanation (1665) \"our royal father of blessed memory had been forced, during the late troubles, to make with the Irish subjects of that our kingdom\" (Irish Parliament 1665, \u00a7 2). The term was used to describe the Irish revolutionary period in the early twentieth century.[48] It was subsequently adopted to refer to the escalating violence in Northern Ireland after 1969.[49][50][51][52]  In 1609, Scottish and English settlers, known as planters, were given land escheated from the native Irish in the Plantation of Ulster.[53] Coupled with Protestant immigration to \"unplanted\" areas of Ulster, particularly Antrim and Down, this resulted in conflict between the native Catholics and the \"planters\", leading in turn to two bloody religious conflicts known as the Irish Confederate Wars (1641\u20131653) and the Williamite war (1689\u20131691), both of which resulted in Protestant victories.  Anglican dominance in Ireland was ensured by the passage of the Penal Laws that curtailed the religious, legal, and political rights of anyone (including both Catholics and Protestant Dissenters, such as Presbyterians) who did not conform to the state church, the Anglican Church of Ireland. As the Penal Laws started to be phased out in the latter part of the 18th century, there was more competition for land, as restrictions were lifted on the Irish Catholic ability to rent. With Irish Catholics allowed to buy land and enter trades from which they had formerly been banned, tensions arose resulting in the Protestant \"Peep o'Day Boys\"[54] and Catholic \"Defenders\". This created polarisation between the communities and a dramatic reduction in reformers among Protestants, many of whom had been growing more receptive to democratic reform.[54]  Following the foundation of the republican Society of the United Irishmen by Presbyterians, Catholics, and liberal Anglicans, and the resulting failed Irish Rebellion of 1798, sectarian violence between Catholics and Protestants continued. The Orange Order (founded 1795), with its stated goal of upholding the Protestant faith and loyalty to the heirs of William of Orange, dates from this period and remains active to this day.[55]  With the Acts of Union 1800 (which came into force on 1 January 1801), a new political framework was formed with the abolition of the Irish Parliament and incorporation of Ireland into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The result was a closer tie between Anglicans and the formerly republican Presbyterians as part of a \"loyal\" Protestant community. Although Catholic emancipation was achieved in 1829, largely eliminating official discrimination against Roman Catholics (then around 75% of Ireland's population), Dissenters, and Jews, the Repeal Association's campaign to repeal the 1801 Union failed.  In the late 19th century, the Home Rule movement was created and served to define the divide between most nationalists (usually Catholics) who sought the restoration of an Irish Parliament, and most unionists (usually Protestants) who were afraid of being a minority under a Catholic-dominated Irish Parliament and who tended to support continuing union with Britain.  Unionists and Home Rule advocates were the main political factions in late 19th- and early 20th-century Ireland.[56]  By the second decade of the 20th century, Home Rule, or limited Irish self-government, was on the brink of being conceded due to the agitation of the Irish Parliamentary Party. In response to the campaign for Home Rule which started in the 1870s, unionists, mostly Protestant and largely concentrated in Ulster, had resisted both self-government and independence for Ireland, fearing for their future in an overwhelmingly Catholic country dominated by the Roman Catholic Church. In 1912, unionists led by Edward Carson signed the Ulster Covenant and pledged to resist Home Rule by force if necessary. To this end, they formed the paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF).[57]  In response, nationalists led by Eoin MacNeill formed the Irish Volunteers in 1913, whose goal was to oppose the UVF and ensure enactment of the Third Home Rule Bill in the event of British or unionist refusal. The outbreak of the First World War in 1914, and Ireland's involvement in the war, temporarily averted possible civil war in Ireland and delayed the resolution of the question of Irish independence. Home Rule, although passed in the British Parliament with Royal Assent, was suspended for the duration of the war.  The Irish Volunteers split, with a majority, known as the National Volunteers, supporting the war effort, and some of them joining Irish regiments of the New British Army. Many of those who stayed were radical nationalists, among them Irish Republican Brotherhood infiltrators. From these ranks came those who launched the Easter Rising in Dublin in 1916, led by Patrick Pearse and James Connolly. Two-and-a-half years after the executions of sixteen of the Rising's leaders, the separatist Sinn F\u00e9in party won the December 1918 general election in Ireland with 47% of the vote and a majority of seats, and set up the 1919 First D\u00e1il (Irish Parliament) in Dublin. Their victory was aided by the threat of conscription for First World War service. The Irish War for Independence followed, leading to eventual independence in 1922 for the Irish Free State, which comprised 26 of the 32 Irish counties. In Ulster, particularly in the six counties which became Northern Ireland, Sinn F\u00e9in fared relatively poorly in the 1918 election, and unionists won a majority.[57]  The Government of Ireland Act 1920 partitioned the island of Ireland into two separate jurisdictions, Southern Ireland and Northern Ireland, both devolved regions of the United Kingdom. This partition of Ireland was confirmed when the Parliament of Northern Ireland exercised its right in December 1922 under the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 to opt out of the newly established Irish Free State.[58] A part of the treaty signed in 1922 mandated that a boundary commission would sit to decide where the frontier of the northern state would be in relation to its southern neighbour. After the Irish Civil War of 1922\u20131923, this part of the treaty was given less priority by the new Dublin government led by W. T. Cosgrave, and was quietly dropped. As counties Fermanagh and Tyrone and border areas of Londonderry, Armagh, and Down were mainly nationalist, the Irish Boundary Commission could reduce Northern Ireland to four counties or fewer.[57] In October 1922, the Irish Free State government established the North-Eastern Boundary Bureau (NEBB), a government office which by 1925 had prepared 56 boxes of files to argue its case for areas of Northern Ireland to be transferred to the Free State.[59]  Northern Ireland remained a part of the United Kingdom, albeit under a separate system of government whereby it was given its own parliament and devolved government. While this arrangement met the desires of unionists to remain part of the United Kingdom, nationalists largely viewed the partition of Ireland as an illegal and arbitrary division of the island against the will of the majority of its people. They argued that the Northern Ireland state was neither legitimate nor democratic, but created with a deliberately gerrymandered unionist majority. Catholics initially composed about 35% of its population.[60] A total of 557 people, mostly Catholics, were killed in political or sectarian violence from 1920 to 1922 in the six counties that would become Northern Ireland, both during and after the Irish War of Independence.[61] The result was communal strife between Catholics and Protestants,[62] with some historians describing this violence, especially that in Belfast, as a pogrom,[63][64] although historian Peter Hart argues that the term is not appropriate given the reciprocity of violence in Northern Ireland. (see Belfast Pogrom and Bloody Sunday (1921)).[65]  A marginalised remnant of the Irish Republican Army survived the Irish Civil War. This would come to have a major impact on Northern Ireland. Although the IRA was proscribed on both sides of the new Irish border, it remained ideologically committed to overthrowing both the Northern Ireland and the Free State governments by force of arms to unify Ireland. The government of Northern Ireland passed the Special Powers Act in 1922, giving sweeping powers to the government and police to intern suspects without trial and to administer corporal punishment such as flogging to re-establish or preserve law and order. The Act continued to be used against nationalists long after the violence of this period had come to an end.[66] Various unionist militias were also incorporated into state structures, including the Ulster Special Constabulary, which Allen Feldman argues \"emulated the state's fusion of repressive and ideological apparatuses\".[67]  In 1920, in local elections held under proportional representation, nationalists had won control over many local governments, including the County Councils of Fermanagh and Tyrone, and the Londonderry Borough Council governing Derry City. In response, in 1922 the new unionist government re-drew the electoral boundaries to give its supporters a disproportionate majority and abolished proportional representation in favour of first past the post voting.[68] This resulted in control by unionists of areas such as Derry City, Fermanagh, and Tyrone, where they were actually a minority of voters.[69]  The two sides' positions became strictly defined following this period. From a unionist perspective, Northern Ireland's nationalists were inherently disloyal and determined to force unionists into a united Ireland. This threat was seen as justifying preferential treatment of unionists in housing, employment, and other fields.[citation needed] The prevalence of larger families and thus the potential for a more rapid population growth among Catholics was seen as a threat.[citation needed] Unionist governments ignored Edward Carson's warning in 1921 that alienating Catholics would make Northern Ireland inherently unstable. After the early 1920s, there were occasional incidents of sectarian unrest in Northern Ireland. These included severe rioting in Belfast in the 1930s and 1950s, and the IRA's brief Northern Campaign in the 1940s and Border Campaign between 1956 and 1962, which did not enjoy broad popular support among nationalists. After the IRA called off its campaign in 1962, Northern Ireland became relatively stable for a few years.[57]  There is little agreement on the exact date of the start of the Troubles. Different writers have suggested different dates. These include the formation of the modern Ulster Volunteer Force in 1966,[1] the civil rights march in Derry on 5 October 1968, the beginning of the 'Battle of the Bogside' on 12 August 1969, or the deployment of British troops on 14 August 1969.[57]  In March and April 1966, Irish nationalists\/republicans held parades throughout Ireland to mark the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising. On 8 March, a group of Irish republicans dynamited Nelson's Pillar in Dublin. At the time, the IRA was weak and not engaged in armed action, but some unionists warned it was about to be revived to launch another campaign against Northern Ireland.[70][71] In April 1966, loyalists led by Ian Paisley, a Protestant fundamentalist preacher, founded the Ulster Constitution Defence Committee (UCDC). It set up a paramilitary-style wing called the Ulster Protestant Volunteers (UPV)[70] to oust Terence O'Neill, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. Although O'Neill was a unionist, they viewed him as being too 'soft' on the civil rights movement and opposed his policies.[72] At the same time, a loyalist group calling itself the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) emerged in the Shankill area of Belfast. It was led by Gusty Spence, a former British soldier. Many of its members were also members of the UCDC and UPV.[73] In April and May 1966, the UVF petrol bombed a number of Catholic homes, schools, and businesses. A firebomb killed an elderly Protestant widow, Matilda Gould.[70] On 21 May, the UVF issued a statement declaring \"war\" against the IRA and anyone helping it.[74] The UVF fatally shot a Catholic civilian, John Scullion, as he walked home on 27 May. A month later it shot three Catholic civilians as they left a pub, killing Peter Ward, a Catholic from the Falls Road.[70][74] Shortly after, the UVF was proscribed by the Northern Ireland government.[70] The UVF is still considered a terrorist organization by the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.[75]  In the mid-1960s, a non-violent civil rights campaign began in Northern Ireland. It comprised groups such as the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA), the Campaign for Social Justice, the Derry Citizens' Action Committee, and People's Democracy,[76] whose stated goals were:  Some suspected and accused NICRA of being a republican front-group whose ultimate goal was to unite Ireland. Although republicans and some members of the IRA (then led by Cathal Goulding and pursuing a non-violent agenda) helped to create and drive the movement, they did not control it and were not a dominant faction within it.[57][81][82][83][84]  On 20 June 1968, civil rights activists, including nationalist Member of Parliament (MP) Austin Currie, protested against housing discrimination by squatting in a house in Caledon, County Tyrone. The local council had allocated the house to an unmarried 19-year-old Protestant (Emily Beattie, the secretary of a local UUP politician) instead of either of two large Catholic families with children.[85] RUC officers \u2013 one of whom was Beattie's brother \u2013 forcibly removed the activists.[85] Two days before the protest, the two Catholic families who had been squatting in the house next door were removed by police.[86] Currie had brought their grievance to the local council and to Stormont, but had been told to leave. The incident invigorated the civil rights movement.[87]  On 24 August 1968, the civil rights movement held its first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. Many more marches were held over the following year. Loyalists (especially members of the UPV) attacked some of the marches and held counter-demonstrations in a bid to get the marches banned.[85] Because of the lack of police reaction to the attacks, nationalists saw the RUC, which was almost wholly Protestant, as backing the loyalists and allowing the attacks to occur.[88] On 5 October 1968, a civil rights march in Derry was banned by the Northern Ireland government.[89] When marchers defied the ban, RUC officers surrounded the marchers and beat them indiscriminately and without provocation. More than 100 people were injured, including a number of nationalist politicians.[89] The incident was filmed by television news crews and shown around the world.[90] It caused outrage among Catholics and nationalists, sparking two days of rioting in Derry between nationalists and the RUC.[89]  A few days later, a student civil rights group, People's Democracy, was formed in Belfast.[85] In late November, O'Neill promised the civil rights movement some concessions, but these were seen as too little by nationalists and too much by loyalists. On 1 January 1969, People's Democracy began a four-day march from Belfast to Derry, which was repeatedly harassed and attacked by loyalists. At Burntollet Bridge, the marchers were attacked by about 200 loyalists, including some off-duty police officers, armed with iron bars, bricks, and bottles in a planned ambush. When the march reached Derry City, it was again attacked. The marchers claimed that police did nothing to protect them and that some officers helped the attackers.[91] That night, RUC officers went on a rampage in the Bogside area of Derry, attacking Catholic homes, attacking and threatening residents, and hurling sectarian abuse.[91] Residents then sealed off the Bogside with barricades to keep the police out, creating \"Free Derry\", which was briefly a no-go area for the security forces.[92][93]  In March and April 1969, loyalists bombed water and electricity installations in Northern Ireland, blaming them on the dormant IRA and elements of the civil rights movement. Some attacks left much of Belfast without power and water. Loyalists hoped the bombings would force O'Neill to resign and bring an end to any concessions to nationalists.[94][95] There were six bombings between 30 March and 26 April.[94][96] All were widely blamed on the IRA, and British soldiers were sent to guard installations. Unionist support for O'Neill waned, and on 28 April he resigned as prime minister.[94]  On 19 April, there were clashes between NICRA marchers, the RUC, and loyalists in the Bogside. RUC officers entered the house of Samuel Devenny (42), an uninvolved Catholic civilian, and beat him along with two of his teenage daughters and a family friend.[94] One of the daughters was beaten unconscious as she lay recovering from surgery.[97] Devenny suffered a heart attack and died on 17 July from his injuries. On 13 July, RUC officers beat another Catholic civilian, Francis McCloskey (67), during clashes in Dungiven. He died of his injuries the next day.[94]  On 12 August, the loyalist Apprentice Boys of Derry were allowed to march along the edge of the Bogside. Taunts and missiles were exchanged between the loyalists and nationalist residents. After being bombarded with stones and petrol bombs from nationalists, the RUC, backed by loyalists, tried to storm the Bogside. The RUC used CS gas, armoured vehicles, and water cannons, but were kept at bay by hundreds of nationalists.[98] The continuous fighting, which became known as the Battle of the Bogside, lasted for three days.  In response to events in Derry, nationalists held protests at RUC bases in Belfast and elsewhere. Some of these led to clashes with the RUC and attacks on RUC bases. In Belfast, loyalists responded by invading nationalist districts, burning houses and businesses. There were gun battles between nationalists and the RUC and between nationalists and loyalists. A group of about 30 IRA members was involved in the fighting in Belfast. The RUC deployed Shorland armoured cars mounted with heavy Browning machine guns. The Shorlands twice opened fire on a block of flats in a nationalist district, killing a nine-year-old boy named Patrick Rooney. RUC officers opened fire on rioters in Armagh, Dungannon, and Coalisland.[57]  During the riots, on 13 August,  Taoiseach Jack Lynch made a television address. He condemned the RUC and said that the Irish Government \"can no longer stand by and see innocent people injured and perhaps worse\".[99] He called for a United Nations peacekeeping force to be deployed and said that Irish Army field hospitals were being set up at the border in County Donegal near Derry. Lynch added that Irish re-unification would be the only permanent solution. Some interpreted the speech as a threat of military intervention.[100] After the riots, Lynch ordered the Irish Army to plan for a possible humanitarian intervention in Northern Ireland. The plan, Exercise Armageddon, was rejected and remained classified for thirty years.[101]  On 14\u201315 August, British troops were deployed in Operation Banner in Derry and Belfast to restore order,[102] but did not try to enter the Bogside, bringing a temporary end to the riots. Ten people had been killed,[103] among them Rooney (the first child killed by police during the conflict),[104] and 745 had been injured, including 154 who suffered gunshot wounds.[105] 154 homes and other buildings were demolished and over 400 needed repairs, of which 83% of the buildings damaged were occupied by Catholics.[105] Between July and 1 September 505 Catholic and 315 Protestant families were forced to flee their homes.[106] The Irish Army set up refugee camps in the Republic near the border (see Gormanston Camp). Nationalists initially welcomed the British Army, as they did not trust the RUC.[107]  On 9 September, the Northern Ireland Joint Security Committee met at Stormont Castle and decided that  A peace line was to be established to separate physically the Falls and the Shankill communities. Initially this would take the form of a temporary barbed wire fence which would be manned by the Army and the Police\u00a0... It was agreed that there should be no question of the peace line becoming permanent although it was acknowledged that the barriers might have to be strengthened in some locations.[108] On 10 September, the British Army started construction of the first \"peace wall\".[109] It was the first of many such walls across Northern Ireland, and still stands today.[110]  After the riots, the Hunt Committee was set up to examine the RUC. It published its report on 12 October, recommending that the RUC become an unarmed force and the B Specials be disbanded. That night, loyalists took to the streets of Belfast in protest at the report. During violence in the Shankill, UVF members shot dead RUC officer Victor Arbuckle. He was the first RUC officer to be killed during the Troubles.[111] In October and December 1969, the UVF carried out a number of small bombings in the Republic of Ireland.[57]  Despite the British government's attempt to do \"nothing that would suggest partiality to one section of the community\" and the improvement of the relationship between the Army and the local population following the Army assistance with flood relief in August 1970, the Falls Curfew and a situation that was described at the time as \"an inflamed sectarian one, which is being deliberately exploited by the IRA and other extremists\" meant that relations between the Catholic population and the British Army rapidly deteriorated.[112]  From 1970 to 1972, an explosion of political violence occurred in Northern Ireland. The deadliest attack in the early 1970s was the McGurk's Bar bombing by the UVF in 1971.[113] The violence peaked in 1972, when nearly 500 people, just over half of them civilians, were killed, the worst year in the entire conflict.[114]  By the end of 1971, 29 barricades were in place in Derry, blocking access to what was known as Free Derry; 16 of these were impassable even to the British Army's one-ton armoured vehicles.[93] Many of the nationalist or republican \"no-go areas\" were controlled by one of the two factions of the Irish Republican Army\u00a0\u2013 the Provisional IRA and Official IRA. There are several reasons offered for why violence escalated in these years.  Unionists say the main reason was the formation of the Provisional IRA and Official IRA, particularly the former.[citation needed] These two groups were formed when the IRA split into the 'Provisional' and 'Official' factions. While the older IRA had embraced non-violent civil agitation,[115] the new Provisional IRA was determined to wage \"armed struggle\" against British rule in Northern Ireland. The new IRA was willing to take on the role of \"defenders of the Catholic community\",[116] rather than seeking working-class ecumenical unity across both communities.  Nationalists point to a number of events in these years to explain the upsurge in violence. One such incident was the Falls Curfew in July 1970, when 3,000 troops imposed a curfew on the nationalist Lower Falls area of Belfast, firing more than 1,500 rounds of ammunition in gun battles with the Official IRA and killing four people. Another was the introduction of internment without trial in 1971 (of 350 initial detainees, none were Protestants).[117] Moreover, due to poor intelligence,[118] very few of those interned were actually republican activists at the time, but some internees became increasingly radicalised as a result of their experiences.[57]  In August 1971, ten civilians were shot dead in the Ballymurphy massacre in Belfast. They were innocent and the killings were unjustified, according to a 2021 coroner's inquest. Nine victims were shot by the British Army.[119]  Bloody Sunday was the shooting dead of thirteen unarmed men by the British Army at a proscribed anti-internment rally in Derry on 30 January 1972 (a fourteenth man died of his injuries some months later), while fifteen other civilians were wounded.[120][121] The march had been organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA). The soldiers involved were members of the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment, also known as \"1 Para\".[122]  This was one of the most prominent events that occurred during the Troubles as it was recorded as the largest number of civilians killed in a single shooting incident.[123] Bloody Sunday greatly increased the hostility of Catholics and Irish nationalists towards the British military and government while significantly elevating tensions. As a result, the Provisional IRA gained more support, especially through rising numbers of recruits in the local areas.[124]  Following the introduction of internment, there were numerous gun battles between the British Army and both the Provisional and Official IRA. These included the Battle at Springmartin and the Battle of Lenadoon. Between 1971 and 1975, 1,981 people were interned: 1,874 were Catholic\/republican, and 107 were Protestant\/loyalist.[125] There were widespread allegations of abuse and even torture of detainees,[126][127] and in 1972, the \"five techniques\" used by the police and army for interrogation were ruled to be illegal following a British government inquiry.[128]  The Provisional IRA, or \"Provos\", as they became known, sought to establish themselves as the defender of the nationalist community.[129][130] The Official IRA (OIRA) began its own armed campaign in reaction to the ongoing violence. The Provisional IRA's offensive campaign began in early 1971 when the Army Council sanctioned attacks on the British Army.[131]  In 1972, the Provisional IRA killed approximately 100 members of the security forces, wounded 500 others, and carried out approximately 1,300 bombings,[132] mostly against commercial targets which they considered \"the artificial economy\".[further explanation needed][114][131][133] Their bombing campaign killed many civilians, notably on Bloody Friday on 21 July, when they set off 22 bombs in the centre of Belfast, killing five civilians, two British soldiers, a Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) reservist, and an Ulster Defence Association (UDA) member.[134][135][136] Ten days later, nine civilians were killed in a triple car bombing in Claudy.[137] The IRA is accused of committing this bombing but no proof for that accusation is yet published.[138][139]  In 1972, the Official IRA's campaign was largely counter-productive.[140] The Aldershot bombing, an attack on the barracks of the Parachute Regiment in retaliation for Bloody Sunday, killed five female cleaners, a gardener and an army chaplain.[141] The Official IRA killed three soldiers in Derry in April, but Joe McCann was killed by the Parachute Regiment in Belfast during the same month.[140] The Official IRA called off its campaign in May 1972.[142]  British troop concentrations peaked at 1:50 of the civilian population, the highest ratio found in the history of counterinsurgency warfare, higher than that achieved during the \"Malayan Emergency\"\/\"Anti-British National Liberation War\" to which the conflict is frequently compared.[143] Operation Motorman, the military operation for the surge, was the biggest military operation in Ireland since the Irish War of Independence.[144] In total, almost 22,000 British forces were involved.[144] In the days before 31 July, about 4,000 extra troops were brought into Northern Ireland.[144]  Despite a temporary ceasefire in 1972 and talks with British officials, the Provisionals were determined to continue their campaign until the achievement of a united Ireland. The UK government in London, believing the Northern Ireland administration incapable of containing the security situation, sought to take over the control of law and order there. As this was unacceptable to the Northern Ireland Government, the British government pushed through emergency legislation (the Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972) which suspended the unionist-controlled Stormont parliament and government, and introduced \"direct rule\" from London. Direct rule was initially intended as a short-term measure; the medium-term strategy was to restore self-government to Northern Ireland on a basis that was acceptable to both unionists and nationalists. Agreement proved elusive, however, and the Troubles continued throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and the 1990s within a context of political deadlock. The existence of \"no-go areas\" in Belfast and Derry was a challenge to the authority of the British government in Northern Ireland, and the British Army demolished the barricades and re-established control over the areas in Operation Motorman on 31 July 1972.[57][133]  In June 1973, following the publication of a British White Paper and a referendum in March on the status of Northern Ireland, a new parliamentary body, the Northern Ireland Assembly, was established. Elections to this body were held on 28 June. In October 1973, mainstream nationalist and unionist parties, along with the British and Irish governments, negotiated the Sunningdale Agreement, which was intended to produce a political settlement within Northern Ireland, but with a so-called \"Irish dimension\" involving the Republic. The agreement provided for \"power-sharing\" \u2013 the creation of an executive containing both unionists and nationalists; and a \"Council of Ireland\" \u2013 a body made up of ministers from Northern Ireland and the Republic that was designed to encourage cross-border co-operation.  Unionists were split over Sunningdale, which was also opposed by the IRA, whose goal remained nothing short of an end to the existence of Northern Ireland as part of the UK. Many unionists opposed the concept of power-sharing, arguing that it was not feasible to share power with nationalists who sought the destruction of the state. Perhaps more significant, however, was the unionist opposition to the \"Irish dimension\" and the Council of Ireland, which was perceived as being an all-Ireland parliament-in-waiting. Remarks by a young Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) councillor Hugh Logue to an audience at Trinity College Dublin that Sunningdale was the tool \"by which the Unionists will be trundled off to a united Ireland\" also damaged chances of significant unionist support for the agreement. In January 1974, Brian Faulkner was narrowly deposed as UUP leader and replaced by Harry West, although Faulkner retained his position as Chief Executive in the new government. A UK general election in February 1974 gave the anti-Sunningdale unionists the opportunity to test unionist opinion with the slogan \"Dublin is only a Sunningdale away\", and the result galvanised their support: they won 11 of the 12 seats, winning 58% of the vote with most of the rest going to nationalists and pro-Sunningdale unionists.[57][133]  Ultimately, the Sunningdale Agreement was brought down by mass action on the part of loyalist paramilitaries and workers, who formed the Ulster Workers' Council. They organised a general strike, the Ulster Workers' Council strike. This severely curtailed business in Northern Ireland and cut off essential services such as water and electricity. Nationalists argue that the British Government did not do enough to break this strike and uphold the Sunningdale initiative. There is evidence that the strike was further encouraged by MI5, a part of their campaign to 'disorientate' British prime minister Harold Wilson's government[145] (see also Harold Wilson conspiracy theories). Faced with such opposition, the pro-Sunningdale unionists resigned from the power-sharing government and the new regime collapsed. Three days into the UWC strike, on 17 May 1974, two UVF teams from the Belfast and Mid-Ulster brigades[74] detonated three no-warning car bombs in Dublin's city centre during the Friday evening rush hour, resulting in 26 deaths and close to 300 injuries. Ninety minutes later, a fourth car bomb exploded in Monaghan, killing seven additional people. Nobody has ever been convicted for these attacks[57][133] and the bombings were the greatest loss of life in a single day during the Troubles.[123][146]  Even as his government deployed troops in August 1969, Wilson ordered a secret study of whether the British military could withdraw from Northern Ireland, including all 45 bases, such as the submarine school in Derry. The study concluded that the military could do so in three months, but if increased violence collapsed civil society, Britain would have to send in troops again. Without bases, to do so would be an invasion of Ireland; Wilson thus decided against a withdrawal.[147]  Wilson's cabinet discussed the more drastic step of complete British withdrawal from an independent Northern Ireland as early as February 1969, as one of various possibilities for the region including direct rule.[148] He wrote in 1971 that Britain had \"responsibility without power\" there,[149] and secretly met with the IRA that year while leader of the opposition; his government in late 1974 and early 1975 again met with the IRA to negotiate a ceasefire. During the meetings, the parties discussed complete British withdrawal.[150] Although the British government publicly stated that troops would stay as long as necessary, widespread fear from the Birmingham pub bombings and other IRA attacks in Britain itself increased support among MPs and the public for a military withdrawal.[151]  The failure of Sunningdale and the effectiveness of the UWC strike against British authority were more evidence to Wilson of his 1971 statement. They led to the serious consideration in London of independence until November 1975. Had the withdrawal occurred \u2013 which Wilson supported but others, including James Callaghan, opposed \u2013 the region would have become a separate dominion.[149][150] According to the secret plan, codenamed \"Doomsday\",[152] Britain would have had as little to do with the new \"Ulster Dominion\" as possible, with financial subsidies ending within five years. It would not have been an associated state, with Britain in control only of foreign relations, because a war between Ulster and the Republic would involve Britain.[149] The dominion would also not have been a member of the British Commonwealth.[152] The Northern Ireland Office cited the 1948 Newfoundland referendums\u00a0\u2013 in which the island voluntarily joined Canada, its larger neighbor\u00a0\u2013 as an example that divided Ireland might hopefully follow.[149]  The British negotiations with the IRA, an illegal organisation, angered the Republic's government. It did not know what was discussed but feared that the British were considering abandoning Northern Ireland. Irish Foreign Minister Garret FitzGerald discussed in a memorandum of June 1975 the possibilities of orderly withdrawal and independence, repartition of the island, or a collapse of Northern Ireland into civil war and anarchy. The memorandum preferred a negotiated independence as the best of the three \"worst case scenarios\", but concluded that the Irish government could do little.[150]  The Irish government had already failed to prevent a crowd from burning down the British Embassy in 1972. It believed that it could not enlarge the country's small army of 12,500 men without negative consequences. A civil war in Northern Ireland would cause many deaths there and severe consequences for the Republic, as the public would demand that it intervene to protect nationalists. FitzGerald warned Callaghan that the failure to intervene, despite Ireland's inability to do so, would \"threaten democratic government in the Republic\", which would jeopardise British and European security against Communist and other foreign nations.[150]  Wilson's aides had in 1969 come to a similar conclusion, telling him that removing Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom would cause violence and a military intervention by the Republic that would not allow the removal of British troops.[148] Loyalist leader Glen Barr said in 2008 that a British withdrawal would have caused civil war, as Loyalists would have expected the Republic to invade Northern Ireland.[152] Peter Ramsbotham, British Ambassador to the United States, warned of a hostile American reaction.[149]  The British so wanted to leave Northern Ireland in 1975, however, that only the catastrophic consequences of doing so prevented it.[149][failed verification] The Irish government so dreaded the consequences that FitzGerald refused to ask Britain not to withdraw\u00a0\u2013 as he feared that openly discussing the issue could permit the British to proceed\u00a0\u2013 and other members of government opposed the Irish Cabinet even discussing what FitzGerald referred to as a \"doomsday scenario\". He wrote in 2006 that \"Neither then nor since has public opinion in Ireland realised how close to disaster our whole island came during the last two years of Harold Wilson's premiership\",[150] and in 2008 said that the Republic \"was more at risk then than at any time since our formation\".[152]  In February 1974, an IRA time bomb killed 12 people on a coach on the M62 in the West Riding of Yorkshire.[153] Merlyn Rees, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, lifted the proscription against the UVF in April 1974. In December, a month after the Birmingham pub bombings killed 21 people, the IRA declared a ceasefire; this would theoretically last throughout most of the following year. The ceasefire notwithstanding, sectarian killings escalated in 1975, along with internal feuding between rival paramilitary groups. This made 1975 one of the \"bloodiest years of the conflict\".[74]  On 5 April 1975, Irish republican paramilitary members killed a UDA volunteer and four Protestant civilians in a gun and bomb attack at the Mountainview Tavern on the Shankill Road, Belfast. The attack was claimed by the Republican Action Force believed to be a covername used by Provisional IRA (IRA) volunteers.[154][155]  On 31 July 1975 at Buskhill, outside Newry, popular Irish cabaret band the Miami Showband was returning home to Dublin after a gig in Banbridge when it was ambushed by gunmen from the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade wearing British Army uniforms at a bogus military roadside checkpoint on the main A1 road. Three of the bandmembers, two Catholics and a Protestant, were shot dead, while two of the UVF men were killed when the bomb they had loaded onto the band's minibus detonated prematurely. The following January, eleven Protestant workers were gunned down in Kingsmill, South Armagh after having been ordered off their bus by an armed republican gang, which called itself the South Armagh Republican Action Force. This resulted in 10 fatalities, with one man surviving despite being shot 18 times. These killings were reportedly in retaliation to a loyalist double shooting attack against the Reavey and O'Dowd families the previous night.[57][114][133]  The violence continued through the rest of the 1970s. This included a series of attacks in Southern England in 1974 and 1975 by Provisional IRA active service unit the Balcombe Street Gang.[156] The British Government reinstated the ban against the UVF in October 1975, making it once more an illegal organisation. The Provisional IRA's December 1974 ceasefire officially ended in January 1976, although it had carried out several attacks in 1975.[157][158] The Provisional IRA had lost the hope it had felt in the early 1970s that it could force a rapid British withdrawal from Northern Ireland, and instead developed a strategy known as the \"Long War\", which involved a less intense but more sustained campaign of violence that could continue indefinitely.[159] The Official IRA ceasefire of 1972, however, became permanent, and the \"Official\" movement eventually evolved into the Workers' Party, which rejected violence completely. However, a splinter from the \"Officials\"\u00a0\u2013 the Irish National Liberation Army\u00a0\u2013 continued a campaign of violence in 1974.[133]  By the late 1970s, war-weariness was visible in both communities. One sign of this was the formation of the Peace People, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1976. The Peace People organised large demonstrations calling for an end to paramilitary violence. Their campaign lost momentum, however, after they appealed to the nationalist community to provide information on the IRA to security forces.[160]  In February 1978, the IRA bombed La Mon, a hotel restaurant in Comber, County Down.[161] The decade ended with a double attack by the IRA against the British. On 27 August 1979, Lord Mountbatten, while on holiday in Mullaghmore, County Sligo, was killed by a bomb planted on board his boat. Three other people were also killed: Lady Brabourne, the elderly mother of Mountbatten's son-in-law; and two teenagers, a grandson of Mountbatten and a local boatman.[114] That same day, eighteen British soldiers, mostly members of the Parachute Regiment, were killed by two remote-controlled bombs in the Warrenpoint ambush at Narrow Water Castle, near Warrenpoint, County Down.[74] It was the British Army's largest loss of life in a single incident in Operation Banner.[162]  Successive British Governments, having failed to achieve a political settlement, tried to \"normalise\" Northern Ireland. Aspects included the removal of internment without trial and the removal of political status for paramilitary prisoners. From 1972 onward, paramilitaries were tried in juryless Diplock courts to avoid intimidation of jurors. On conviction, they were to be treated as ordinary criminals. Resistance to this policy among republican prisoners led to more than 500 of them in the Maze prison initiating the \"blanket\" and \"dirty\" protests. Their protests culminated in hunger strikes in 1980 and 1981, aimed at the restoration of political status, as well as other concessions.[57][133]  In the 1981 Irish hunger strike, ten republican prisoners (seven from the Provisional IRA and three from the INLA) died of starvation. The first hunger striker to die, Bobby Sands, was elected to Parliament on an Anti-H-Block ticket, as was his election agent Owen Carron following Sands's death. The hunger strikes resonated among many nationalists; over 100,000 people[163] attended Sands's funeral mass in West Belfast and thousands attended those of the other hunger strikers. From an Irish republican perspective, the significance of these events was to demonstrate potential for a political and electoral strategy.[164]  In the wake of the hunger strikes, Sinn F\u00e9in, which had become the Provisional IRA's political wing,[163][165][166] began to contest elections for the first time in both Northern Ireland (as abstentionists) and in the Republic. In 1986, Sinn F\u00e9in recognised the legitimacy of the Irish D\u00e1il, which caused a small group of members to break away and form Republican Sinn F\u00e9in.[57]  The IRA's \"Long War\" was boosted by large donations of arms from Libya in the 1980s (see Provisional IRA arms importation) partly due to Muammar Gaddafi's anger at British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government for assisting the Reagan government's 1986 bombing of Libya, which had allegedly killed one of Gaddafi's children. Additionally, it received funding from supporters in the Republic of Ireland and the United States and elsewhere throughout the Irish diaspora.[167] Loyalist paramilitaries also received significant funding and arms from supporters in Canada and Scotland.[168][169]  In July 1982, the IRA bombed military ceremonies in London's Hyde Park and Regent's Park, killing four soldiers, seven bandsmen, and seven horses.[170] The INLA was highly active in the early and mid-1980s. In December 1982, it bombed a disco in Ballykelly, County Londonderry, frequented by off-duty British soldiers which killed 11 soldiers and six civilians.[114] In December 1983, the IRA attacked Harrods using a car bomb, killing six people.[171] One of the IRA's most high-profile actions in this period was the Brighton hotel bombing on 12 October 1984, when it set off a 100-pound time bomb in the Grand Brighton Hotel in Brighton, where politicians including Thatcher were staying for the Conservative Party conference. The bomb, which exploded in the early hours of the morning, killed five people, including Conservative MP Sir Anthony Berry, and injured 34 others.[172]  On 28 February 1985 in Newry, nine RUC officers were killed in a mortar attack on the police station.[173][174] It was planned by the IRA's South Armagh Brigade and an IRA unit in Newry. Nine shells were fired from a mark 10 mortar which was bolted onto the back of a hijacked Ford van in Crossmaglen. Eight shells overshot the station; the ninth hit a portable cabin which was being used as a canteen. It was the RUC's largest loss of life during the Troubles.[173] On 8 May 1987, eight IRA members attacked an RUC station in Loughgall, County Armagh, using a bomb and guns.[175] All were killed by the SAS \u2013 the most IRA members killed in a single incident in the Troubles.[175] On 8 November 1987 in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, a Provisional IRA time bomb exploded during a Remembrance Sunday ceremony for UK Commonwealth war casualties. The bomb went off near a cenotaph that was at the heart of the parade. Eleven people (ten civilians and one serving member of the RUC) were killed and 63 were injured. Former school headmaster Ronnie Hill was seriously injured in the bombing and slipped into a coma two days later, remaining in this condition for more than a decade before his death in December 2000.[176] The unit that carried out the bombing was disbanded.[when?] Loyalist paramilitaries responded to the bombing with revenge attacks on Catholics, mostly civilians.[177] Another bomb had been planted at nearby Tullyhommon at a parallel Remembrance Day commemoration but failed to detonate.[133]  In March 1988, three IRA volunteers who were planning a bombing were shot dead by the SAS at a Shell petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue in Gibraltar, the British Overseas Territory attached to the south of Spain. This became known as Operation Flavius. Their funeral at Milltown Cemetery in Belfast was attacked by Michael Stone, a UDA member who threw grenades as the coffin was lowered and shot at people who chased him. Stone killed three people, including IRA volunteer Kevin Brady. Stone was jailed for life the following year, but was freed 11 years later under the Good Friday Agreement.[178] Two British Army corporals, David Howes and Derek Wood, who were in plain clothes, drove their car into Brady's funeral cortege in Andersonstown. The crowd assumed the soldiers were loyalists intent on repeating Stone's attack; dozens of people surrounded and attacked their car. The soldiers were pulled out of their car, kidnapped and shot dead by the IRA. This became known as the Corporals killings.[57][133]  In September 1989, the IRA used a time bomb to attack the Royal Marine Depot, Deal in Kent, killing 11 bandsmen.[179]  Towards the end of the decade, the British Army tried to soften its public appearance to residents in communities such as Derry in order to improve relations between the local community and the military. Soldiers were told not to use the telescopic sights on their rifles to scan the streets, as civilians believed they were being aimed at. Soldiers were also encouraged to wear berets when manning checkpoints (and later other situations) rather than helmets, which were perceived as militaristic and hostile. The system of complaints was overhauled \u2013 if civilians believed they were being harassed or abused by soldiers in the streets or during searches and made a complaint, they would never find out what action (if any) was taken. The new regulations required an officer to visit the complainants house to inform them of the outcome of their complaint.[180]  In the 1980s, loyalist paramilitary groups, including the Ulster Volunteer Force, the Ulster Defence Association, and Ulster Resistance, imported arms and explosives from South Africa.[74] The weapons obtained were divided between the UDA, the UVF, and Ulster Resistance, although some of the weaponry (such as rocket-propelled grenades) were hardly used. In 1987, the Irish People's Liberation Organisation (IPLO), a breakaway faction of the INLA, engaged in a bloody feud against the INLA which weakened the INLA's presence in some areas. By 1992, the IPLO was destroyed by the Provisionals for its involvement in drug dealing, thus ending the feud.[57]  The IRA's South Armagh Brigade had made the countryside village of Crossmaglen their stronghold since the 1970s. The surrounding villages of Silverbridge, Cullyhanna, Cullaville, Forkhill, Jonesborough, and Creggan were also IRA strongholds. In February 1978, a British Army Gazelle helicopter was shot down near Silverbridge, killing Lieutenant Colonel Ian Corden-Lloyd.[181]  In the 1990s, the IRA came up with a new plan to restrict British Army foot patrols near Crossmaglen. They developed two sniper teams to attack British Army and RUC patrols.[182] They usually fired from an improvised armoured car using a .50 BMG calibre M82 sniper rifle. Signs were put up around South Armagh reading \"Sniper at Work\". The snipers killed a total of nine members of the security forces: seven soldiers and two constables. The last to be killed before the Good Friday Agreement was a British soldier, bombardier Steven Restorick.  The IRA had developed the capacity to attack helicopters in South Armagh and elsewhere since the 1980s,[183] including the 1990 shootdown of a Gazelle flying over the border between counties Tyrone and Monaghan by the East Tyrone Brigade; there were no fatalities in any of those incidents.[184]  Another incident involving British helicopters in South Armagh was the Battle of Newry Road in September 1993.[185] Two other helicopters, a British Army Lynx and a Royal Air Force Puma were shot down by improvised mortar fire in 1994. The IRA set up checkpoints in South Armagh during this period, which were unchallenged by the security forces.[183][186]  On 7 February 1991, the IRA attempted to assassinate prime minister John Major and his war cabinet by launching a mortar at 10 Downing Street while they were gathered there to discuss the Gulf War.[187] The mortar bombing caused only four injuries, two of which were to police officers, while Major and the entire war cabinet were unharmed.[187]  After a prolonged period of background political manoeuvring, during which the 1992 Baltic Exchange and 1993 Bishopsgate bombings occurred in London, both loyalist and republican paramilitary groups declared ceasefires in 1994. The year leading up to the ceasefires included a mass shooting in Castlerock, County Londonderry in which four people were killed. The IRA responded with the Shankill Road bombing in October 1993, which aimed to kill the UDA leadership, but instead killed eight Protestant civilian shoppers and a low-ranking UDA member, as well as one of the perpetrators, who was killed when the bomb detonated prematurely. The UDA responded with attacks in nationalist areas including a mass shooting in Greysteel, in which eight civilians were killed \u2013 six Catholics and two Protestants.[57]  On 16 June 1994, just before the ceasefires, the Irish National Liberation Army killed three UVF members in a gun attack on the Shankill Road. In revenge, three days later the UVF killed six civilians in a shooting at a pub in Loughinisland, County Down. The IRA, in the remaining month before its ceasefire, killed four senior loyalist paramilitaries, three from the UDA and one from the UVF. On 31 August 1994, the IRA declared a ceasefire. The loyalist paramilitaries, temporarily united in the \"Combined Loyalist Military Command\", reciprocated six weeks later. Although these ceasefires failed in the short run, they marked an effective end to large-scale political violence, as they paved the way for the final ceasefires.[57][133]  In 1995, the United States appointed George J. Mitchell as the United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland. Mitchell was recognised as being more than a token envoy and as representing a President (Bill Clinton) with a deep interest in events.[188] The British and Irish governments agreed that Mitchell would chair an international commission on disarmament of paramilitary groups.[189]  On 9 February 1996, less than two years after the declaration of the ceasefire, the IRA revoked it with the Docklands bombing in the Canary Wharf area of London, killing two people, injuring 39 others,[190] and causing \u00a385\u00a0million in damage to the city's financial centre. Sinn F\u00e9in blamed the failure of the ceasefire on the British Government's refusal to begin all-party negotiations until the IRA decommissioned its weapons.[191]  The attack was followed by several more, most notably the 1996 Manchester bombing, which destroyed a large area of the centre of the city on 15 June. It was the largest bomb attack in Britain since World War II. While the attack avoided any fatalities due to a telephone warning and the rapid response of the emergency services, over 200 people were injured in the attack, many of them outside the established cordon. The damage caused by the blast was estimated at \u00a3411\u00a0million. Lance bombardier Stephen Restorick, the last British soldier killed during the Troubles, was shot dead at a checkpoint on the Green Rd near Bessbrook on 12 February 1997 by the IRA's South Armagh sniper.[192]  The IRA reinstated their ceasefire in July 1997, as negotiations for the document that became known as the Good Friday Agreement began without Sinn F\u00e9in. In September of the same year, Sinn F\u00e9in signed the Mitchell Principles and were admitted to the talks. The UVF was the first paramilitary grouping to split as a result of their ceasefire, spawning the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) in 1996. In December 1997, the INLA assassinated LVF leader Billy Wright, leading to a series of revenge killings by loyalist groups. A group split from the Provisional IRA and formed the Real IRA (RIRA).[193]  In August 1998, a Real IRA bomb in Omagh killed 29 civilians, the most by a single bomb during the Troubles.[123] This bombing discredited \"dissident republicans\" and their campaigns in the eyes of many who had previously supported the Provisionals' campaign. They became small groups with little influence, but still capable of violence.[194]  The INLA also declared a ceasefire after the Good Friday Agreement. Since then, most paramilitary violence has been directed at their \"own\" communities and at other factions within their organisations. The UDA, for example, has feuded with their fellow loyalists the UVF on two occasions since 2000. There have been internal struggles for power between \"brigade commanders\" and involvement in organised crime.[195]  After the ceasefires, talks began between the main political parties in Northern Ireland to establish political agreement. These talks led to the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. This Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of \"power-sharing\". In 1999, an executive was formed consisting of the four main parties, including Sinn F\u00e9in. Other important changes included the reform of the RUC, renamed as the Police Service of Northern Ireland, which was required to recruit at least a 50% quota of Catholics for ten years, and the removal of Diplock courts under the Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007.[196]  A security normalisation process also began as part of the treaty, which comprised the progressive closing of redundant British Army barracks, border observation towers, and the withdrawal of all forces taking part in Operation Banner \u2013 including the resident battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment \u2013 that would be replaced by an infantry brigade, deployed in ten sites around Northern Ireland but with no operative role in the province.[8]  The power-sharing Executive and Assembly were suspended in 2002, when unionists withdrew following \"Stormontgate\", a controversy over allegations of an IRA spy ring operating at Stormont. There were ongoing tensions about the Provisional IRA's failure to disarm fully and sufficiently quickly. IRA decommissioning has since been completed (in September 2005) to the satisfaction of most parties.[197]  A feature of Northern Ireland politics since the Agreement has been eclipsed in electoral terms of parties such as the SDLP and Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) by rival parties such as Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP. Similarly, although political violence is greatly reduced, sectarian animosity has not disappeared. Residential areas are more segregated between Catholic nationalists and Protestant unionists than ever.[198][needs update?] Thus, progress towards restoring the power-sharing institutions was slow and tortuous. On 8 May 2007, devolved government returned to Northern Ireland. DUP leader Ian Paisley and Sinn F\u00e9in's Martin McGuinness took office as First Minister and deputy First Minister, respectively.[199]  Both Republican and Loyalist paramilitaries sought to obtain weapons outside of Northern Ireland in order to achieve their objectives. Irish Republican paramilitaries received the vast majority of external support. Over the years, the Provisional IRA imported arms from external sources such as sympathisers in the Republic of Ireland, Irish diaspora communities within the Anglosphere, mainland Europe, the Palestine Liberation Organization, and Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. The Soviet Union and North Korea supplied the Official IRA with 5,000 weapons,[200] and the INLA received considerable arms from overseas as well.  The IRA's primary external support was from the Republic of Ireland, whose safe haven allowed the group to raise legal and illegal funds, organise and train, and manufacture a large number of firearms and explosives with ease and then smuggled them into Northern Ireland and England.[201] The IRA's primary weapon in the Republic was explosives (including gelignite, fertiliser, and ANFO), which were responsible for the vast majority of the bombings in Northern Ireland and England throughout the conflict.[201] While the plastic explosive Semtex donated by Gaddafi was appreciated and infamous in IRA bombing campaigns, they were actually sparsely used. Notable events of IRA bombs of Irish origin included Bloody Friday, the Warrenpoint ambush, the assassination of Lord Mountbatten, and the Hyde Park and Regent's Park bombings.  Loyalist paramilitaries also received support, mainly from Protestant supporters in Canada, England, and Scotland (including members of the Orange Order). From 1979 to 1986, loyalist paramilitaries imported up to 100 machine guns and \"as many rifles, grenade launchers, magnum revolvers and hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition from Canada.\"[202] Members of the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland sent gelignite explosives to UDA and UVF members.[203][204][205] British Army's Force Research Unit (FRU) agent Brian Nelson also secured a large amount of weaponry from the South African government to loyalists.[206]  Irish Republican and Loyalist militants also received significant funding from groups, individuals, and state actors outside Northern Ireland. From the 1970s to the early 1990s, Libya gave the IRA over $12.5 million in cash (the equivalent of roughly $40 million in 2021).[207][208][209] The IRA also received at least $2 million from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in exchange for training them with bomb techniques, including shaped charges, propane bombs, landmines, and the construction of mortars (see also the Colombia Three).[210] On the Loyalist side, the Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee report of June 2002 stated that \"in 1992 it was estimated that Scottish support for the UDA and UVF might amount to \u00a3100,000 a year.\"[211]  In the Anglosphere outside Great Britain, Irish Americans, Irish Canadians, Irish Australians, and Irish New Zealanders provided considerable or substantial financial donations to the Republican movement, mostly the Provisionals.[212][213][214] The financial backbone of the Provisional cause in America was the Irish Northern Aid Committee (NORAID), which was estimated to have raised $3.6 million between 1970 and 1991, including for supporting families of dead or imprisoned IRA members, lobbying and propaganda efforts, and sometimes purchasing weapons for the Provisional IRA.[215][216][217][218][219][220] In Australia, officials estimated that by the 1990s, no more than A$20,000 were raised annually for the Provisionals.[221] Canadian supporters raised money to secretly purchase weapons, notably detonators used for Canadian mining sites and smuggled to the IRA.[222][223][224]   However, nearly all or the vast majority of the funding for both Republican and Loyalist paramilitaries came from criminal and business activities within the island of Ireland and Great Britain.[225][226][211][201] The Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee report of June 2002 stated that: Historically, the vast majority of paramilitary funds for both Republican and Loyalist groups have been generated within Northern Ireland. The primary reason for this is the relative ease of raising funds within these communities. Sympathy for the cause is greatest within the originating community. Those concerned also have the local knowledge which facilitates crime or the direct intimidation of individuals from whom money is sought. The fact that Northern Ireland remains predominantly a cash economy also encourages a local focus, as it facilitates money laundering and makes it difficult for the law enforcement agencies to trace transactions.[211] There were many incidents of collusion between the British state security forces (the British Army and RUC) and loyalist paramilitaries. This included soldiers and policemen taking part in loyalist attacks while off-duty, giving weapons and intelligence to loyalists, not taking action against loyalists, and hindering police investigations. The De Silva Report found that, during the 1980s, 85% of the intelligence loyalists used to target people came from the security forces,[227] who in turn also had double agents and informers within loyalist groups who organised attacks on the orders of or with the knowledge of their handlers. Of the 210 loyalists arrested by the Stevens Inquiries team, all but three were found to be state agents or informers.[228]  The British Army's locally recruited Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) was almost wholly Protestant.[229][230] Despite recruits being vetted, some loyalist militants managed to enlist, mainly to obtain weapons, training, and information.[231] A 1973 British Government document (uncovered in 2004), Subversion in the UDR, suggested that 5\u201315% of UDR soldiers then were members of loyalist paramilitaries.[231][232] The report said the UDR was the main source of weapons for those groups,[231] although by 1973, UDR weapons losses had dropped significantly, partly due to stricter controls.[231] In 1977, the Army investigated a UDR battalion based at Girdwood Barracks, Belfast. The investigation found that 70 soldiers had links to the UVF, that thirty soldiers had fraudulently diverted up to \u00a347,000 to the UVF, and that UVF members socialised with soldiers in their mess. Following this, two UDR members were dismissed.[233] The investigation was halted after a senior officer claimed it was harming morale.[233] By 1990, at least 197 UDR soldiers had been convicted of loyalist terrorist offences and other serious crimes, including 19 convicted of murder.[234] This was only a small fraction of those who served in the UDR, but the proportion was higher than the regular British Army, the RUC, and the civilian population.[235]  During the 1970s, the Glenanne gang\u00a0\u2013 a secret alliance of loyalist militants, British soldiers, and RUC officers\u00a0\u2013 carried out a string of gun and bomb attacks against nationalists in an area of Northern Ireland known as the \"murder triangle\".[236][237] It also carried out some attacks in the Republic, killing about 120 people in total, mostly uninvolved civilians.[238] The Cassel Report investigated 76 murders attributed to the group and found evidence that soldiers and policemen were involved in 74 of those.[239] One member, RUC officer John Weir, claimed his superiors knew of the collusion but allowed it to continue.[240] The Cassel Report also stated some senior officers knew of the crimes but did nothing to prevent, investigate, or punish perpetrators.[239] Attacks attributed to the group include the Dublin and Monaghan bombings (1974), the Miami Showband killings (1975), and the Reavey and O'Dowd killings (1976).[241]  The Stevens Inquiries found that elements of the security forces had used loyalists as \"proxies\"[242] who, via double-agents and informers, had helped loyalist groups to kill targeted individuals, usually suspected republicans but also civilians both intentionally and otherwise. The inquiries concluded this had intensified and prolonged the conflict.[243][244] The British Army's Force Research Unit (FRU) was the main agency involved.[242] Brian Nelson, the UDA's chief 'intelligence officer', was a FRU agent.[245] Through Nelson, FRU helped loyalists target people for assassination. FRU commanders say they helped loyalists target only suspected or known republican activists and prevented the killing of civilians.[242] The Inquiries found evidence only two lives were saved and that Nelson\/FRU was responsible for at least 30 murders and many other attacks, many on civilians.[243] One victim was solicitor Pat Finucane. Nelson also supervised the shipping of weapons to loyalists in 1988.[245] From 1992 to 1994, loyalists were responsible for more deaths than republicans,[246] partly due to FRU involvement.[247][248] Members of the security forces tried to obstruct the Stevens investigation.[244][249]  A Police Ombudsman report from 2007 revealed that UVF members had been allowed to commit a string of terrorist offences, including murder, while working as informers for RUC Special Branch. It found that Special Branch had given informers immunity by ensuring they were not caught or convicted and blocking weapons searches.[250] Ombudsman Nuala O'Loan concluded that this had led to \"hundreds\" of deaths[228] and said senior British Government officials pressured her into halting her investigation.[251] UVF member Robin Jackson has been linked to between 50[252][253] and 100[237] killings in Northern Ireland, although he was never convicted for any.[254] It is alleged by many, including members of the security forces, that Jackson was an RUC agent.[254] The Irish Government's Barron Report alleged that Jackson also \"had relationships with British Intelligence\".[255] In 2016, a new Ombudsman report concluded that there had been collusion between the police and the UVF in relation to the deaths of six Catholic men in the 1994 Loughinisland massacre and that the investigation was undermined by the wish to protect informers, but found no evidence police had foreknowledge of the attack.[256]  The Smithwick Tribunal concluded that a member of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na (the Republic of Ireland's police force) colluded with the IRA in the killing of two senior RUC officers in 1989.[257][258][259][260] The two officers were ambushed by the IRA near Jonesborough, County Armagh, when returning from a cross-border security conference in Dundalk in the Republic of Ireland.[258]  During the 1970s and 1980s, republican and loyalist paramilitaries abducted a number of individuals, many alleged to have been informers, who were then secretly killed and buried.[261] Eighteen people\u00a0\u2013 two women and sixteen men\u00a0\u2013 including one British Army officer, were kidnapped and killed during the Troubles. They are referred to informally as \"The Disappeared\". All but one, Lisa Dorrian, were abducted and killed by republicans. Dorrian is believed to have been abducted by loyalists. The remains of all but four of \"The Disappeared\" have been recovered and turned over to their families.[262][263][264]  British government security forces, including the Military Reaction Force (MRF), carried out what have been described as \"extrajudicial killings\" of unarmed civilians.[265][266][267] Their victims were often Catholic or suspected Catholic civilians unaffiliated with any paramilitaries, such as the Whiterock Road shooting of two unarmed Catholic civilians by British soldiers on 15 April 1972, and the Andersonstown shooting of seven unarmed Catholic civilians on 12 May that same year.[268] A member of the MRF stated in 1978 that the Army often attempted false flag sectarian attacks, provoking sectarian conflict and \"taking the heat off the Army\".[269] A former member stated: \"[W]e were not there to act like an army unit, we were there to act like a terror group.\"[270]  Republicans allege that the security forces operated a shoot-to-kill policy rather than arresting IRA suspects. The security forces denied this and pointed out that six of the eight IRA men killed in the Loughgall ambush in 1987 were heavily armed. On the other hand, the shooting of three unarmed IRA members in Gibraltar by the Special Air Service ten months later appeared to confirm suspicions among republicans and in the British and Irish media of a tacit British shoot-to-kill policy of suspected IRA members.[271]  Inter-communal tensions rise and violence often breaks out during the \"marching season\" when the Protestant Orange Order parades take place across Northern Ireland. The parades are held to commemorate William of Orange's victory in the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, which secured the Protestant Ascendancy and British rule in Ireland. One particular flashpoint which has caused continuous annual strife is the Garvaghy Road area in Portadown, where an Orange parade from Drumcree Church passes through a mainly nationalist estate off the Garvaghy Road. This parade has now been banned indefinitely, following nationalist riots against the parade and loyalist counter-riots against its banning.  In 1995, 1996, and 1997, there were several weeks of prolonged rioting throughout Northern Ireland over the impasse at Drumcree. A number of people died in this violence, including a Catholic taxi driver killed by the Loyalist Volunteer Force, and three (of four) nominally Catholic brothers (from a mixed-religion family) died when their house in Ballymoney was petrol-bombed.[272][273][274]  The impact of the Troubles on the ordinary people of Northern Ireland has been compared to that of the Blitz on the people of London.[275] The stress resulting from bomb attacks, street disturbances, security checkpoints, and the constant military presence had the strongest effect on children and young adults.[276] There was also the fear that local paramilitaries instilled in their respective communities with the punishment beatings, \"romperings\", and the occasional tarring and feathering meted out to individuals for various purported infractions.[277]  In addition to the violence and intimidation, there was chronic unemployment and a severe housing shortage. Many people were rendered homeless as a result of intimidation or having their houses burnt, and urban redevelopment played a role in the social upheaval. Belfast families faced being transferred to new, alien estates when older, decrepit districts such as Sailortown and the Pound Loney were being demolished. According to social worker and author Sarah Nelson, this problem of homelessness and disorientation contributed to the breakdown of the normal fabric of society, allowing for paramilitaries to exert a strong influence in certain districts.[277] Vandalism was also a major problem. In the 1970s, there were 10,000 vandalised empty houses in Belfast alone. Most of the vandals were aged between eight and thirteen.[278]  According to one historian of the conflict, the stress of the Troubles engendered a breakdown in the previously strict sexual morality of Northern Ireland, resulting in a \"confused hedonism\" in respect of personal life.[279] In Derry, illegitimate births and alcoholism increased for women and the divorce rate rose.[280] Teenage alcoholism was also a problem, partly as a result of the drinking clubs established in both loyalist and republican areas. In many cases, there was little parental supervision of children in some of the poorer districts.[281] The Department of Health has looked at a report written in 2007 by Mike Tomlinson of Queen's University, which asserted that the legacy of the Troubles has played a substantial role in the current rate of suicide in Northern Ireland.[282]  Further social issues arising from the Troubles include antisocial behavior and an aversion towards political participation. According to one historian, children raised during the Troubles were found to develop similar antisocial external behaviors as children similarly born in regions of conflict, notably those born and raised during World War II.[283] Further studies into the impact of violence on the psychological development of children in Northern Ireland also found that those raised during the Troubles were more likely to be averse towards political participation, noting that while older generations still actively associated with their own social and political groups, younger generations became wary of such groups as social and political divisions continued to expand during the thirty years of the Troubles.[284]  Peace lines, which were built in Northern Ireland during the early years of the Troubles, remain in place.[285]  According to a 2022 poll, 69% of Irish nationalists polled believe there was no option but \"violent resistance to British rule during the Troubles\".[286]  According to the Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN), 3,532 people were killed as a result of the conflict between 1969 and 2001.[287] Of these, 3,489 were killed up to 1998.[287] According to the book Lost Lives (2006 edition), 3,720 people were killed as a result of the conflict from 1966 to 2006. Of these, 3,635 were killed up to 1998.[288]  In The Politics of Antagonism: Understanding Northern Ireland, Brendan O'Leary and John McGarry point out that \"nearly two per cent of the population of Northern Ireland have been killed or injured through political violence [...] If the equivalent ratio of victims to population had been produced in Great Britain in the same period some 100,000 people would have died, and if a similar level of political violence had taken place, the number of fatalities in the USA would have been over 500,000\".[289] Using this relative comparison to the US, analyst John M. Gates suggests that whatever one calls the conflict, it was \"certainly not\" a \"low intensity conflict\".[290]  In 2010, it was estimated that 107,000 people in Northern Ireland suffered some physical injury as a result of the conflict. On the basis of data gathered by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, the Victims Commission estimated that the conflict resulted in 500,000 'victims' in Northern Ireland alone. It defines 'victims' are those who are directly affected by 'bereavement', 'physical injury', or 'trauma' as a result of the conflict.[291]  Republican paramilitaries were responsible for some 60% of all deaths, loyalists 30% and British security forces 10%.[39]  Loyalists killed 48% of the civilian casualties, republicans killed 39%, and the British security forces killed 10%.[292] Most of the Catholic civilians were killed by loyalists, and most of the Protestant civilians were killed by republicans.[293]  Of those killed by republican paramilitaries:[294]  Of those killed by loyalist paramilitaries:[294]  Of those killed by British security forces:[294]  Approximately 52% of the dead were civilians, 32% were members or former members of the British security forces, 11% were members of republican paramilitaries, and 5% were members of loyalist paramilitaries.[39] About 60% of the civilian casualties were Catholics, 30% of the civilians were Protestants, and the rest were from outside Northern Ireland.[295]  About 257 of those killed were children under the age of seventeen, representing 7.2% of the total,[296] while 274 children under the age of eighteen were killed during the conflict.[297]  It has been the subject of dispute whether some individuals were members of paramilitary organisations. Several casualties that were listed as civilians were later claimed by the IRA as their members.[298] One Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and three Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) members killed during the conflict were also Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) soldiers at the time of their deaths.[299] At least one civilian victim was an off-duty member of the Territorial Army.[300]  Most killings took place within Northern Ireland, especially in Belfast and County Armagh. Most of the killings in Belfast took place in the west and north of the city. Dublin, London and Birmingham were also affected, albeit to a lesser degree than Northern Ireland itself. Occasionally, the IRA attempted or carried out attacks on British targets in Gibraltar, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.[301][302]   Category "},{"title":"Danish Football Association","content":"The Danish Football Union (Danish: Dansk Boldspil-Union; abbr. DBU) is the governing body of football in Denmark. It is the organization of Danish football clubs and runs the professional Danish football leagues, alongside the men's and women's national teams. Based in the city of Br\u00f8ndby, it is a founding member of both FIFA and UEFA. The DBU has also been the governing body of futsal in Denmark since 2008.  The DBU was founded on 18 May 1889 and was the first national football association outside Great Britain and Ireland.[1] However, it did not register games officially before the 1908 Summer Olympics, meaning that the win in the 1906 Intercalated Olympics tournament was not officially recorded by the DBU.  The following is a list of presidents since its creation in 1905.[2]  The DBU is separated into six regional associations, based on the former counties of Denmark:  The Faroe Islands and Greenland, which are autonomous territories within Denmark, have their own football associations and are not part of the DBU. Greenland is not a member of FIFA or any continental federation, but the Faroe Islands are a member of both FIFA and UEFA.  The Denmark national football teams represents Denmark in international football competitions and is controlled by the DBU. As of June 2021[update],[3] the teams consist of:  The DBU awards the best national team players each year, with an award to the best senior team player, as well as the best player in three of the DBU's six national youth teams.  Since 1963, the DBU has awarded the Danish Player of the Year in a vote amongst the Danish players. In the time of amateur football, only players in the domestic league could achieve the prize, and even after the emergence of paid football in 1978, no players in foreign clubs were eligible for the award. When the award was finally opened to all Danish players, domestic and abroad, in 1983, national team captain Morten Olsen was the first player to win the Player of the Year award taking all Danish players into consideration. The record number of award wins is four, by Brian Laudrup (1989, 1992, 1995, and 1997).  The Young Players of the Year Awards on the other hand are sponsored by Arla Foods, the awards were initially known as M\u00e6lkens talentpriser (the Milk Talent Awards) in order to promote the line of dairy products of the company then known as MD Foods. DBU found new sponsor DONG (later DONG Energy), an oil company, in 2004 but Arla went on to sponsor the prize which was renamed Arla's talentpriser (the Arla Talent Awards) in 2005.[4][5][6]  In 2017, the negotiations regarding terms and salary with the women's national team broke down, causing DBU to cancel the world cup qualification match against Sweden. The team lost the match 3\u20130 due to forfeit. DBU was handed a fine by the UEFA disciplinary committee. The national team and DBU came to an agreement before the match was supposed to be played, but the match was already cancelled. The team then failed to qualify directly to the world cup. A playoff match will decide if the team will qualify to the world cup.  After the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the agreement between DBU and the men's national team expired. The negotiations about terms and salary are still ongoing. Currently DBU has selected a squad without any players from the top tier of international and national leagues. The team is to play two matches. DBU refuses to negotiate before the end of the two matches.  The badge is still in use on the Danish men's kit for the European Championship 2020 (so-named despite being played in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic). "},{"title":"United States Soccer Federation","content":"  The United States Soccer Federation (USSF), commonly referred to as U.S. Soccer, is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization and the official governing body of the sport of soccer in the United States. Headquartered in Chicago, the federation is a full member of FIFA and governs American soccer at the international, professional, and amateur levels, including: the men's and women's national teams, Major League Soccer, National Women's Soccer League, youth organizations, beach soccer, futsal, Paralympic, and deaf national teams. U.S. Soccer sanctions referees and soccer tournaments for most soccer leagues in the United States. The U.S. Soccer Federation also administers and operates the U.S. Open Cup and the SheBelieves Cup.  U.S. Soccer was originally known as the United States Football Association. It formed on April 5, 1913, at the Astor House Hotel in Lower Manhattan,[3] and on August 15 of that year was accepted as one of the earliest member organizations of FIFA and the first from North and Central America. The affiliation was originally provisional[4] but during FIFA Congress in Oslo, Norway on June 24, 1914, the USFA, as it was abbreviated at the time, was accepted as a full FIFA member.[5] The governing body of the sport in the United States added the word soccer to its name in 1945, when it became the United States Soccer Football Association; by this point, football as a standalone word had come to define a totally different sport in the U.S. It dropped the word football from its name in 1974 to become known as the United States Soccer Federation.[6]  U.S. Soccer has hosted several global soccer tournaments, including the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the 1999 and 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup, and the Summer Olympic football tournaments in 1984 and 1996.  Originally based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, U.S. Soccer headquarters were moved to Chicago in 1991 under the leadership of former Secretary General, Hank Steinbrecher[7][8] Called U.S. Soccer House, it is currently located in two refurbished mansions at 1801 South Prairie Avenue in Chicago.[9]  In 2003, U.S. Soccer opened their National Training Center at Dignity Health Sports Park (then named Home Depot Center) in Carson, California. The $130\u00a0million facility includes a soccer-specific stadium, home to the MLS team Los Angeles Galaxy. Additionally, four grass soccer fields, a FieldTurf soccer field and a general training area are specifically dedicated to U.S. Soccer. Both the senior and youth men's and women's U.S. national teams hold regular camps at Dignity Health Sports Park.[10]  U.S. Soccer was also exploring a possibility of building the National Training and Coaching Development Center in Kansas City, Kansas.[11] On April 9, 2015, the Development Center received final approval from the local governments. U.S. Soccer agreed to a 20-year lease, with the project set to break ground in 2016 and finishing some time in 2017.[12][13]  In September 2023, U.S. Soccer announced they were moving from Chicago to a new headquarters and training center near Atlanta, which will be partially funded by Arthur Blank, cofounder of The Home Depot and owner of the NFL\u2019s Atlanta Falcons and the MLS\u2019s Atlanta United.[14] In December 2023, U.S. Soccer announced they had chosen a site for the new national training center in Fayette County, Georgia. The 200-acre (81\u00a0ha) site is scheduled to be developed and opened prior to the 2026 FIFA World Cup; it is near the headquarters of Coca-Cola, one of the founding partners for the training center.[15]  U.S. Soccer is governed by a board of directors that administers the affairs of U.S. Soccer.[16] Cindy Parlow Cone, former 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup champion and long-time U.S. Soccer administrator, became president in March 2020 following the resignation of Carlos Cordeiro.[17] JT Batson was named chief executive officer and secretary general in September 2022.[18]  U.S. Soccer members are individuals and affiliate organizations. The national council is the representative membership body of the federation. It elects the president and vice president, amends the bylaws, approves the budgets, decides on policies adopted by the board, and affirms actions of the Board.[citation needed] The non-profit organization is a member of the worldwide soccer body FIFA and the North American soccer body CONCACAF, and also has a relationship with the U.S. Olympic Committee and the International Olympic Committee.[19]  The federation convenes an annual meeting, usually held in February. Every four years, the annual meeting's attendees hold an election for the federation's president and vice president.[20]  USSF recognizes the following members:[21]  The United States men's national team was assembled in 1885 to play Canada in the first international match held outside the United Kingdom.[22] The team was invited to the inaugural FIFA World Cup in 1930 and qualified for the World Cup in 1934, finishing third place (semifinals) in 1930 out of 13 teams participating. In 1950 the United States scored one of its most surprising victories with a 1\u20130 win over heavily favored England, who were amongst the world's best sides at the time. The United States did not reach another World Cup until an upstart team qualified for the 1990 World Cup with the \"goal heard around the world\" scored by Paul Caligiuri against Trinidad and Tobago, which started the modern era of soccer in the United States.  The United States hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup, setting total and average attendance records that still stand, including drawing 94,194 fans to the final.[23] The United States made a surprising run to the second round in 1994, but finished last among the 32 teams in the 1998 World Cup. The tournament was marred by poor team chemistry and leadership, which led head coach Steve Sampson to resign.[24] Sampson was replaced by Bruce Arena, a two-time MLS Cup winner with D.C. United, in 1998.[25] Arena led a mix of veterans and youth players to a quarterfinal appearance in the 2002 World Cup, defeating rivals Mexico in the Round of 16 before losing to eventual runners-up Germany.[26][27]  At the 2006 edition of the tournament, the U.S. failed to qualify for a knockout round with two losses and a draw in the group stage.[28] Arena's contract was not renewed following the tournament; former assistant Bob Bradley was hired as head coach in 2007.[29] The U.S. qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa by winning the CONCACAF qualifying tournament.[30] At the World Cup, the Americans were undefeated in the group stage but were eliminated in the round of 16 by a loss to Ghana. Bradley was dismissed following the 2011 Gold Cup, which the United States lost 4\u20132 to Mexico in the final.[31]  The U.S. entered the 2014 FIFA World Cup under J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann, who had led Germany to third place in the 2006 World Cup and had lived in the United States for several years. Klinsmann recruited dual national players, particularly Germans with American heritage, and favored youth in his rosters; this included his exclusion of Landon Donovan from the World Cup roster.[32] The U.S. finished second in the \"Group of Death\" (eventual champion Germany, Ghana, and Portugal) and advanced to the round of 16, where they lost to Belgium in extra time after goalkeeper Tim Howard's 16 saves set a World Cup record.[32][33] Klinsmann was retained as head coach for the 2018 World Cup qualifying cycle, but was fired in November 2016 after the team had lost the opening two matches of the final qualifying round.[34] Bruce Arena was hired to replace Klinsmann, but the United States finished fifth and were unable to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. It was the first time the U.S. had failed to qualify for the World Cup since 1986.[35]  Arena resigned following the qualification campaign and was replaced by Dave Sarachan, who was interim coach during the search for a permanent head coach. Sarachan's year-long tenure included the introduction of several young players to replace veterans who had resigned following the 2018 qualification cycle.[36] Columbus Crew coach Gregg Berhalter was selected and hired as head coach in December 2018; his rosters rely mostly on younger players who had played in MLS academies or were developed by teams in Europe. During qualification for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the United States had rosters with an average age of under 24 years old; the team finished 7\u20133\u20134 during the final round and qualified for the World Cup.[37] Berhalter used the second-youngest roster at the World Cup with only DeAndre Yedlin retained from a previous World Cup team. The United States finished second in their group with a win against Iran and ties with England and Wales. The team were eliminated in the round of 16 by the Netherlands.[38]  Berhalter's contract was renewed in June 2023 following an investigation by U.S. Soccer into allegations of domestic abuse from a 1991 incident. During his absence from the team, two assistant coaches served as interim coaches.[39][40] B.J. Callaghan, the second interim coach, led the United States to a second CONCACAF Nations League title but failed to reach the final of the 2023 CONCACAF Gold Cup.[41][42]  The United States will co-host the 2026 FIFA World Cup alongside Canada and Mexico after their joint bid was selected over Morocco by FIFA in 2018. The tournament will be the first World Cup to feature 48 teams.[43] The United States will also host the 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica, the championship of South American teams; it will be the second Copa Am\u00e9rica to be played in the United States following the Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario in 2016.[44] The United States did not automatically qualify as hosts,[45] but earned a spot through their performance in the 2023\u201324 CONCACAF Nations League.[44]  Having won four FIFA Women's World Cup tournaments\u20141991, 1999, 2015, and 2019\u2014the United States is considered the most successful in international women's soccer. The team finished second in 2011 and third in 1995, 2003, and 2007. It has won Olympic gold medals at the 1996, 2004, 2008, and 2012 Summer Olympics.[46] In addition, it has won ten titles at the Algarve Cup and nine at the CONCACAF Women's Championship, the qualifying tournament for the FIFA Women's World Cup.[47][48][49]  The inaugural FIFA Women's World Cup was held in 1991 in China. The U.S. women's national team was the first team to win the prize after beating Norway in the final.[50]  In 1999, the United States hosted the FIFA Women's World Cup for the first time. During their tournament run, the women's national team established a new level of popularity for the women's game, culminating in a final against China that drew 90,185 fans, an all-time attendance record for a women's sports event, to a sold-out Rose Bowl. After neither team scored in regulation or extra time, the final went to a penalty shootout, which the United States won 5\u20134. The celebration by Brandi Chastain after she converted the winning penalty, in which she took off her shirt, is one of the more famous images in U.S. women's sports.  U.S. Soccer Federation oversees and promotes the development of 14 youth national teams:[51]  U.S. Soccer Federation had ceased operations on its youth national team programming with the exception of the U-23, U-20, and U-17 teams on the men's side and the U-20 and U-17 teams on the women's side due to the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020.[52][53]  As of March 2023, U.S. Soccer Federation supervises nine extended national teams across the disciplines of beach soccer, CP soccer, deaf soccer, futsal, and power soccer.[54]  Men's coaches    Women's coaches    Extended teams' coaches    Technical staff    Referee programs staff  Referee development staff  Despite the growth of men's and women's professional soccer in the United States in the last few decades, by far the largest category of soccer in the United States, at least in terms of participation, is youth soccer.[citation needed] Though organized locally by organizations all over the United States, there are two main youth soccer organizations working nationwide through affiliated local associations. The United States Youth Soccer Association boasts over three million players between the ages of five and 19, while American Youth Soccer Organization has more than 300,000 players between the ages of four and 19. This makes soccer one of the most played sports by children in the United States.[79]  The professional first-division league in North America is Major League Soccer, which as of the 2023 season has 26 teams in the U.S. and 3 in Canada. The league began an aggressive expansion in 2017, with the goal of adding at least eight clubs. That effort has resulted in the addition of the following nine clubs: Atlanta United FC (2017), Minnesota United FC (2017), Los Angeles FC (2018), FC Cincinnati (2019), Inter Miami CF (2020), Nashville SC (2020), Austin FC (2021), Charlotte FC (2022), and St. Louis City SC (2023). The league operates as a single-entity league, which means MLS, and not the individual teams, holds the contracts on players.[80]  The one sanctioned second-division men's outdoor soccer league is the USL Championship (USLC). Previously, the second North American Soccer League had second-division status, sharing it with the USL in the 2017 season, but the NASL was denied second-division sanctioning for 2018 due to considerable instability in the league;[81] the league effectively folded at that time.  The USLC was sanctioned as the United States' lone Division II men's outdoor soccer league in 2018. Formed in 2010 as a result of the merger of the former USL First Division and USL Second Division, the USL Championship was sanctioned as Division III league from 2011 to 2016 before becoming provisionally sanctioned as a Division II league for 2017,[82] and receiving full Division II sanctioning in 2018.[83]  The USL Championship has expanded almost three-fold since its first season in 2011 to include 35 teams in the 2020 season, with the league divided into two conferences, Eastern and Western. The USLC is the world's largest Division II professional league by number of teams. Since 2014, valuation of USL Championship clubs have increased five-fold. In revenue, 2018 Championship clubs saw a 28% increase over 2017 numbers on an average of ticketing, sponsorship, merchandise, and ancillary revenue generation.[citation needed]  The USLC also holds a broadcast agreement with ESPN that sees 20 regular season games televised nationally on ESPN2, ESPNews and ESPN Deportes[84] in addition to national broadcast of the USL Championship Final, which in 2019 was aired on both ESPN2 and ESPN Deportes. The league's remaining regular season games are broadcast nationally on ESPN+, with 22 of the Championship's clubs also holding local broadcast agreements. The USL Championship's broadcast agreement was made possible in large part by a major investment by USL with league technology partner Vista Worldlink[85] to establish a USL Broadcast Center out of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.[86]  The second NASL had no official tie to the former NASL that operated from 1968 to 1984, although some of the teams shared names with their historic counterparts. Unlike MLS that is a single-entity operation, the second NASL, like the old NASL, had no salary cap and players were contracted by the individual teams.[87] The season was a split format (similar to that of many leagues in Latin America) that features seven teams, including one Puerto Rican team. Previous to the reorganization of the NASL in 2009, the USL First Division operated as the professional second-division league in the United States. However, a dispute among its teams and ownership led to the creation of the NASL which applied for and was awarded by USSF second division status. The 2010 season was played as a combined USL\/NASL league format before NASL officially separated in 2011.[88]  USL League One is sanctioned at the Men's Division III level. In March 2017, United Soccer League, administrator of the USL Championship and USL League Two, announced following the successful sanctioning of the USL Championship as a Division II league it would start a new tier in its professional structure, which became USL League One, and seek Division III certification for the 2019 season.[89] The league received sanctioning in December 2018 and conducted a successful first season in 2019 that saw 10 teams compete in a single-table format and North Texas SC claim its inaugural league title. The seven independent clubs averaged 2,496 fans per match in 2019, placing League One in the top three of Division III leagues globally, and the league has expanded to include 12 teams for its second season in 2020, with further expansion expected prior to the 2021 season.  National Independent Soccer Association (NISA) led by former Chicago Fire general manager Peter Wilt plans on fielding 8\u201310 teams in 2018 and has stated that it will seek third-division certification.[90]  A fourth-division league in the United States is the USL League Two, which as of 2015 is expected to have 58 U.S. teams, and six Canadian teams. Though League Two does have some paid players, it also has many teams that are made up entirely or almost entirely of college soccer players who use the league as an opportunity to play competitive soccer in front of professional scouts during the summer, while retaining amateur status and NCAA eligibility. Other fourth-division leagues in the United States are the United Premier Soccer League, National Premier Soccer League and Ligas Unidas.[citation needed]  In addition to MLS and the USL, the United States Adult Soccer Association governs amateur soccer competition for adults throughout the United States, which is effectively the amateur fifth-division of soccer in the United States. The USASA sanctions regional tournaments that allow entry into the U.S. Open Cup, the oldest continuous national soccer competition in the United States. Since 1914, the competition has been open to all U.S. Soccer affiliated clubs, and currently pits teams from all five levels of the American soccer pyramid against each other each year, similarly to England's FA Cup.[91]  The National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) is the professional, top-division league in North America and as of 2020, is composed of nine teams based in the U.S.[92] The league has announced expansion plans for Racing Louisville FC in 2021[93] and Los Angeles' Angel City FC in 2022.[94] Two professional, top-division leagues preceded the NWSL: the Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA), which featured many players from the 1999 FIFA Women's Cup-winning team (as well as other national teams), ran from 2001 to 2003 and Women's Professional Soccer (WPS) ran from 2009 to 2011.[95]  Two second-division leagues currently exist: United Women's Soccer began play in May 2016 and as of 2020 features 30 teams in five conferences[96] and the Women's Premier Soccer League (WPSL), started in 1997, features over 115 teams across the United States and Canada (the largest women's soccer league in the world as of 2020).[97] Previously, the USL W-League was a semi-professional league that ran from 1995 to 2015 and featured a mix of college students and international players.[98]  On November 21, 2012, U.S. Soccer, in conjunction with the Canadian Soccer Association (CSA) and Mexican Football Federation (FMF), announced the formation of a new professional league for the 2013 season.[99] The league, unnamed at the time of the initial announcement but later unveiled as the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), launched in April 2013 with eight teams.[99] Like WUSA and WPS, NWSL teams are privately owned with some owned by existing MLS teams.[100] The American and Canadian federations pay the salaries for many of their respective national team members. U.S. Soccer initially committed to funding up to 24 national team members, with the CSA committing to paying 16 players and FMF pledging support for at least 12 and possibly as many as 16.[100][101] In addition, U.S. Soccer housed the league's front office for the first four years, and scheduled matches to avoid any possible conflict with international tournaments.[100] Four of the league's charter teams had WPS ties\u2014the Boston Breakers, Chicago Red Stars, Sky Blue FC, and the Western New York Flash. The other four initial teams were located in the Kansas City, Portland, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. markets with the Portland team run by the Portland Timbers of MLS.[100] The NWSL expanded to nine teams for 2014 by adding the Houston Dash, run by the Houston Dynamo of MLS. In 2016, it expanded to 10 with the addition of another MLS-backed team, the Orlando Pride. Ahead of the 2017 season, A&E Networks announced it had taken an equity stake in the league and Lifetime would begin broadcasting games to a national television audience.[102] As of 2017[update], additional expansion teams were being discussed by Los Angeles FC, Vancouver Whitecaps FC, and FC Barcelona,[103][104][105] but none of these have yet materialized.  Several league changes occurred in advance of the 2017 season. First, FMF and U.S. Soccer amicably ended their partnership following FMF's establishment of its own women's professional league, Liga MX Femenil. The Western New York Flash ceased fully professional operations (though retaining its youth and, for a time, semi-pro operations), selling its NWSL franchise rights to Steve Malik, owner of then-NASL and current USLC side North Carolina FC. Malik relocated the NWSL team to NCFC's home of the Research Triangle and rebranded it as the North Carolina Courage. Both the Boston Breakers and FC Kansas City folded, with FCKC's player contracts transferred to Utah Royals FC, a new side owned and operated by Real Salt Lake.  The Seattle franchise went through two major changes in subsequent years. First, the team moved from Seattle to Tacoma and rebranded as Reign FC before the 2019 season. Then, in January 2020, the team was purchased by the parent company of French Ligue 1 power Olympique Lyonnais and rebranded again as OL Reign.  The league's next expansion was announced in November 2019, with a Louisville franchise granted to the ownership group of USLC side Louisville City FC, The Louisville side, which began play as Racing Louisville FC in 2021, is the first NWSL team whose entry into the league was announced more than 5 months before it started play.  The second professional league, Women's Professional Soccer (WPS), was founded in 2009. The inaugural season champion was Sky Blue FC, based in the New York\u2013New Jersey area. The team defeated the Los Angeles Sol 1\u20130 at The Home Depot Center in Carson, California. The WPS launched with seven teams, all based in the United States. The Sol folded after the league's inaugural season, and two new teams joined for 2010, bringing WPS to eight teams. However, the 2010 season saw considerable instability, with another charter team, Saint Louis Athletica, folding during the season, champions FC Gold Pride folding after the season, and the Chicago Red Stars deciding to regroup in the second-tier Women's Premier Soccer League (WPSL). The 2011 season, in which six teams based along the East Coast played, was marked by low attendance for most of the season and conflict with Dan Borislow, who had purchased the former Washington Freedom, moved the team to South Florida, and renamed it magicJack. The dispute between WPS and Borislow led the league to suspend the magicJack franchise, with Borislow responding by suing. The legal battle led WPS to suspend its 2012 season, with hopes of returning in 2013, but WPS soon decided to fold completely.  The Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA) was founded in 2001.  Headlined by the stars of the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup-winning team, $30\u00a0million was initially invested by numerous cable TV networks and owners.[106] The league's inaugural match was held between the Washington Freedom featuring Mia Hamm and the Bay Area CyberRays (featuring Brandi Chastain) at RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C. In addition to the 34,148 fans in attendance being greater than any MLS game that weekend, the Turner Network Television (TNT) broadcast reached 393,087 households: more than two MLS games broadcast on ESPN and ESPN2.[107] The league folded in 2003.  United Women's Soccer (UWS) began play in May 2016 and as of 2020 features 30 teams in five conferences across the United States.[96]  Women's Premier Soccer League (WPSL), started in 1997, features over 115 teams across the United States and Canada (the largest women's soccer league in the world as of 2020).[97]  The USL W-League was a semi-professional league that ran from 1995 to 2015 and featured a mix of college students and international players.[98] A second pre-professional league named the USL W League began play in May 2022 with 44 teams organized into seven regional divisions.[108]  USL also plans to launch a professional league, the USL Super League, in 2024 with an application for first-division sanctioning.[109]  In 2014, parents and former players filed a class action lawsuit against the United States Soccer Federation, FIFA, and other soccer organizations for failure to create policies that would prevent, evaluate and manage concussion injuries.[110] Soccer is second only to American football in the number of concussion injuries per year.[111]  The USSF has been accused by representatives of the North American Soccer League, among others, of unfairly protecting MLS's leading role in American professional soccer. Among their concerns is that the USSF benefits from financial dealings with MLS that it does not have with other leagues, giving it an apparent incentive to protect MLS from competition.[112] This includes the contract that the USSF has with MLS's Soccer United Marketing (SUM) subsidiary in which most USSF sponsorship, television licensing and royalty revenues (outside of its apparel deal with Nike, Inc.) are paid through SUM. The USSF reported $15,433,754 in revenues through the SUM relationship in its 2014 audited financial report.[113]  In 2015, the NASL took issue with proposed USSF rule changes reportedly making it harder to gain co-equal \"Division 1\" status with MLS that would increase the NASL's influence within the USSF as well as presumably allow more access to international competition and larger media and sponsorship contracts, calling the draft proposal \"...an anti-competitive bait and switch, with the purpose of entrenching MLS's monopoly position at the very time when the NASL is threatening to become a significant competitor.\"[114] Seats on the USSF's Professional Council governing committee are also based proportionally on pyramid level, giving MLS more votes when choosing the two professional league representatives on the USSF's board of directors. In 2015, those representatives are MLS Commissioner Don Garber and Alec Papadakis, CEO of the United Soccer League that announced an affiliation with MLS in 2015.  High-profile international soccer figures including former USMNT Head Coach J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann,[115] former LA Galaxy head coach and USMNT Head Coach Bruce Arena[116] and Manchester City coach and former FIFA World Coach of the Year Pep Guardiola,[117] have expressed beliefs that the top-down structure of soccer developed and managed by the USSF in the United States, including pressure to have the best American players in MLS rather than higher-quality leagues in other countries, is hampering the nation's competitiveness in international soccer.  Conversely, Klinsmann has been criticized in turn by MLS representatives for recommending that American players leave MLS development systems to pursue professional careers in Europe in order to test themselves against higher levels of players in preparation for international competition. In 2015, MLS Commissioner Don Garber said, \"I do believe our national team coach has a short-term objective. That's what he's hired to do. That doesn't mean next week, but it's to win the Gold Cup, it's to have the best possible team in 2018. And our goals and objectives are broader than that, and that's why we agree on some things but don't agree on others.\"[118]  On March 8, 2019, all members of the U.S. women's national team collectively filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against the U.S. Soccer Federation in a district court in Los Angeles. The lawsuit was filed due to claims that the athletes were being treated differently on the basis of gender, affecting their paychecks, the facilities they were offered, and even the medical treatment they received.[119] Women on the team have previously filed complaints about pay disparity, including in 2016 when five members of the women's team filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.[120][121]  On May 1, 2020, the district court dismissed the team's unequal and discriminatory pay claim, however preserving the players' claims about unequal treatment in areas like travel, hotel accommodations and team staffing. A trial on those issues is scheduled to begin June 16.[122]  Judge R. Gary Klausner of the United States District Court for the Central District of California, granted the federation's motion for summary judgment. In his ruling, he dismissed the players' arguments that they were systematically underpaid by U.S. Soccer in comparison with the men's national team. According to Klausner, U.S. Soccer had substantiated its argument that the women's team had actually earned more \"on both a cumulative and an average per-game basis\" than the men's team during the years at issue in the lawsuit.[123]  On February 22, 2022, the U.S. Soccer Federation agreed settle the lawsuit for $24 million, with a proposed $22 million going the players in the case and an additional $2 million to benefit USWNT players post-career goals and also charitable efforts related to women's soccer. The settlement also requires both male and female soccer players to paid equally for friendlies, and tournaments including the World Cup.[124][125]   In July 2023, 103 current and former U.S. Soccer senior men's and women's teams and youth squad players wrote in a letter to members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives that \"SafeSport is failing in what it was meant to achieve.\"[126][127] For one thing, they wrote that SafeSport's use of administrative closures and exclusive jurisdiction was leaving athletes vulnerable to abuse or revictimizing them.[127] They opined that: \"SafeSport should be expected to properly investigate claims and be held accountable for taking action based on those investigations.\"[127] They also took to task SafeSport's appeals process, which uses \"merits arbitration\" instead of a simple re-examination of the case for errors.[127][128] They wrote:  The arbitration process can be damaging and retraumatizing for victims of abuse who have already participated in the process and shared their stories in full, only to have to do it all over again. If the victim decides not to go through the whole process again on appeal, the decision is automatically overturned, and the perpetrator is free to enter back into the sport. The appeals process harms victims in other ways, including by affording alleged perpetrators rights that victims do not have. Victims cannot appeal a decision that finds their alleged abuser was not culpable. And SafeSport does not turn over records to the victim so that they can be sure that justice was done.[127] On July 17, 2012, in the wake of announced anti-corruption reforms by Sepp Blatter, the president of the world soccer governing body FIFA,[129] the organization appointed U.S. lawyer Michael J. Garcia as the chairman of the investigative chamber of FIFA Ethics Committee, while German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert was appointed as the chairman of the Ethics Committee's adjudication chamber.[130]  In August 2012, Garcia declared his intention to investigate the bidding process and decision to respectively award the right to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup to Russia and Qatar by the FIFA Executive Committee.[131] Garcia delivered his subsequent 350-page report in September 2014, and Eckert then announced that it would not be made public for legal reasons.[132]  On November 13, 2014, Eckert released a 42-page summary of his findings after reviewing Garcia's report. The summary cleared both Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing during the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups,[133] leaving Russia and Qatar free to stage their respective World Cups.[134]  FIFA welcomed \"the fact that a degree of closure has been reached,\" while the Associated Press wrote that the Eckert summary \"was denounced by critics as a whitewash.\"[134] Hours after the Eckert summary was released, Garcia himself criticized it for being \"materially incomplete\" with \"erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions,\" while declaring his intention to appeal to FIFA's Appeal Committee.[133] On December 16, 2014, FIFA's Appeal Committee dismissed Garcia's appeal against the Eckert summary as \"not admissible.\" FIFA also stated that Eckert's summary was \"neither legally binding nor appealable.\"[135] A day later, Garcia resigned from his role as FIFA ethics investigator in protest of FIFA's conduct, citing a \"lack of leadership\" and lost confidence in the independence of Eckert from FIFA.[136]  In June 2015, Swiss authorities claimed the report was of \"little value\".[137]  On October 3, 2022, the U.S. Soccer Federation publicly released the 173-page Yates Report, officially titled Report of the Independent Investigation to the U.S. Soccer Federation Concerning Allegations of Abusive Behavior and Sexual Misconduct in Women's Professional Soccer, the official report documenting the findings and conclusions concerning abusive behavior and sexual misconduct in women's professional soccer. The report is named for Sally Yates, the lawyer who led the investigation, a former Acting United States Attorney General.[138]  As of March\u00a08, 2024[update][139]  Chris Ahrens (paralympian national team player) Nelson Akwari (former MLS and USL player)[142] Sean Boyle (paralympian national team player) Lori Lindsey (former national team, WPS, and NWSL player; current NWSL, MLS, USL broadcast analyst)[143] Danielle Slaton (former national team, WPS, and NWSL player) Whitney Engen (former national team and NWSL player) Cassidy Leake  Jessica Berman (NWSL Commissioner) Don Garber (MLS Commissioner and CEO of Soccer United Marketing)[144] Amanda Vandervort (President of USL Super League)[145]  Fritz Marth(Vice President of United States Adult Soccer Association) John Motta(President of the United States Adult Soccer Association)  Mike Cullina(CEO\/Executive Director of US Club Soccer) Michael Karon(National President of American Youth Soccer Organization) Todd Lockhart Pete Zopfi (trauma surgeon and chair of the board United States Youth Soccer Association)[146]  Lisa Carnoy (banking executive)[147] Patti Hart (former gaming executive and Yahoo board member) Juan Uro (former NBA executive)[148]  United States Soccer Football Association (until 1974)  United States Soccer Federation (1974\u2013present)  41\u00b051\u203228\u2033N 87\u00b037\u203214\u2033W\ufeff \/ \ufeff41.8578\u00b0N 87.6205\u00b0W\ufeff \/ 41.8578; -87.6205 "},{"title":"Blackheath F.C.","content":"51\u00b027\u203229\u2033N 0\u00b002\u203246\u2033E\ufeff \/ \ufeff51.458\u00b0N 0.046\u00b0E\ufeff \/ 51.458; 0.046  Blackheath Football Club is a rugby union club based in Well Hall, Eltham in south-east London.  The club was founded in Blackheath in 1858, and is the fourth-oldest rugby club in continuous existence in the world, after Dublin University Football Club (1854), Liverpool St Helens F.C. (1857) and Edinburgh Academical Football Club (1857). The Blackheath club also assisted in organising the world's first rugby international (between England and Scotland in Edinburgh on 27 March 1871) and hosted the first international between England and Wales ten years later \u2013 the players meeting and getting changed at the Princess of Wales public house. Blackheath, along with Civil Service F.C., is one of the two clubs that can claim to be a founder member of both The Football Association and the Rugby Football Union.  The club currently play in National League 1, the third tier of the English rugby union system, with matches played at Well Hall, after a move from Rectory Field in Blackheath at the end of the 2015\u201316 season.  The institution was founded as \"Blackheath Football Club\" in 1858 by old boys of Blackheath Proprietary School who played a \"carrying\" game of football made popular by Rugby School. When the old boys played against the current pupils, supporters would shout for either \"Club\" or \"School\" accordingly. This is why to this day supporters of BFC shout for \"Club\", not for \"Blackheath\". In 1863 the club developed the tactic of passing the ball from player to player as an alternative to the solo break and the \"kick and follow-up\".  Blackheath is the fourth-oldest rugby club in continuous existence in the world, after Dublin University Football Club (1854), Liverpool St Helens F.C. (1857) and Edinburgh Academical Football Club (1857), but asserts it is the \"oldest independent Rugby club, meaning that it was not attached to any institution such as a military establishment, hospital, school or college.\"[1]  In 1863 Blackheath was a founder member of The Football Association which was formed at the Freemasons' Tavern, Great Queen Street, on Lincoln Inn Fields, London 26 October 1863 with the intention to frame a code of laws that would embrace the best and most acceptable points of all the various methods of play under the one heading of \"football\". Francis Maule Campbell, a member of Blackheath, was elected treasurer. At the fifth meeting Campbell argued that hacking was an essential element of 'football' and that to eliminate hacking would \"do away with all the courage and pluck from the game, and I will be bound over to bring over a lot of Frenchmen who would beat you with a week\u2019s practice.\"[2] At the sixth meeting on 8 December Campbell withdrew Blackheath, explaining that the rules that the FA intended to adopt would destroy the game and all interest in it. Other rugby clubs followed this lead and did not join the Football Association. In this way the great divide between association football and rugby took place.  In December 1870 Edwin Ash, secretary of Richmond Football Club published a letter in the papers which said, \"Those who play the rugby-type game should meet to form a code of practice as various clubs play to rules which differ from others, which makes the game difficult to play.\" On 26 January 1871 a meeting attended by representatives from 22 clubs was held in London at the Pall Mall Restaurant. As a result of this meeting the Rugby Football Union (RFU) was founded. Three lawyers who had been pupils at Rugby School drew up the first laws of the game which were approved in June 1871. The Club is one of seven of the original twenty-one clubs to have survived to this day.  Blackheath initially played its matches on the Heath (meeting and changing at the Princess of Wales public house) but occasional interruptions from spectators led the club to move, initially to a private field (Richardson's Field) in Blackheath before moving to the Rectory Field in 1883.  On 27 March 1871, England (captained by Blackheath's captain and with three other Club players in the 20-strong side) played Scotland at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh, losing by one point. This was the first international rugby union game in history. Richardson's Field hosted the first England v. Wales fixture on 19 February 1881, which England won, again with four Club players in the side.  In 1982 Blackheath joined the list of winning teams at the Glengarth Sevens at Stockport R.U.F.C.  Blackheath were one of the opponents for The Original All Blacks on their 1905\u201306 northern hemisphere tour, the first-ever New Zealand rugby union tour outside of Australasia. The touring side ran out 32\u20130 victors.   After 158 years it was announced that the 2015\u201316 season would be the last playing at the historic Rectory Field as the club had made the difficult decision to move to their training ground, Well Hall in Eltham, for the 2016\u201317 season to maximise matchday revenue and to continue developing for the future.[3][4] Blackheath played their last game at the Rectory Field on 30 April 2016, beating Blaydon 45\u201317.[5]  Source: \"National League 1\".

Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean and northward into the Arctic Ocean, making it the world's second-largest country by total area, with the world's longest coastline. Its border with the United States is the world's longest international land border. The country is characterized by a wide range of both meteorologic and geological regions. It is a sparsely inhabited country of 40\u00a0million people, the vast majority residing south of the 55th parallel in urban areas. Canada's capital is Ottawa and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.  Indigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years. Beginning in the 16th century, British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various armed conflicts, France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces. This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom, highlighted by the Statute of Westminster, 1931, and culminating in the Canada Act 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom.  Canada is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition. The country's head of government is the prime minister, who holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons and is \"called upon\" by the governor general, representing the monarch of Canada, the ceremonial head of state. The country is a Commonwealth realm and is officially bilingual (English and French) in the federal jurisdiction. It is very highly ranked in international measurements of government transparency, quality of life, economic competitiveness, innovation, education and gender equality. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration. Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its history, economy, and culture.  A developed country, Canada has a high nominal per capita income globally and its advanced economy ranks among the largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. It is recognized as a middle power for its role in international affairs, with a tendency to pursue multilateral and international solutions. Canada's peacekeeping role during the 20th century has had a significant influence on its global image. Canada is part of multiple international organizations and forums.  While a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of Canada, the name is now accepted as coming from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word kanata, meaning \"village\" or \"settlement\".[8] In 1535, Indigenous inhabitants of the present-day Quebec City region used the word to direct French explorer Jacques Cartier to the village of Stadacona.[9] Cartier later used the word Canada to refer not only to that particular village but to the entire area subject to Donnacona (the chief at Stadacona);[9] by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the Saint Lawrence River as Canada.[9]  From the 16th to the early 18th century, \"Canada\" referred to the part of New France that lay along the Saint Lawrence River.[10] In 1791, the area became two British colonies called Upper Canada and Lower Canada. These two colonies were collectively named the Canadas until their union as the British Province of Canada in 1841.[11]  Upon Confederation in 1867, Canada was adopted as the legal name for the new country at the London Conference and the word dominion was conferred as the country's title.[12] By the 1950s, the term Dominion of Canada was no longer used by the United Kingdom, which considered Canada a \"realm of the Commonwealth\".[13]  The Canada Act 1982, which brought the Constitution of Canada fully under Canadian control, referred only to Canada. Later that year, the name of the national holiday was changed from Dominion Day to Canada Day.[14] The term Dominion was used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces, though after the Second World War the term federal had replaced dominion.[15]   The first inhabitants of North America are generally hypothesized to have migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 14,000 years ago.[16][17] The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada.[18] The characteristics of Indigenous societies included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks.[19][20] Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations.[21] Indigenous peoples in present-day Canada include the First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis,[22] the last being of mixed descent who originated in the mid-17th century when First Nations people married European settlers and subsequently developed their own identity.[22] The Indigenous population at the time of the first European settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000[24] and two million,[25] with a figure of 500,000 accepted by Canada's Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.[26] As a consequence of European colonization, the Indigenous population declined by forty to eighty percent and several First Nations, such as the Beothuk, disappeared.[27] The decline is attributed to several causes, including the transfer of European diseases, such as influenza, measles, and smallpox, to which they had no natural immunity,[24][28] conflicts over the fur trade, conflicts with the colonial authorities and settlers, and the loss of Indigenous lands to settlers and the subsequent collapse of several nations' self-sufficiency.[29][30]  Although not without conflict, European Canadians' early interactions with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful.[31] First Nations and M\u00e9tis peoples played a critical part in the development of European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting European coureurs des bois and voyageurs in their explorations of the continent during the North American fur trade.[32] These early European interactions with First Nations would change from friendship and peace treaties to the dispossession of Indigenous lands through treaties.[33][34] From the late 18th century, European Canadians forced Indigenous peoples to assimilate into a western Canadian society.[35] These attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced integration through state-funded boarding schools,[36] health-care segregation,[37] and displacement.[38] A period of redress began with the formation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada by the Government of Canada in 2008.[39] This included recognition of past colonial injustices and settlement agreements and betterment of racial discrimination issues, such as addressing the plight of missing and murdered Indigenous women.[39][40]  It is believed that the first documented European to explore the east coast of Canada was Norse explorer Leif Erikson.[42][43] In approximately 1000 AD, the Norse built a small short-lived encampment that was occupied sporadically for perhaps 20 years at L'Anse aux Meadows on the northern tip of Newfoundland.[44] No further European exploration occurred until 1497, when seafarer John Cabot explored and claimed Canada's Atlantic coast in the name of Henry VII of England.[45] In 1534, French explorer Jacques Cartier explored the Gulf of Saint Lawrence where, on July 24, he planted a 10-metre (33\u00a0ft) cross bearing the words, \"long live the King of France\", and took possession of the territory New France in the name of King Francis I.[46] The early 16th century saw European mariners with navigational techniques pioneered by the Basque and Portuguese establish seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast.[47] In general, early settlements during the Age of Discovery appear to have been short-lived due to a combination of the harsh climate, problems with navigating trade routes and competing outputs in Scandinavia.[48][49]  In 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, by the royal prerogative of Queen Elizabeth I, founded St John's, Newfoundland, as the first North American English seasonal camp.[50] In 1600, the French established their first seasonal trading post at Tadoussac along the Saint Lawrence.[44] French explorer Samuel de Champlain arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent year-round European settlements at Port Royal (in 1605) and Quebec City (in 1608).[51] Among the colonists of New France, Canadiens extensively settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and Acadians settled the present-day Maritimes, while fur traders and Catholic missionaries explored the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, and the Mississippi watershed to Louisiana.[52] The Beaver Wars broke out in the mid-17th century over control of the North American fur trade.[53]  The English established additional settlements in Newfoundland in 1610 along with settlements in the Thirteen Colonies to the south.[54][55] A series of four wars erupted in colonial North America between 1689 and 1763; the later wars of the period constituted the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War.[56] Mainland Nova Scotia came under British rule with the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht and Canada and most of New France came under British rule in 1763 after the Seven Years' War.[57]  The Royal Proclamation of 1763 established First Nation treaty rights, created the Province of Quebec out of New France, and annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia.[14] St John's Island (now Prince Edward Island) became a separate colony in 1769.[59] To avert conflict in Quebec, the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act 1774, expanding Quebec's territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley.[60] More importantly, the Quebec Act afforded Quebec special autonomy and rights of self-administration at a time when the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against British rule.[61] It re-established the French language, Catholic faith, and French civil law there, staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the Thirteen Colonies.[62] The Proclamation and the Quebec Act in turn angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies, further fuelling anti-British sentiment in the years prior to the American Revolution.[14]  After the successful American War of Independence, the 1783 Treaty of Paris recognized the independence of the newly formed United States and set the terms of peace, ceding British North American territories south of the Great Lakes and east of the Mississippi River to the new country.[63] The American war of independence also caused a large out-migration of Loyalists, the settlers who had fought against American independence. Many moved to Canada, particularly Atlantic Canada, where their arrival changed the demographic distribution of the existing territories. New Brunswick was in turn split from Nova Scotia as part of a reorganization of Loyalist settlements in the Maritimes, which led to the incorporation of Saint John, New Brunswick, as Canada's first city.[64] To accommodate the influx of English-speaking Loyalists in Central Canada, the Constitutional Act of 1791 divided the province of Canada into French-speaking Lower Canada (later Quebec) and English-speaking Upper Canada (later Ontario), granting each its own elected legislative assembly.[65]  The Canadas were the main front in the War of 1812 between the United States and the United Kingdom. Peace came in 1815; no boundaries were changed.[67] Immigration resumed at a higher level, with over 960,000 arrivals from Britain between 1815 and 1850.[68] New arrivals included refugees escaping the Great Irish Famine as well as Gaelic-speaking Scots displaced by the Highland Clearances.[69] Infectious diseases killed between 25 and 33 percent of Europeans who immigrated to Canada before 1891.[24]  The desire for responsible government resulted in the abortive Rebellions of 1837.[70] The Durham Report subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of French Canadians into English culture.[14] The Act of Union 1840 merged the Canadas into a united Province of Canada and responsible government was established for all provinces of British North America east of Lake Superior by 1855.[71] The signing of the Oregon Treaty by Britain and the United States in 1846 ended the Oregon boundary dispute, extending the border westward along the 49th parallel. This paved the way for British colonies on Vancouver Island (1849) and in British Columbia (1858).[72] The Anglo-Russian Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1825) established the border along the Pacific coast, but, even after the US Alaska Purchase of 1867, disputes continued about the exact demarcation of the Alaska\u2013Yukon and Alaska\u2013BC border.[73]  Following three constitutional conferences, the British North America Act, 1867 officially proclaimed Canadian Confederation on July 1, 1867, initially with four provinces: Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick.[75][76] Canada assumed control of Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory to form the Northwest Territories, where the M\u00e9tis' grievances ignited the Red River Rebellion and the creation of the province of Manitoba in July 1870.[77] British Columbia and Vancouver Island (which had been united in 1866) joined the confederation in 1871 on the promise of a transcontinental railway extending to Victoria in the province within 10 years,[78] while Prince Edward Island joined in 1873.[79] In 1898, during the Klondike Gold Rush in the Northwest Territories, Parliament created the Yukon Territory. Alberta and Saskatchewan became provinces in 1905.[79] Between 1871 and 1896, almost one quarter of the Canadian population emigrated south to the US.[80]  To open the West and encourage European immigration, the Government of Canada sponsored the construction of three transcontinental railways (including the Canadian Pacific Railway), passed the Dominion Lands Act to regulate settlement and established the North-West Mounted Police to assert authority over the territory.[81][82] This period of westward expansion and nation building resulted in the displacement of many Indigenous peoples of the Canadian Prairies to \"Indian reserves\",[83] clearing the way for ethnic European block settlements.[84] This caused the collapse of the Plains Bison in western Canada and the introduction of European cattle farms and wheat fields dominating the land.[85] The Indigenous peoples saw widespread famine and disease due to the loss of the bison and their traditional hunting lands.[86] The federal government did provide emergency relief, on condition of the Indigenous peoples moving to the reserves.[87] During this time, Canada introduced the Indian Act extending its control over the First Nations to education, government and legal rights.[88]  Because Britain still maintained control of Canada's foreign affairs under the British North America Act, 1867, its declaration of war in 1914 automatically brought Canada into the First World War.[89] Volunteers sent to the Western Front later became part of the Canadian Corps, which played a substantial role in the Battle of Vimy Ridge and other major engagements of the war.[90] Out of approximately 625,000 Canadians who served in the First World War, some 60,000 were killed and another 172,000 were wounded.[91] The Conscription Crisis of 1917 erupted when the Unionist Cabinet's proposal to augment the military's dwindling number of active members with conscription was met with vehement objections from French-speaking Quebecers.[92] The Military Service Act brought in compulsory military service, though it, coupled with disputes over French language schools outside Quebec, deeply alienated Francophone Canadians and temporarily split the Liberal Party.[92] In 1919, Canada joined the League of Nations independently of Britain,[90] and the Statute of Westminster, 1931, affirmed Canada's independence.[93]  The Great Depression in Canada during the early 1930s saw an economic downturn, leading to hardship across the country.[94] In response to the downturn, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in Saskatchewan introduced many elements of a welfare state (as pioneered by Tommy Douglas) in the 1940s and 1950s.[95] On the advice of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, war with Germany was declared effective September 10, 1939, by King George VI, seven days after the United Kingdom. The delay underscored Canada's independence.[90]  The first Canadian Army units arrived in Britain in December 1939. In all, over a million Canadians served in the armed forces during the Second World War and approximately 42,000 were killed and another 55,000 were wounded.[96] Canadian troops played important roles in many key battles of the war, including the failed 1942 Dieppe Raid, the Allied invasion of Italy, the Normandy landings, the Battle of Normandy, and the Battle of the Scheldt in 1944.[90] Canada provided asylum for the Dutch monarchy while that country was occupied and is credited by the Netherlands for major contributions to its liberation from Nazi Germany.[97]  The Canadian economy boomed during the war as its industries manufactured military materiel for Canada, Britain, China, and the Soviet Union.[90] Despite another Conscription Crisis in Quebec in 1944, Canada finished the war with a large army and strong economy.[98]  The financial crisis of the Great Depression led the Dominion of Newfoundland to relinquish responsible government in 1934 and become a Crown colony ruled by a British governor.[99] After two referendums, Newfoundlanders voted to join Canada in 1949 as a province.[100]  Canada's post-war economic growth, combined with the policies of successive Liberal governments, led to the emergence of a new Canadian identity, marked by the adoption of the maple leaf flag in 1965,[101] the implementation of official bilingualism (English and French) in 1969,[102] and the institution of official multiculturalism in 1971.[103] Socially democratic programs were also instituted, such as Medicare, the Canada Pension Plan, and Canada Student Loans; though, provincial governments, particularly Quebec and Alberta, opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions.[104]  Finally, another series of constitutional conferences resulted in the Canada Act 1982, the patriation of Canada's constitution from the United Kingdom, concurrent with the creation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.[106][107][108] Canada had established complete sovereignty as an independent country under its own monarchy.[109][110] In 1999, Nunavut became Canada's third territory after a series of negotiations with the federal government.[111]  At the same time, Quebec underwent profound social and economic changes through the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, giving birth to a secular nationalist movement.[112] The radical Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec (FLQ) ignited the October Crisis with a series of bombings and kidnappings in 1970,[113] and the sovereigntist Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois was elected in 1976, organizing an unsuccessful referendum on sovereignty-association in 1980. Attempts to accommodate Quebec nationalism constitutionally through the Meech Lake Accord failed in 1990.[114] This led to the formation of the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois in Quebec and the invigoration of the Reform Party of Canada in the West.[115][116] A second referendum followed in 1995, in which sovereignty was rejected by a slimmer margin of 50.6 to 49.4 percent.[117] In 1997, the Supreme Court ruled unilateral secession by a province would be unconstitutional, and the Clarity Act was passed by Parliament, outlining the terms of a negotiated departure from Confederation.[114]  In addition to the issues of Quebec sovereignty, a number of crises shook Canadian society in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These included the explosion of Air India Flight 182 in 1985, the largest mass murder in Canadian history;[118] the \u00c9cole Polytechnique massacre in 1989, a university shooting targeting female students;[119] and the Oka Crisis of 1990,[120] the first of a number of violent confrontations between provincial governments and Indigenous groups.[121] Canada also joined the Gulf War in 1990 as part of a United States\u2013led coalition force and was active in several peacekeeping missions in the 1990s, including the UNPROFOR mission in the former Yugoslavia.[122] Canada sent troops to Afghanistan in 2001 but declined to join the United States\u2013led invasion of Iraq in 2003.[123]  In 2011, Canadian forces participated in the NATO-led intervention into the Libyan Civil War[124] and also became involved in battling the Islamic State insurgency in Iraq in the mid-2010s.[125] The country celebrated its sesquicentennial in 2017, three years before the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada began on January 27, 2020, with widespread social and economic disruption.[126] In 2021, the possible graves of hundreds of Indigenous people were discovered near the former sites of Canadian Indian residential schools.[127] Administered by various Christian churches and funded by the Canadian government from 1828 to 1997, these boarding schools attempted to assimilate Indigenous children into Euro-Canadian culture.[36]  By total area (including its waters), Canada is the second-largest country in the world, after Russia.[128] By land area alone, Canada ranks fourth, due to having the world's largest area of fresh water lakes.[129] Stretching from the Atlantic Ocean in the east, along the Arctic Ocean to the north, and to the Pacific Ocean in the west, the country encompasses 9,984,670\u00a0km2 (3,855,100\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of territory.[130] Canada also has vast maritime terrain, with the world's longest coastline of 243,042 kilometres (151,019\u00a0mi).[131][132] In addition to sharing the world's largest land border with the United States\u2014spanning 8,891\u00a0km (5,525\u00a0mi)[a]\u2014Canada shares a land border with Greenland (and hence the Kingdom of Denmark) to the northeast, on Hans Island,[133] and a maritime boundary with France's overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon to the southeast.[134] Canada is also home to the world's northernmost settlement, Canadian Forces Station Alert, on the northern tip of Ellesmere Island\u2014latitude 82.5\u00b0N\u2014which lies 817 kilometres (508\u00a0mi) from the North Pole.[135]  Canada can be divided into seven physiographic regions: the Canadian Shield, the interior plains, the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Lowlands, the Appalachian region, the Western Cordillera, Hudson Bay Lowlands, and the Arctic Archipelago.[136] Boreal forests prevail throughout the country, ice is prominent in northern Arctic regions and through the Rocky Mountains, and the relatively flat Canadian Prairies in the southwest facilitate productive agriculture.[130] The Great Lakes feed the St. Lawrence River (in the southeast) where the lowlands host much of Canada's economic output.[130] Canada has over 2,000,000 lakes\u2014563 of which are larger than 100\u00a0km2 (39\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)\u2014containing much of the world's fresh water.[137][138] There are also fresh-water glaciers in the Canadian Rockies, the Coast Mountains, and the Arctic Cordillera.[139] Canada is geologically active, having many earthquakes and potentially active volcanoes, notably Mount Meager massif, Mount Garibaldi, Mount Cayley, and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex.[140]  Average winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary from region to region. Winters can be harsh in many parts of the country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces, which experience a continental climate, where daily average temperatures are near \u221215\u00a0\u00b0C (5\u00a0\u00b0F), but can drop below \u221240\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221240\u00a0\u00b0F) with severe wind chills.[141] In non-coastal regions, snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year, while in parts of the north snow can persist year-round. Coastal British Columbia has a temperate climate, with a mild and rainy winter. On the east and west coasts, average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s \u00b0C (70s \u00b0F), while between the coasts, the average summer high temperature ranges from 25 to 30\u00a0\u00b0C (77 to 86\u00a0\u00b0F), with temperatures in some interior locations occasionally exceeding 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F).[142]  Much of Northern Canada is covered by ice and permafrost. The future of the permafrost is uncertain because the Arctic has been warming at three times the global average as a result of climate change in Canada.[143] Canada's annual average temperature over land has risen by 1.7\u00a0\u00b0C (3.1\u00a0\u00b0F), with changes ranging from 1.1 to 2.3\u00a0\u00b0C (2.0 to 4.1\u00a0\u00b0F) in various regions, since 1948.[130] The rate of warming has been higher across the North and in the Prairies.[144] In the southern regions of Canada, air pollution from both Canada and the United States\u2014caused by metal smelting, burning coal to power utilities, and vehicle emissions\u2014has resulted in acid rain, which has severely impacted waterways, forest growth, and agricultural productivity in Canada.[145]  Canada is divided into 15 terrestrial and five marine ecozones.[147] These ecozones encompass over 80,000 classified species of Canadian wildlife, with an equal number yet to be formally recognized or discovered.[148] Although Canada has a low percentage of endemic species compared to other countries,[149] due to human activities, invasive species, and environmental issues in the country, there are currently more than 800 species at risk of being lost.[150] About 65 percent of Canada's resident species are considered \"Secure\".[151] Over half of Canada's landscape is intact and relatively free of human development.[152] The boreal forest of Canada is considered to be the largest intact forest on Earth, with approximately 3,000,000\u00a0km2 (1,200,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) undisturbed by roads, cities or industry.[153] Since the end of the last glacial period, Canada has consisted of eight distinct forest regions,[154] with 42 percent of its land area covered by forests (approximately 8 percent of the world's forested land).[155]  Approximately 12.1 percent of the nation's landmass and freshwater are conservation areas, including 11.4 percent designated as protected areas.[156] Approximately 13.8 percent of its territorial waters are conserved, including 8.9 percent designated as protected areas.[156] Canada's first National Park, Banff National Park established in 1885, spans 6,641 square kilometres (2,564\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)[157] of mountainous terrain, with many glaciers and ice fields, dense coniferous forest, and alpine landscapes.[158] Canada's oldest provincial park, Algonquin Provincial Park, established in 1893, covers an area of 7,653.45 square kilometres (2,955.01\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). It is dominated by old-growth forest with over 2,400 lakes and 1,200 kilometres of streams and rivers.[159] Lake Superior National Marine Conservation Area is the world's largest freshwater protected area, spanning roughly 10,000 square kilometres (3,900\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of lakebed, its overlaying freshwater, and associated shoreline on 60 square kilometres (23\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of islands and mainland.[160] Canada's largest national wildlife region is the Scott Islands Marine National Wildlife Area, which spans 11,570.65 square kilometres (4,467.45\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)[161] and protects critical breeding and nesting habitat for over 40 percent of British Columbia's seabirds.[162] Canada's 18 UNESCO Biosphere Reserves cover a total area of 235,000 square kilometres (91,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[163]  Canada is described as a \"full democracy\",[164] with a tradition of liberalism,[165] and an egalitarian,[166] moderate political ideology.[167] An emphasis on social justice has been a distinguishing element of Canada's political culture.[168][169] Peace, order, and good government, alongside an Implied Bill of Rights, are founding principles of the Canadian government.[170][171]  At the federal level, Canada has been dominated by two relatively centrist parties practising \"brokerage politics\":[b] the centre-left leaning Liberal Party of Canada[178][179] and the centre-right leaning Conservative Party of Canada (or its predecessors).[180] The historically predominant Liberals position themselves at the centre of the political scale.[180] Five parties had representatives elected to the Parliament in the 2021 election\u2014the Liberals, who formed a minority government; the Conservatives, who became the Official Opposition; the New Democratic Party (occupying the left[181][182]); the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois; and the Green Party of Canada.[183] Far-right and far-left politics have never been a prominent force in Canadian society.[184][185][186]  Canada has a parliamentary system within the context of a constitutional monarchy\u2014the monarchy of Canada being the foundation of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.[187][188][189][190] The reigning monarch is also monarch of 14 other Commonwealth countries (though, all are sovereign of one another[191]) and each of Canada's 10 provinces. To carry out most of their federal royal duties in Canada, the monarch appoints a representative, the governor general, on the advice of the prime minister.[192][193]  The monarchy is the source of sovereignty and authority in Canada.[190][194][195] However, while the governor general or monarch may exercise their power without ministerial advice in certain rare crisis situations,[194] the use of the executive powers (or royal prerogative) is otherwise always directed by the Cabinet, a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to the elected House of Commons and chosen and headed by the prime minister,[196] the head of government. To ensure the stability of government, the governor general will usually appoint as prime minister the individual who is the current leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a majority of members in the House of Commons.[197] The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) is thus one of the most powerful institutions in government, initiating most legislation for parliamentary approval and selecting for appointment by the Crown, besides the aforementioned, the governor general, lieutenant governors, senators, federal court judges, and heads of Crown corporations and government agencies.[194] The leader of the party with the second-most seats usually becomes the leader of the Official Opposition and is part of an adversarial parliamentary system intended to keep the government in check.[198]  The Parliament of Canada passes all statute laws within the federal sphere. It comprises the monarch, the House of Commons, and the Senate. While Canada inherited the British concept of parliamentary supremacy, this was later, with the enactment of the Constitution Act, 1982, all but completely superseded by the American notion of the supremacy of the law.[200]  Each of the 338 members of Parliament in the House of Commons is elected by simple plurality in an electoral district or riding. The Constitution Act, 1982, requires that no more than five years pass between elections, although the Canada Elections Act limits this to four years with a \"fixed\" election date in October; general elections still must be called by the governor general and can be triggered by either the advice of the prime minister or a lost confidence vote in the House.[201][202] The 105 members of the Senate, whose seats are apportioned on a regional basis, serve until age 75.[203]  Canadian federalism divides government responsibilities between the federal government and the 10 provinces. Provincial legislatures are unicameral and operate in parliamentary fashion similar to the House of Commons.[195] Canada's three territories also have legislatures; but, these are not sovereign and have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the provinces.[204] The territorial legislatures also differ structurally from their provincial counterparts.[205]  The Bank of Canada is the central bank of the country.[206] The minister of finance and minister of innovation, science, and industry use the Statistics Canada agency for financial planning and economic policy development.[207] The Bank of Canada is the sole authority authorized to issue currency in the form of Canadian bank notes.[208] The bank does not issue Canadian coins; they are issued by the Royal Canadian Mint.[209]  The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of the country and consists of written text and unwritten conventions.[210] The Constitution Act, 1867 (known as the British North America Act, 1867 prior to 1982), affirmed governance based on parliamentary precedent and divided powers between the federal and provincial governments.[211] The Statute of Westminster, 1931, granted full autonomy, and the Constitution Act, 1982, ended all legislative ties to Britain, as well as adding a constitutional amending formula and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.[212] The Charter guarantees basic rights and freedoms that usually cannot be over-ridden by any government; though, a notwithstanding clause allows Parliament and the provincial legislatures to override certain sections of the Charter for a period of five years.[213]  Canada's judiciary plays an important role in interpreting laws and has the power to strike down acts of Parliament that violate the constitution. The Supreme Court of Canada is the highest court, final arbiter, and has been led since December 18, 2017, by Richard Wagner, the Chief Justice of Canada.[214] The governor general appoints the court's nine members on the advice of the prime minister and minister of justice.[215] The federal Cabinet also appoints justices to superior courts in the provincial and territorial jurisdictions.[216]  Common law prevails everywhere, except in Quebec, where civil law predominates.[217] Criminal law is solely a federal responsibility and is uniform throughout Canada.[218] Law enforcement, including criminal courts, is officially a provincial responsibility, conducted by provincial and municipal police forces.[219] In most rural and some urban areas, policing responsibilities are contracted to the federal Royal Canadian Mounted Police.[220]  Canadian Aboriginal law provides certain constitutionally recognized rights to land and traditional practices for Indigenous groups in Canada.[221] Various treaties and case laws were established to mediate relations between Europeans and many Indigenous peoples.[222] Most notably, a series of 11 treaties, known as the Numbered Treaties, were signed between the Indigenous peoples and the reigning monarch of Canada between 1871 and 1921.[223] These treaties are agreements between the Canadian Crown-in-Council, with the duty to consult and accommodate.[224] The role of Aboriginal law and the rights they support were reaffirmed by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.[222] These rights may include provision of services, such as healthcare through the Indian Health Transfer Policy, and exemption from taxation.[225]  Canada is recognized as a middle power for its role in global affairs with a tendency to pursue multilateral and international solutions.[227][228][229] Canada's foreign policy based on international peacekeeping and security is carried out through coalitions, international organizations, and the work of numerous federal institutions.[230][231] The strategy of the Canadian government's foreign aid policy reflects an emphasis to meet the Sustainable Development Goals, while also providing assistance in response to foreign humanitarian crises.[232] The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) is tasked with gathering and analyzing intelligence to prevent threats such as terrorism, espionage, and foreign interference,[233] while the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) is focused on cyber security and protecting Canada's digital infrastructure.[233]  Canada and the United States have a long, complex, and intertwined relationship;[234][235] they are close allies, co-operating regularly on military campaigns and humanitarian efforts.[236][237] Canada also maintains historic and traditional ties to the United Kingdom and to France,[238] along with both countries' former colonies through its membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie.[239] Canada is noted for having a positive relationship with the Netherlands, owing, in part, to its contribution to the Dutch liberation during the Second World War.[97] Canada has diplomatic and consular offices in over 270 locations in approximately 180 foreign countries.[226]  Canada's peacekeeping role during the 20th century has played a major role in its positive global image.[240][241] The Suez Crisis of 1956, saw future prime minister Lester B. Pearson eased tensions by proposing the inception of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, for which he was awarded the 1957 Nobel Peace Prize.[242] Canada has served in over 50 peacekeeping missions providing the greatest amount of peacekeepers during the Cold War.[243] Since the 21st century, Canadian direct participation in UN peacekeeping efforts has greatly declined.[244] The large decrease was a result of Canada directing its participation to UN-sanctioned military operations through NATO, rather than directly through the UN.[245] Canada has also faced controversy over its involvement in some foreign countries, notably the 1993 Somalia affair.[246]  As of 2024, Canada's military had over 3000 personnel deployed overseas in multiple operations.[248] The unified Canadian Forces (CF) comprise the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army, and Royal Canadian Air Force. The nation employs a professional, volunteer force of approximately 68,000 active personnel and 27,000 reserve personnel\u2014increasing to 71,500 and 30,000 respectively under \"Strong, Secure, Engaged\"[249]\u2014with a sub-component of approximately 5,000 Canadian Rangers.[250][c] In 2022, Canada's military expenditure totalled approximately $26.9\u00a0billion, or around 1.2\u00a0percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP)\u00a0\u2013 placing it 14th for military expenditure by country.[252]  Canada is a member of various international organizations and forums.[253] Canada was a founding member of the United Nations in 1945 and formed the North American Aerospace Defense Command together with the United States in 1958.[254] The country has membership in the World Trade Organization, the Five Eyes, the G7 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).[227] The country joined the Organization of American States (OAS) in 1990,[255] and seeks to expand its ties to Pacific Rim economies through membership in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC).[256] Canada ratified the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, and seven principal UN human rights conventions and covenants since then.[257]  Canada is a federation composed of 10 federated states, called provinces, and three federal territories. In turn, these may be grouped into four main regions: Western Canada, Central Canada, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Canada (Eastern Canada refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together).[259] Provinces and territories have responsibility for social programs such as healthcare, education, and welfare,[260] as well as administration of justice (but not criminal law). Together, the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government, a rarity among other federations in the world. Using its spending powers, the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas such as health and child care; the provinces can opt out of these cost-share programs but rarely do so in practice. Equalization payments are made by the federal government to ensure reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.[261]  The major difference between a Canadian province and a territory is that provinces receive their sovereignty from the Crown[262] and power and authority from the Constitution Act, 1867, whereas territorial governments have powers delegated to them by the Parliament of Canada[263] and the commissioners represent the King in his federal Council,[264] rather than the monarch directly. The powers flowing from the Constitution Act, 1867, are divided between the federal government and the provincial governments to exercise exclusively[265] and any changes to that arrangement require a constitutional amendment, while changes to the roles and powers of the territories may be performed unilaterally by the Parliament of Canada.[266]  Canada has a highly developed mixed-market economy,[268][269] with the world's ninth-largest economy as of 2023[update], and a nominal GDP of approximately US$2.221\u00a0trillion.[270] It is one of the world's largest trading nations, with a highly globalized economy.[271] In 2021, Canadian trade in goods and services reached $2.016\u00a0trillion.[272] Canada's exports totalled over $637\u00a0billion, while its imported goods were worth over $631\u00a0billion, of which approximately $391\u00a0billion originated from the United States.[272] In 2018, Canada had a trade deficit in goods of $22\u00a0billion and a trade deficit in services of $25\u00a0billion.[272] The Toronto Stock Exchange is the ninth-largest stock exchange in the world by market capitalization, listing over 1,500 companies with a combined market capitalization of over US$2\u00a0trillion.[273]  Canada has a strong cooperative banking sector, with the world's highest per-capita membership in credit unions.[274] It ranks low in the Corruption Perceptions Index (14th in 2023)[275] and \"is widely regarded as among the least corrupt countries of the world\".[276] It ranks high in the Global Competitiveness Report (14th in 2019)[277] and Global Innovation Index (15th in 2023).[278] Canada's economy ranks above most Western nations on The Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom[279] and experiences a relatively low level of income disparity.[280] The country's average household disposable income per capita is \"well above\" the OECD average.[281] Canada ranks among the lowest of the most developed countries for housing affordability[282][283] and foreign direct investment.[284][283]  Since the early 20th century, the growth of Canada's manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy to an urbanized, industrial one.[285] Like many other developed countries, the Canadian economy is dominated by the service industry, which employs about three-quarters of the country's workforce.[286] Among developed countries, Canada has an unusually important primary sector, of which the forestry and petroleum industries are the most prominent components.[287] Many towns in northern Canada, where agriculture is difficult, are sustained by nearby mines or sources of timber.[288]  Canada's economic integration with the United States has increased significantly since the Second World War.[290] The Automotive Products Trade Agreement of 1965 opened Canada's borders to trade in the automobile manufacturing industry.[291] The Canada\u00a0\u2013 United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the two countries, while the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) expanded the free-trade zone to include Mexico in 1994 (later replaced by the Canada\u2013United States\u2013Mexico Agreement).[292] As of 2023, Canada is a signatory to 15 free trade agreements with 51 different countries.[289]  Canada is one of the few developed nations that are net exporters of energy.[287][293] Atlantic Canada possess vast offshore deposits of natural gas,[294] and Alberta hosts the fourth-largest oil reserves in the world.[295] The vast Athabasca oil sands and other oil reserves give Canada 13\u00a0percent of global oil reserves, constituting the world's third or fourth-largest.[296] Canada is additionally one of the world's largest suppliers of agricultural products; the Canadian Prairies region is one of the most important global producers of wheat, canola, and other grains.[297] The country is a leading exporter of zinc, uranium, gold, nickel, platinoids, aluminum, steel, iron ore, coking coal, lead, copper, molybdenum, cobalt, and cadmium.[298][299] Canada has a sizeable manufacturing sector centred in southern Ontario and Quebec, with automobiles and aeronautics representing particularly important industries.[300] The fishing industry is also a key contributor to the economy.[301]  In 2020, Canada spent approximately $41.9\u00a0billion on domestic research and development, with supplementary estimates for 2022 at $43.2\u00a0billion.[302] As of 2023[update], the country has produced 15 Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, and medicine.[303] The country ranks seventh in the worldwide share of articles published in scientific journals, according to the Nature Index,[304] and is home to the headquarters of a number of global technology firms.[305] Canada has one of the highest levels of Internet access in the world, with over 33\u00a0million users, equivalent to around 94 percent of its total population.[306]  Canada's developments in science and technology include the creation of the modern alkaline battery,[308] the discovery of insulin,[309] the development of the polio vaccine,[310] and discoveries about the interior structure of the atomic nucleus.[311] Other major Canadian scientific contributions include the artificial cardiac pacemaker, mapping the visual cortex,[312][313] the development of the electron microscope,[314][315] plate tectonics, deep learning, multi-touch technology, and the identification of the first black hole, Cygnus X-1.[316] Canada has a long history of discovery in genetics, which include stem cells, site-directed mutagenesis, T-cell receptor, and the identification of the genes that cause Fanconi anemia, cystic fibrosis, and early-onset Alzheimer's disease, among numerous other diseases.[313][317]  The Canadian Space Agency operates a highly active space program, conducting deep-space, planetary, and aviation research and developing rockets and satellites.[318] Canada was the third country to design and construct a satellite after the Soviet Union and the United States, with the 1962 Alouette 1 launch.[319] Canada is a participant in the International Space Station (ISS), and is a pioneer in space robotics, having constructed the Canadarm, Canadarm2, Canadarm3 and Dextre robotic manipulators for the ISS and NASA's Space Shuttle.[320] Since the 1960s, Canada's aerospace industry has designed and built numerous marques of satellite, including Radarsat-1 and 2, ISIS, and MOST.[321] Canada has also produced one of the world's most successful and widely used sounding rockets, the Black Brant.[322]  The 2021 Canadian census enumerated a total population of 36,991,981, an increase of around 5.2 percent over the 2016 figure.[324] It is estimated that Canada's population surpassed 40,000,000 in 2023.[325] The main drivers of population growth are immigration and, to a lesser extent, natural growth.[326] Canada has one of the highest per-capita immigration rates in the world,[327] driven mainly by economic policy and also family reunification.[328][329] A record 405,000 immigrants were admitted to Canada in 2021.[330] Canada leads the world in refugee resettlement; it resettled more than 28,000 in 2018.[331] New immigrants settle mostly in major urban areas in the country, such as Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.[332]  Canada's population density, at 4.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (11\/sq\u00a0mi), is among the lowest in the world.[324] Canada spans latitudinally from the 83rd parallel north to the 41st parallel north and approximately 95\u00a0percent of the population is found south of the 55th parallel north.[333] About 80 percent of the population lives within 150 kilometres (93\u00a0mi) of the border with the contiguous United States.[334] Canada is highly urbanized, with over 80 percent of the population living urban centres.[335] The most densely populated part of the country, accounting for nearly 50 percent, is the Quebec City\u2013Windsor Corridor in Southern Quebec and Southern Ontario along the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River.[336][333]  The majority of Canadians (81.1\u00a0percent) live in family households, 12.1\u00a0percent report living alone, and those living with other relatives or unrelated persons reported at 6.8\u00a0percent.[337] Fifty-one\u00a0percent of households are couples with or without children, 8.7\u00a0percent are single-parent households, 2.9\u00a0percent are multigenerational households, and 29.3\u00a0percent are single-person households.[337]   According to the 2021 Canadian census, over 450 \"ethnic or cultural origins\" were self-reported by Canadians.[339] The major panethnic groups chosen were: European (52.5\u00a0percent), North American (22.9\u00a0percent), Asian (19.3\u00a0percent), North American Indigenous (6.1\u00a0percent), African (3.8\u00a0percent), Latin, Central and South American (2.5\u00a0percent), Caribbean (2.1\u00a0percent), Oceanian (0.3\u00a0percent), and other (6\u00a0percent).[339][340] Over 60 percent of Canadians reported a single origin, and 36 percent of Canadians reported having multiple ethnic origins, thus the overall total is greater than 100\u00a0percent.[339]  The country's ten largest self-reported specific ethnic or cultural origins in 2021 were Canadian[d] (accounting for 15.6\u00a0percent of the population), followed by English (14.7\u00a0percent), Irish (12.1\u00a0percent), Scottish (12.1\u00a0percent), French (11.0\u00a0percent), German (8.1\u00a0percent), Chinese (4.7\u00a0percent), Italian (4.3\u00a0percent), Indian (3.7\u00a0percent), and Ukrainian (3.5\u00a0percent).[345]  Of the 36.3 million people enumerated in 2021, approximately 25.4 million reported being \"White\", representing 69.8\u00a0percent of the population.[346] The Indigenous population representing 5\u00a0percent or 1.8 million individuals, grew by 9.4\u00a0percent compared to the non-Indigenous population, which grew by 5.3\u00a0percent from 2016 to 2021.[346] One out of every four Canadians or 26.5\u00a0percent of the population belonged to a non-White and non-Indigenous visible minority,[347][e] the largest of which in 2021 were South Asian (2.6 million people; 7.1\u00a0percent), Chinese (1.7 million; 4.7\u00a0percent), and Black (1.5 million; 4.3\u00a0percent).[349]  Between 2011 and 2016, the visible minority population rose by 18.4\u00a0percent.[350] In 1961, about 300,000 people, less than two percent of Canada's population, were members of visible minority groups.[351] The 2021 census indicated that 8.3\u00a0million people, or almost one-quarter (23.0\u00a0percent) of the population, reported themselves as being or having been a landed immigrant or permanent resident in Canada\u2014above the 1921 census previous record of 22.3\u00a0percent.[352] In 2021, India, China, and the Philippines were the top three countries of origin for immigrants moving to Canada.[353]  A multitude of languages are used by Canadians, with English and French (the official languages) being the mother tongues of approximately 54\u00a0percent and 19\u00a0percent of Canadians, respectively.[337] As of the 2021 census, just over 7.8\u00a0million Canadians listed a non-official language as their mother tongue. Some of the most common non-official first languages include Mandarin (679,255 first-language speakers), Punjabi (666,585), Cantonese (553,380), Spanish (538,870), Arabic (508,410), Tagalog (461,150), Italian (319,505), German (272,865), and Tamil (237,890).[337] Canada's federal government practises official bilingualism, which is applied by the commissioner of official languages in consonance with section 16 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the federal Official Languages Act. English and French have equal status in federal courts, Parliament, and in all federal institutions. Citizens have the right, where there is sufficient demand, to receive federal government services in either English or French and official-language minorities are guaranteed their own schools in all provinces and territories.[355]  Quebec's 1974 Official Language Act established French as the only official language of the province.[356] Although more than 82 percent of French-speaking Canadians live in Quebec, there are substantial Francophone populations in New Brunswick, Alberta, and Manitoba; Ontario has the largest French-speaking population outside Quebec.[357] New Brunswick, the only officially bilingual province, has a French-speaking Acadian minority constituting 33 percent of the population.[358] There are also clusters of Acadians in southwestern Nova Scotia, on Cape Breton Island, and in central and western Prince Edward Island.[359]  Other provinces have no official languages as such, but French is used as a language of instruction, in courts, and for other government services, in addition to English. Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec allow for both English and French to be spoken in the provincial legislatures and laws are enacted in both languages. In Ontario, French has some legal status, but is not fully co-official.[360] There are 11 Indigenous language groups, composed of more than 65 distinct languages and dialects.[361] Several Indigenous languages have official status in the Northwest Territories.[362] Inuktitut is the majority language in Nunavut and is one of three official languages in the territory.[363]  Additionally, Canada is home to many sign languages, some of which are Indigenous.[364] American Sign Language (ASL) is used across the country due to the prevalence of ASL in primary and secondary schools.[365] Quebec Sign Language (LSQ) is used primarily in Quebec.[366]  Canada is religiously diverse, encompassing a wide range of beliefs and customs.[368] The Constitution of Canada refers to God and the monarch carries the title of Defender of the Faith; however, Canada has no official church and the government is officially committed to religious pluralism.[369] Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right, allowing individuals to assemble and worship without limitation or interference.[370]  Rates of religious adherence have steadily decreased since the 1970s.[368] With Christianity in decline after having once been central and integral to Canadian culture and daily life,[371] Canada has become a post-Christian, secular state.[372][373][374] Although the majority of Canadians consider religion to be unimportant in their daily lives,[375] they still believe in God.[376] The practice of religion is generally considered a private matter throughout Canadian society and by the state.[377]  According to the 2021 census, Christianity is the largest religion in Canada, with Roman Catholics representing 29.9\u00a0percent of the population having the most adherents. Christians overall representing 53.3\u00a0percent of the population,[f] are followed by people reporting irreligion or having no religion at 34.6\u00a0percent.[380] Other faiths include Islam (4.9\u00a0percent), Hinduism (2.3\u00a0percent), Sikhism (2.1\u00a0percent), Buddhism (1.0\u00a0percent), Judaism (0.9\u00a0percent), and Indigenous spirituality (0.2\u00a0percent).[381] Canada has the second-largest national Sikh population, behind India.[382]  Healthcare in Canada is delivered through the provincial and territorial systems of publicly funded health care, informally called Medicare.[383][384] It is guided by the provisions of the Canada Health Act of 1984[385] and is universal.[386] Universal access to publicly funded health services \"is often considered by Canadians as a fundamental value that ensures national healthcare insurance for everyone wherever they live in the country.\"[387] Around 30\u00a0percent of Canadians' healthcare is paid for through the private sector.[388] This mostly pays for services not covered or partially covered by Medicare, such as prescription drugs, dentistry and optometry.[388] Approximately 65 to 75\u00a0percent of Canadians have some form of supplementary health insurance; many receive it through their employers or access secondary social service programs.[389][388]  In common with many other developed countries, Canada is experiencing an increase in healthcare expenditures due to a demographic shift toward an older population, with more retirees and fewer people of working age. In 2021, the average age in Canada was 41.9 years.[337] Life expectancy is 81.1 years.[390] A 2016 report by the chief public health officer found that 88\u00a0percent of Canadians, one of the highest proportions of the population among G7 countries, indicated that they \"had good or very good health\".[391] Eighty\u00a0percent of Canadian adults self-report having at least one major risk factor for chronic disease: smoking, physical inactivity, unhealthy eating or excessive alcohol use.[392] Canada has one of the highest rates of adult obesity among OECD countries, contributing to approximately 2.7\u00a0million cases of diabetes.[392] Four chronic diseases\u2014cancer (leading cause of death), cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and diabetes\u2014account for 65\u00a0percent of deaths in Canada.[393][394]  In 2021, the Canadian Institute for Health Information reported that healthcare spending reached $308\u00a0billion, or 12.7 percent of Canada's GDP for that year.[395] In 2022, Canada's per-capita spending on health expenditures ranked 12th among health-care systems in the OECD.[396] Canada has performed close to, or above the average on the majority of OECD health indicators since the early 2000s, ranking above the average on OECD indicators for wait-times and access to care, with average scores for quality of care and use of resources.[397][398] The Commonwealth Fund's 2021 report comparing the healthcare systems of the 11 most developed countries ranked Canada second-to-last.[399] Identified weaknesses were comparatively higher infant mortality rate, the prevalence of chronic conditions, long wait times, poor availability of after-hours care, and a lack of prescription drugs and dental coverage.[399] An increasing problem in Canada's health system is a lack of healthcare professionals,[400] and hospital capacity.[401]  Education in Canada is for the most part provided publicly, funded and overseen by federal, provincial, and local governments.[402] Education is within provincial jurisdiction and a province's curriculum is overseen by its government.[403][404] Education in Canada is generally divided into primary education, followed by secondary and post-secondary education. Education in both English and French is available in most places across Canada.[405] Canada has a large number of universities, almost all of which are publicly funded.[406] Established in 1663, Universit\u00e9 Laval is the oldest post-secondary institution in Canada.[407] The largest university is the University of Toronto, with over 85,000 students.[408] Four universities are regularly ranked among the top 100 worldwide, namely University of Toronto, University of British Columbia, McGill University, and McMaster University, with a total of 18 universities ranked in the top 500 worldwide.[409]  According to a 2022 report by the OECD, Canada is one of the most educated countries in the world;[411][412] the country ranks first worldwide in the percentage of adults having tertiary education, with over 56 percent of Canadian adults having attained at least an undergraduate college or university degree.[413] Canada spends an average of 5.3\u00a0percent of its GDP on education.[414] The country invests heavily in tertiary education (more than US$20,000 per student).[415] As of 2022[update], 89 percent of adults aged 25 to 64 have earned the equivalent of a high-school degree, compared to an OECD average of 75 percent.[416]  The mandatory education age ranges between 5\u20137 to 16\u201318 years,[417] contributing to an adult literacy rate of 99 percent.[418] Just over 60,000 children are homeschooled in the country as of 2016. The Programme for International Student Assessment indicates Canadian students perform well above the OECD average, particularly in mathematics, science, and reading,[419][420] ranking the overall knowledge and skills of Canadian 15-year-olds as the sixth-best in the world, although these scores have been declining in recent years. Canada is a well-performing OECD country in reading literacy, mathematics, and science, with the average student scoring 523.7, compared with the OECD average of 493 in 2015.[421][422]  Canada's culture draws influences from its broad range of constituent nationalities and policies that promote a \"just society\" are constitutionally protected.[424][425][426] Since the 1960s, Canada has emphasized equality and inclusiveness for all its people.[427][428][429] The official state policy of multiculturalism is often cited as one of Canada's significant accomplishments[430] and a key distinguishing element of Canadian identity.[431][432] In Quebec, cultural identity is strong and there is a French Canadian culture that is distinct from English Canadian culture.[433] As a whole, Canada is in theory a cultural mosaic of regional ethnic subcultures.[434][435][436]  Canada's approach to governance emphasizing multiculturalism, which is based on selective immigration, social integration, and suppression of far-right politics, has wide public support.[437] Government policies such as publicly funded health care, higher taxation to redistribute wealth, the outlawing of capital punishment, strong efforts to eliminate poverty, strict gun control, a social liberal attitude toward women's rights (like pregnancy termination) and LGBT rights, and legalized euthanasia and cannabis use are indicators of Canada's political and cultural values.[438][439][440] Canadians also identify with the country's foreign aid policies, peacekeeping roles, the national park system, and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.[441][442]  Historically, Canada has been influenced by British, French, and Indigenous cultures and traditions. Through their language, art, and music, Indigenous peoples continue to influence the Canadian identity.[443] During the 20th century, Canadians with African, Caribbean, and Asian nationalities have added to the Canadian identity and its culture.[444]  Themes of nature, pioneers, trappers, and traders played an important part in the early development of Canadian symbolism.[446] Modern symbols emphasize the country's geography, cold climate, lifestyles, and the Canadianization of traditional European and Indigenous symbols.[447] The use of the maple leaf as a Canadian symbol dates to the early 18th century. The maple leaf is depicted on Canada's current and previous flags and on the Arms of Canada.[448] Canada's official tartan, known as the \"maple leaf tartan\", has four colours that reflect the colours of the maple leaf as it changes through the seasons\u2014green in the spring, gold in the early autumn, red at the first frost, and brown after falling.[449] The Arms of Canada are closely modelled after those of the United Kingdom, with French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British version.[450]  Other prominent symbols include the national motto, \"A mari usque ad mare\" (\"From Sea to Sea\"),[451] the sports of ice hockey and lacrosse, the beaver, Canada goose, common loon, Canadian horse, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Canadian Rockies,[448] and, more recently, the totem pole and Inuksuk.[452] Canadian beer, maple syrup, tuques, canoes, nanaimo bars, butter tarts, and poutine are defined as uniquely Canadian.[452][453] Canadian coins feature many of these symbols: the loon on the $1 coin, the Arms of Canada on the 50\u00a2 piece, and the beaver on the nickel.[454] An image of the previous monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, appears on $20 bank notes and the obverse of all current Canadian coins.[454]  Canadian literature is often divided into French- and English-language literatures, which are rooted in the literary traditions of France and Britain, respectively.[455] The earliest Canadian narratives were of travel and exploration.[456] This progressed into three major themes that can be found within historical Canadian literature: nature, frontier life, and Canada's position within the world, all three of which tie into the garrison mentality.[457] In recent decades, Canada's literature has been strongly influenced by immigrants from around the world.[458] By the 1990s, Canadian literature was viewed as some of the world's best.[459]  Numerous Canadian authors have accumulated international literary awards,[460] including novelist, poet, and literary critic Margaret Atwood, who received two Booker Prizes;[461] Nobel laureate Alice Munro, who has been called the best living writer of short stories in English;[462] and Booker Prize recipient Michael Ondaatje, who wrote the novel The English Patient, which was adapted as a film of the same name that won the Academy Award for Best Picture.[463] L.

Montgomery produced a series of children's novels beginning in 1908 with Anne of Green Gables.[464]  Canada's media is highly autonomous, uncensored, diverse, and very regionalized.[465][466] The Broadcasting Act declares \"the system should serve to safeguard, enrich, and strengthen the cultural, political, social, and economic fabric of Canada\".[467] Canada has a well-developed media sector, but its cultural output\u2014particularly in English films, television shows, and magazines\u2014is often overshadowed by imports from the United States.[468] As a result, the preservation of a distinctly Canadian culture is supported by federal government programs, laws, and institutions such as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).[469]  Canadian mass media, both print and digital, and in both official languages, is largely dominated by a \"handful of corporations\".[470] The largest of these corporations is the country's national public broadcaster, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which also plays a significant role in producing domestic cultural content, operating its own radio and TV networks in both English and French.[471] In addition to the CBC, some provincial governments offer their own public educational TV broadcast services as well, such as TVOntario and T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec.[472]  Non-news media content in Canada, including film and television, is influenced both by local creators as well as by imports from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and France.[473] In an effort to reduce the amount of foreign-made media, government interventions in television broadcasting can include both regulation of content and public financing.[474] Canadian tax laws limit foreign competition in magazine advertising.[475]  Art in Canada is marked by thousands of years of habitation by its Indigenous peoples,[477] and, in later times, artists have combined British, French, Indigenous, and American artistic traditions, at times embracing European styles while working to promote nationalism.[478] The nature of Canadian art reflects these diverse origins, as artists have taken their traditions and adapted these influences to reflect the reality of their lives in Canada.[479]  The Canadian government has played a role in the development of Canadian culture through the department of Canadian Heritage, by giving grants to art galleries,[480] as well as establishing and funding art schools and colleges across the country, and through the Canada Council for the Arts, the national public arts funder, helping artists, art galleries and periodicals, and thus contributing to the development of Canada's cultural works.[481]  Canadian visual art has been dominated by figures, such as painter Tom Thomson and the Group of Seven.[482] The latter were painters with a nationalistic and idealistic focus, who first exhibited their distinctive works in May 1920. Though referred to as having seven members, five artists\u2014Lawren Harris, A. Y. Jackson, Arthur Lismer, J. E. H. MacDonald, and Frederick Varley\u2014were responsible for articulating the group's ideas. They were joined briefly by Frank Johnston and commercial artist Franklin Carmichael. A. J. Casson became part of the group in 1926.[483] Associated with the group was another prominent Canadian artist, Emily Carr, known for her landscapes and portrayals of the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast.[484]  Canadian music reflects a variety of regional scenes.[486] Canada has developed a vast music infrastructure that includes church halls, chamber halls, conservatories, academies, performing arts centres, record companies, radio stations, and television music video channels.[487] Government support programs, such as the Canada Music Fund, assist a wide range of musicians and entrepreneurs who create, produce and market original and diverse Canadian music.[488] As a result of its cultural importance, as well as government initiatives and regulations, the Canadian music industry is one of the largest in the world,[489] producing internationally renowned composers, musicians, and ensembles.[490] Music broadcasting in the country is regulated by the CRTC.[491] The Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences presents Canada's music industry awards, the Juno Awards.[492] The Canadian Music Hall of Fame honours Canadian musicians for their lifetime achievements.[493]  Patriotic music in Canada dates back over 200 years. The earliest work of patriotic music in Canada, \"The Bold Canadian\", was written in 1812.[494] \"The Maple Leaf Forever\", written in 1866, was a popular patriotic song throughout English Canada and, for many years, served as an unofficial national anthem.[495] \"O Canada\" also served as an unofficial national anthem for much of the 20th century and was adopted as the country's official anthem in 1980.[496] Calixa Lavall\u00e9e wrote the music, which was a setting of a patriotic poem composed by the poet and judge Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier. The text was originally only in French before it was adapted into English in 1906.[497]  The roots of organized sports in Canada date back to the 1770s,[499] culminating in the development and popularization of the major professional games of ice hockey, lacrosse, curling, basketball, baseball, soccer, and Canadian football.[500] Canada's official national sports are ice hockey and lacrosse.[501] Other sports such as golf, volleyball, skiing, cycling, swimming, badminton, tennis, bowling, and the study of martial arts are all widely enjoyed at the youth and amateur levels.[502] Great achievements in Canadian sports are recognized by Canada's Sports Hall of Fame.[503] There are numerous other sport \"halls of fame\" in Canada, such as the Hockey Hall of Fame.[503]  Canada shares several major professional sports leagues with the United States.[504] Canadian teams in these leagues include seven franchises in the National Hockey League, as well as three Major League Soccer teams and one team in each of Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association. Other popular professional competitions include the Canadian Football League, National Lacrosse League, the Canadian Premier League, and the various curling tournaments sanctioned and organized by Curling Canada.[505]  Canada has enjoyed success both at the Winter Olympics and at the Summer Olympics[506]\u2014though, particularly, the Winter Games as a \"winter sports nation\"\u2014and has hosted several high-profile international sporting events such as the 1976 Summer Olympics,[507] the 1988 Winter Olympics,[508] the 2010 Winter Olympics,[509][510] and the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup.[511] Most recently, Canada hosted the 2015 Pan American Games and 2015 Parapan American Games in Toronto.[512] The country is scheduled to co-host the 2026 FIFA World Cup alongside Mexico and the United States.[513]  Overview  Culture  Demography and statistics  Economy  Foreign relations and military  Geography and environment  Government and law  History  Social welfare  Overviews  Government  Travel    60\u00b0N 110\u00b0W\ufeff \/ \ufeff60\u00b0N 110\u00b0W\ufeff \/ 60; -110 "},{"title":"Rugby league","content":"  Rugby league football, commonly known as rugby league in English-speaking countries and rugby XIII in non-Anglophone Europe and South America, and referred to colloquially as rugby, football, footy or league in its heartlands, is a full-contact sport played by two teams of thirteen players on a rectangular field measuring 68\u00a0m (74\u00a0yd) wide and 112\u2013122\u00a0m (122\u2013133\u00a0yd) long with H-shaped posts at both ends.[1] It is one of the two major codes of rugby football, the other being rugby union.[a] It originated in 1895 in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, England, as the result of a split from the Rugby Football Union (RFU) over the issue of payments to players.[2] The rules of the game governed by the new Northern Rugby Football Union progressively changed from those of the RFU with the specific aim of producing a faster and more entertaining game to appeal to spectators, on whose income the new organisation and its members depended.  In rugby league, points are scored by carrying an oval ball and touching it to the ground beyond the opposing team's goal line; this is called a try, and is the primary method of scoring, worth four points. The opposing team attempts to stop the attacking side scoring points by tackling the player carrying the ball and denying forward progress. On occasion, where a clear try scoring opportunity has been thwarted by foul play, a penalty try may be awarded without the ball being grounded over the try line. In addition to tries, points can be scored by kicking goals. Field goals or drop goals can be attempted from the hand at any time for a single point, and following a successful try, the scoring team gains a free kick to try at goal with a conversion worth a further two points.[3] Penalty kicks at goal, known simply as penalties, may also be awarded for general foul play, and are also worth two points. Unlike drop goals, penalty kicks and conversions are taken from the ground, with the ball usually set in a kicking tee, and the opposing team not allowed to directly challenge the kicker.  The Super League in Europe and the National Rugby League (NRL) in Australasia are the world's premier club competitions. Globally, rugby league is played internationally, predominantly by European, Australasian, and Pacific Island countries, and is governed by the International Rugby League. Rugby league is the national sport of Papua New Guinea and the Cook Islands[4][5][6] and is a popular sport in countries such as England,[7] Australia,[8] New Zealand, France, Tonga, Fiji, Samoa.[9]  The first Rugby League World Cup was held in France in 1954, the first World Cup of either rugby code, and has been held sporadically ever since, settling into a four-yearly cycle in the 2010's; as of 2023[update], the holders are Australia.[10]  A short-sided version of the sport, rugby league nines, using modified rugby league rules also exists, and is comparable to rugby sevens. Wheelchair rugby league is a mixed-gender sport using heavily modified rugby league rules for disabled and able-bodied players. Unlike wheelchair rugby which adopted its name after the invention of the sport previously called murderball and is not directly linked to rugby union, wheelchair rugby league has grown out of the parent sport, and retains key aspects of that sport such as an egg shaped ball, the forward-pass rule and conversions. While not a Paralympic sport, the sport has its own Wheelchair Rugby League World Cup. A further variation for ambulatory disabled players, physical disability rugby league, was created and had its first world cup in 2022 to coincide with the rescheduled 2021 Rugby League World Cup competitions.  Rugby league football takes its name from the bodies that split to create a new form of rugby, distinct from that run by the Rugby Football Unions, in Britain, Australia, and New Zealand between 1895 and 1908.  The first of these, the Northern Rugby Football Union, was established in 1895 as a breakaway faction of England's Rugby Football Union (RFU). Both organisations played the game under the same rules at first, although the Northern Union began to modify rules almost immediately, thus creating a new simpler game that was intended to be a faster-paced form of rugby football. Similar breakaway factions split from RFU-affiliated unions in Australia and New Zealand in 1907 and 1908, renaming themselves \"rugby football leagues\" and introducing Northern Union rules.[11] In 1922, the Northern Union also changed its name to the Rugby Football League[12] and thus over time the sport itself became known as \"rugby league\" football.  In 1895, a schism in Rugby football resulted in the formation of the Northern Rugby Football Union (NRFU).[13] The success of working class northern teams led to some compensating players who otherwise would be on their job and earning income on Saturdays. This led to the RFU reacting to enforce the amateur principle of the sport, preventing \"broken time payments\" to players who had taken time off work to play rugby. Northern teams typically had more working class players (coal miners, mill workers etc.) who could not afford to play without this compensation, in contrast to affluent southern teams who had other sources of income to sustain the amateur principle.[2] In 1895, a decree by the RFU banning the playing of rugby at grounds where entrance fees were charged led to twenty-two clubs (including Stockport, who negotiated by telephone) meeting at the George Hotel, Huddersfield, on 29 August 1895 and forming the \"Northern Rugby Football Union\".[14] Within fifteen years of that first meeting in Huddersfield, more than 200 RFU clubs had left to join the rugby league.  In 1897, the line-out was abolished[15] and in 1898 professionalism introduced.[16] In 1906, the Northern Union changed its rules, reducing teams from 15 to 13 a side and replacing the ruck formed after tackles with the play-the-ball. By this point, rule changes meant the game organised by the RFL was distinct as a sport from its union cousin.[17]  A similar schism to that which occurred in England took place in Sydney, Australia. There, on 8 August 1907 the New South Wales Rugby Football League was founded at Bateman's Hotel in George Street.[18] Unlike in England, where both codes maintained their own geographic areas of dominance, in Australia rugby league went on to displace rugby union entirely as the primary football code in New South Wales and Queensland, while Australian rules football dominated in Victoria.[19]  On 5 May 1954, over 100,000 (official figure 102,569) spectators watched the 1953\u201354 Challenge Cup Final replay at Odsal Stadium, Bradford, England, setting a new record for attendance at a rugby football match of either code.[18] Also in 1954, the Rugby League World Cup, the first for either code of rugby, was formed at the instigation of the French. In 1966, the International Board introduced a rule that a team in possession was allowed three play-the-balls and on the fourth tackle a scrum was to be formed. This was increased to six tackles in 1972 and in 1983 the scrum was replaced by a handover.[20] 1967 saw the first professional Sunday matches of rugby league played.  The first sponsors, Joshua Tetley and John Player, entered the game for the 1971\u201372 Northern Rugby Football League season. Television had an enormous impact on the sport of rugby league in the 1990s, when News Corporation paid for worldwide broadcasting rights. The media giant's \"Super League\" movement created changes for the traditional administrators of the game. In Europe, it resulted in a move from Rugby League being a winter sport to a summer one, as the new Super League competition tried to expand its market. In Australasia, the Super League war resulted in long and costly legal battles and changing loyalties, causing significant damage to the code in an extremely competitive sporting market. In 1997 two competitions were run alongside each other in Australia, after which a peace deal in the form of the National Rugby League was formed. The NRL has since become recognised as the sport's flagship competition and since that time has set record TV ratings and crowd figures.[21]  The objective in rugby league is to score more points through tries, goals and field goals (also known as drop goals) than the opposition within the 80 minutes of play. If after two-halves of play, each consisting of forty minutes, the two teams are drawing, a draw may be declared, or the game may enter extra time under the golden point rule, depending on the relevant competition's format.  The try is the most common form of scoring,[22] and a team will usually attempt to score one by running and kicking the ball further upfield or passing from player-to-player in order to manoeuvre around the opposition's defence. A try involves touching the ball to the ground on or beyond the defending team's goal-line and is worth four points. A goal is worth two points and may be gained from a conversion or a penalty. A field goal, or drop goal, is only worth one point and is gained by dropping and then kicking the ball on the half volley between the uprights in open play. A field goal has a value of 2 points when kicked from beyond the 40 metre line. [23]  Field position is crucial in rugby league,[24] achieved by running with or kicking the ball. Passing in rugby league may only be in a backward or sideways direction. Teammates, therefore, have to remain on-side by not moving ahead of the player with the ball. The ball may be kicked ahead, but if teammates are in front of the kicker when the ball is kicked, they are deemed off-side.  Tackling is a key component of rugby league play. Only the player holding the ball may be tackled. A tackle is complete, for example, when the player is held by one or more opposing players in such a manner that he can make no further progress and cannot part with the ball, or when the player is held by one or more opposing players and the ball or the hand or arm holding the ball comes into contact with the ground.[25] An attacking team gets a maximum of six tackles to progress up the field before possession is changed over. Once the tackle is completed, the ball-carrier must be allowed to get to his feet to 'play-the-ball'. Ball control is also important in rugby league, as a fumble of the ball on the ground forces a handover, unless the ball is fumbled backwards. The ball can also be turned over by going over the sideline.  Rugby league and rugby union are distinct sports with many similarities and a shared origin. Both have the same fundamental rules, are played for 80 minutes and feature an oval-shaped ball and H-shaped goalposts. Both have rules that the ball cannot be passed forward, and dropping it forwards leads to a scrum. Both use tries as the central scoring method and conversion kicks, penalty goals and drop goals as additional scoring methods. However, there are differences in how many points each method is worth.  One of the main differences is the rules of possession.[26] When the ball goes into touch, possession in rugby union is contested through a line-out, while in rugby league a scrum restarts play. The lesser focus on contesting possession means that play focuses more on powerful running, hard tackling, forward progression and the contest for field position (commonly compared to an \"arm wrestle\"); as a result play stops much less frequently in rugby league,[27] with the ball typically in play for 50 out of the 80 minutes compared to around 35 minutes for professional rugby union.[28] Other differences include that there are fewer players in rugby league (13 compared to 15)[29][30] and different rules for tackling. Rugby union has more detailed rules than rugby league[31][32] and has changed less since the 1895 schism.[33]  Since rugby union turned professional in the mid-1990s, it has increasingly borrowed techniques, tactics and even laws from rugby league, while high profile players and coaches from the league game have increasingly gone on to success in the union code in those countries where both codes are popular (e.g. Andy Farrell, Jason Robinson and Henry Paul).[34][35] The inherent similarities between rugby league and rugby union have at times led to experimental hybrid games being played that use a mix of the two sports' rules.[36][37]  Much more so than rugby union, rugby league shares significant similarities with North American gridiron codes. Although described as evolving from both rugby and association football, the basic structures of American and Canadian football are remarkably similar to rugby league through a process of parallel evolution: a try-and-goal based scoring system, a set number of plays before handover of the football, each play restarting from a set piece position and ended by a tackle. Although the Canadian Football League in particular maintained the word 'rugby' in its name for many years, alluding to that shared past, the introduction of the forward pass and unlimited substitution in North American games created a fundamentally different species of game from either original rugby code. Although the historic link between the codes continues to be acknowledged, neither Canadian or American football is commonly considered a rugby code today except in the broadest sense, and are more commonly referred to collectively as gridrion codes, or simply as 'football' within their respective countries.  Players on the pitch are divided into forwards and backs, although the game's rules apply to all players the same way. Each position has a designated number to identify himself from other players. These numbers help to identify which position a person is playing. The system of numbering players is different depending on which country the match is played in. In Australia and New Zealand, each player is usually given a number corresponding to their playing position on the field. However, since 1996 European teams have been able to grant players specific squad numbers, which they keep without regard to the position they play, similarly to association football.[38]  Substitutes (generally referred to as \"the bench\") are allowed in the sport, and are typically used when a player gets tired or injured, although they can also be used tactically. Each team is currently allowed four substitutes, and in Australia and New Zealand, these players occupy shirt numbers 14 to 22.[39] There are no limitations on which players must occupy these interchangeable slots. Generally, twelve interchanges are allowed in any game from each team, although in the National Rugby League, this was reduced to ten prior to the 2008 season[40] and further reduced to eight prior to the 2016 season. If a team has to interchange a player due to the blood bin rule or due to injury, and this was the result of misconduct from the opposing team, the compromised team does not have to use one of its allocated interchanges to take the player in question off the field.  The backs are generally smaller, faster and more agile than the forwards. They are often the most creative and evasive players on the field, relying on running, kicking and handling skills, as well as tactics and set plays, to break the defensive line, instead of brute force. Generally forwards play a more collision oriented game, making ground by pure strength, and tackling near the play-the-ball.  Usually, the stand-off\/five-eighth and scrum-half\/half-back are a team's creative unit or 'playmakers'. During the interactions between a team's 'key' players (five-eighth, half-back, fullback, lock forward, and hooker), the five-eighth and half-back will usually be involved in most passing moves. These two positions are commonly called the \"halves\".  The forwards' two responsibilities can be broken into \"normal play\" and \"scrum play\". For information on a forward's role in the scrum see rugby league scrummage. Forward positions are traditionally named after the player's position in the scrum yet are equal with respect to \"normal play\" with the exception of the hooker. Forward positions are traditionally assigned as follows:  Rugby league is played in over 70 nations throughout the world. Papua New Guinea is the only country to have rugby league as its national sport.[41] Four countries \u2013 Australia, England, France, and New Zealand \u2013 have teams that play at a professional level. 45 national teams are ranked by the RLIF and a further 32 are officially recognized and unranked.[42] The strongest rugby league nations are Australia, England, New Zealand, Samoa and Tonga.  The Rugby League World Cup is the highest form of representative rugby league. Countries that have contested are Australia, Cook Islands, England, Fiji, France, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Lebanon, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Russia, Samoa, Scotland, South Africa, Tonga, US and Wales. The 2021 Rugby League World Cup, which was hosted by England during October and November 2022, staged the Men's, Women's and Wheelchair competitions together for the first time.[43] The competition currently features 16 teams.  The Asia-Pacific Rugby League Confederation's purpose is to spread the sport of rugby league throughout their region along with other governing bodies such as the ARL and NZRL.[44] Since rugby league was introduced to Australia in 1908, it has become the largest television sport and 3rd most attended sport in Australia.[45] Neighbouring Papua New Guinea is one of two countries to have rugby league as its national sport (with Cook Islands).[5][6] Australia's elite club competition also features a team from Auckland, New Zealand's biggest city. Rugby league is the dominant winter sport in the eastern Australian states of New South Wales and Queensland.[46] The game is also among the predominant sports of Tonga[47] and is played in other Pacific nations such as Samoa and Fiji. Researchers have found that rugby league has been able to help with improving development in the islands.[48] In Australia, and indeed the rest of the region, the annual State of Origin series ranks among the most popular sporting events.[49][50]  The Rugby League European Federation are responsible for developing rugby league in Europe and the Northern Hemisphere.[51]  In England, rugby league has traditionally been associated with the historic northern counties of Yorkshire, Lancashire, and Cumberland, where the game originated, especially in towns and cities along the M62 corridor.[7] Its popularity has also increased elsewhere.[52][53][54] As of 2024[update], only two of the twelve Super League teams are based outside of these traditional counties: Catalans Dragons and London Broncos. One other team from outside the United Kingdom, Toulouse Olympique, competes in the British rugby league system, although not at the highest tier Super League level, but rather in the second tier Championship.  Super League average attendances are in the 8,000 to 9,500 range. The average Super League match attendance in 2014 was 8,365.[55] In 2018 average Super League match attendance was 8,547.[56] Ranked the eighth most popular sport in the UK overall,[57] rugby league is the 27th most popular participation sport in England according to figures released by Sport England; the total number of rugby league participants in England aged 16 and over was 44,900 in 2017.[58] This is a 39% drop from 10 years ago.[58] While the sport is largely concentrated in the north of England there have been complaints about its lack of profile in the British media. On the eve of the 2017 Rugby League World Cup final where England would face Australia, English amateur rugby league coach Ben Dawson stated, \"we're in the final of a World Cup. First time in more than 30 years and there's no coverage anywhere\".[59]  France first played rugby league as late as 1934, where in the five years prior to the Second World War, the sport's popularity increased as Frenchmen became disenchanted with the state of French rugby union in the 1930s.[60] However, after the Allied Forces were defeated by Germany in June 1940, the Vichy regime in the south seized assets belonging to rugby league authorities and clubs and banned the sport for its association with the left-wing Popular Front government that had governed France before the war.[60] The sport was unbanned after the Liberation of Paris in August 1944 and the collapse of the Vichy regime, although it was still actively marginalised by the French authorities until the 1990s.[60] Despite this, the national side appeared in the finals of the 1954 and 1968 World Cups, and the country hosted the 1954 event.[61][62] In 1996, a French team, Paris Saint-Germain was one of eleven teams which formed the new Super League, although the club was dissolved in 1997.[63] In 2006, the Super League admitted the Catalans Dragons, a team from Perpignan in the southern Languedoc-Roussillon region.[64] They have subsequently reached the 2007 Challenge Cup Final and made the playoffs of the 2008 Super League XIII season. The success of the Dragons in Super League has initiated a renaissance in French rugby league, with new-found enthusiasm for the sport in the south of the country where most of the Elite One Championship teams are based. In other parts of Europe, the game is played at semi-professional and amateur level.  As of 2023, there is no professional rugby league in North America. From 2017 to 2020, the Toronto Wolfpack were North America's only active professional Rugby League team, competing in the English Rugby League system. They won the 2017 Kingstone Press League 1 in their inaugural season and earned promotion to the 2018 Rugby League Championship. In 2019 The Wolfpack won promotion to the Super League, lasting only a few months before having to withdraw due to the ongoing worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. New ownership is currently trying to revive the club with matches against amateur clubs in the US and Canada. Beginning in 2022, the Ottawa Aces were scheduled to join the English league pyramid, becoming the only Canadian team in the system after the Wolfpack were denied re-entry. The club subsequently relocated to Penryn, Cornwall, and are now known as Cornwall R.L.F.C.[65]  In 2021, the North American Rugby League announced an attempt to be North America's professional championship, with Canadian club Toronto Wolfpack joining several USA Rugby League clubs, New York Freedom and Cleveland Rugby League to form the league's inaugural season. Several brand new clubs from Western USA were scheduled to join in 2022 but never played.[66][67] The new competition is sanctioned by Canada Rugby League, but not yet by the United States governing body. Unfortunately, while some exhibition matches were played in 2021 and 2022, NARL was defunct by 2023 [68]  The early 21st century has seen other countries take up the game and compete in international rugby league with the Rugby League European Federation and Asia-Pacific Rugby League Confederation expanding the game to new areas such as Chile, Canada, Ghana, Philippines, Czech Republic, Germany, The Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Spain, Hungary, Turkey, Thailand and Brazil to name a few.[69][70][71]  The two most prominent full-time professional leagues are the Australian National Rugby League and the British Super League (with teams from New Zealand and France respectively).  Other professional and semi professional leagues include Australia's Queensland Cup (which includes a team from Papua New Guinea) and NSW Cup, the British RFL Championship and RFL League 1, the French Elite One Championship and Elite Two Championship.  The Papua New Guinea National Rugby League operates as a semi-professional competition and enjoys nationwide media coverage, being the national sport of the country.  Three main variant sports of rugby league exist worldwide; Touch, OzTag, and League tag.  Touch (also known as touch football or touch rugby) is a variant of rugby league that is conducted under the direction of the Federation of International Touch (FIT). Though it shares similarities and history with rugby league, it is recognised as a sport in its own right due to its differences which have been developed over the sport's lifetime.  Touch is a variation of rugby league with the tackling of opposing players replaced by a touch. As touches must be made with minimal force, touch is therefore considered a limited-contact sport. The original basic rules of touch were established in the 1960s by members of the South Sydney Junior Rugby League Club in Sydney, Australia.[72]  OzTag is a non-contact form of rugby league, and can be seen as a variation of British tag rugby. Cronulla Sharks and St George Dragons halfback Perry Haddock introduced the sport in Australia while coaching the 1992 St George Jersey Flegg side. Together with Chris Parkes, the two took the sport to fields across Australia. Today, it is played by over 200,000 players in organised leagues across the country.  League Tag replaces tackling with the removal of one of two tags carried on an opponent's hips, attached directly to specific League Tag shorts with Velcro patches, but otherwise retains almost all other rules of traditional rugby league (such as kicking). A number of additional rules are also added relating to the specific issues associated with a tag based game.

Figure shown is the total attendance which is officially counted for both games.[73][74]** The official attendance of the 1954 Challenge Cup Final replay was 102,569. Unofficial estimates put the attendance as high as 150,000, Bradford Police confirming 120,000.  Other hand in ball games, including private school sports such as the Eton Wall Game are not usually referred to as rugby, which is considered specific to games evolved from the game played at the private Rugby School.[citation needed] "},{"title":"Comparison of American and Canadian football","content":"American and Canadian football are gridiron codes of football that are very similar; both have their origins partly in rugby football, but some key differences exist between the two codes.  Rugby football was introduced to North America in Canada by the British Army garrison in Montreal, which played a series of games with McGill University.[1] In 1874, the United States' Harvard University hosted Canada's McGill University to play the new game derived from rugby football in a home-and-home series.  When the Canadians arrived several days early, to take advantage of the trip to see Boston and the surrounding areas, they held daily practices. During this time, the Americans were surprised to see the Canadians kick, chase, and then run with the ball. Picking up and running with the ball violated a basic rule of the American game of the day; when the U.S. captain (Henry Grant) pointed this out to the captain of the Canadian team (David Roger), the reply was simple: Running with the ball is a core part of the Canadian game. When the American asked which game the Canadians played, David replied \"rugby\". After some negotiation, they decided to play a game with half and half Canadian\/U.S. rules. Thus, many of the similarities and differences between the Canadian and American games indeed came out of this original series where each home team set the rules. For instance, Harvard, because of a lack of campus space, did not have a full-sized rugby pitch. Their pitch was only 100\u00a0yd (91\u00a0m) long by 50\u00a0yd (46\u00a0m) wide (slightly less than the 53+1\u20443-yard width of the current regulation-sized field for American football).  Because of the reduced field, the Harvard team opted for 11 players per side, four fewer than the regulation 15 of rugby union. To generate more offense, Harvard also increased the number of downs from three, as set by McGill, to four. Furthermore, the Harvard players so enjoyed running with the ball, this rule was wholly adopted into all Harvard play following the two games with McGill. While the American team bested the Canadian (3\u20130 and a following tie game), both countries' flavours of football were forever changed and linked to one another. Both the Canadian and American games still have some things in common with the two varieties of rugby, especially rugby league, and because of the similarities, the National Football League  (NFL) had a formal relationship with the Canadian Football League  (CFL) between 1997 and 2008.[2]  Many, if perhaps not most, of the rules differences have arisen because of rules changes in American football in the early 20th century, which have not been copied by Canadian football. The major Canadian codes never abolished the onside scrimmage kick (see Kicker advancing the ball below) or restricted backfield motion, while the American college football (from whose code all American codes derive) did. Canadian football was later in adopting the hand snap and the forward pass, although one would not suspect the latter from play today. Additionally, Canadian football was slower in removing restrictions on blocking, but caught up by the 1970s so that no significant differences remain today. Similarly, differences in scoring (the Canadian game valuing touchdowns less) opened up from the late 19th century, but were erased by the 1950s. An area in which American football has been more conservative is the retention of the fair catch (see below). The American game's modern rules were developed by Walter Camp in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, whereas the modern Canadian game was devised by John Thrift Meldrum Burnside, whose Burnside rules, invented around the same time, were developed independently from Camp's rules.  In some regions along the Canada-U.S. border, especially western areas, some high schools from opposite sides of the border regularly play games against one another (typically one or two per team per season).[citation needed] By agreement between the governing bodies involved, the field of the home team is considered a legal field, although it is a different size from one school's normal field. In all but a few cases, the rules of the home team are followed throughout the game.[citation needed]  Many CFL players are Americans who grew up playing American football and cannot find a place in the NFL, or who prefer to play in the CFL; strict import quotas restrict the number of non-Canadian players. Furthermore, the classifications of import (non-Canadian) and non-import (Canadian) were highly restrictive and required a player to have been in Canada since childhood to qualify as a nonimport (i.e. a player cannot simply become a Canadian citizen and become a nonimport, nor can he arrive in Canada during high school or college; both scenarios would still have the player in question classified as an import and counted against the team's maximum); these restrictions were loosened beginning in 2014 so that anyone who had become a Canadian citizen at any time before signing with the league for the first time could qualify as a nonimport player. For individuals who played both American and Canadian football professionally, their career statistic totals are considered to be their combined totals from their careers in both the CFL and NFL. Warren Moon, for example, was the all-time professional football leader in passing yards after an illustrious career in both leagues. He was surpassed in 2006 by Damon Allen, who in turn was surpassed by Anthony Calvillo in 2011, both of whose careers were exclusively in the CFL, then Calvillo was surpassed by Drew Brees and Tom Brady, both of whom played their entire careers in the NFL.  Several important specific differences exist between the Canadian and American versions of the game of football:  The official playing field in Canadian football is larger than the American, and similar to American fields before 1912. The Canadian field of play is 110 by 65 yards (100.6 by 59.4\u00a0m), compared to 100 by 53+1\u20443 yards (91.4 by 48.8\u00a0m) in American football.  Since 1986, Canadian end zones are 20 yards (18.3\u00a0m) deep while the American end zones are 10 yards (9.1\u00a0m) deep. Canadian end zones were previously 25 yards (22.9\u00a0m), with Vancouver's BC Place the first to use the 20-yard-long end zone in 1983, and since 2016, the home of the CFL's Toronto Argonauts, BMO Field, uses an 18-yard-long (16.5\u00a0m) end zone.[4] Including the end zones, the American field is about 34% smaller than the Canadian field (87,750\u00a0sq\u00a0ft or 8,152\u00a0m2 for the Canadian field vs 57,600\u00a0sq\u00a0ft or 5,350\u00a0m2 for the American field), but the Canadian field occasionally has its end zone truncated at the corners so that the field fits in the infield of a running track. Once a fairly common practice, the only example as of 2023[update] in the CFL is the Percival Molson Memorial Stadium, home of the Montreal Alouettes.  The goalposts for kicking are placed at the goal line in Canadian football, but at the end line in the American game professionally since 1974 (the college game has had them at the end line since 1927[5]). In Canadian rules, the distance between the sideline and hash marks is 24 yards (21.9\u00a0m); in 2022, the CFL narrowed the hash mark spacing to 9 yards (8.2\u00a0m).[6] In American amateur rules, at the high school level, the distance is 17\u00a0yards 2\u00a0feet 4\u00a0inches (16.3\u00a0m), virtually sectioning the field into three equal columns. The hash marks are closer together at the American college level, where they are 20 yards (18.3\u00a0m) from the sideline, and in the NFL, where they are 23\u00a0yd 1\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in (21.6\u00a0m) from the sideline and the distance between them is the same as that between the goalposts.[7]  Because of the larger field, many American football venues are generally unfit for the Canadian game. While several American stadia  could accommodate the extra 17+1\u20442\u00a0feet (5+5\u20446\u00a0yd or 5.3\u00a0m) per side in width (multipurpose stadia, baseball parks converted for football, and some soccer-specific stadiums are particularly good fits), most American stadia would lose between 15 and 18 rows of seating in each end zone because the field is 15 yards (13.7\u00a0m) longer on each end. In many smaller venues, this would be the entire end zone section, losing seating for at least 3,000 spectators.  During the CFL's failed expansion to U.S. cities in the early 1990s, Canadian football was either played on fields designed to accommodate both American football and baseball (such as the Baltimore Stallions playing at Memorial Stadium), or in some cases, on a field designed for American football (for instance, the Memphis Mad Dogs and the Birmingham Barracudas of the CFL, playing in the Liberty Bowl and at Legion Field, respectively, played the Canadian game on modified American-sized fields because of the inability of the stadia to adapt to the larger field). The Alamodome, originally built as a multipurpose dome, proved to best accommodate both Canadian football (the CFL's San Antonio Texans) and American football (Alamo Bowl, Dallas Cowboys training camp, the New Orleans Saints after Hurricane Katrina, the NFLPA Game, the U.S. Army All-American Bowl, and the UTSA Roadrunners), although Canadian football is no longer played there. Similarly, Hornet Stadium fairly easily adapted to both the Canadian and American games, as it was built with a running track in which the Canadian field fits with only some cuts to the corners. Hornet Stadium hosts California State University, Sacramento (more often known as Sacramento State), hosted the Sacramento Surge and Sacramento Mountain Lions in American football and the Sacramento Gold Miners in Canadian football.  American teams use 11 players, while Canadian teams have 12 players on the field per side. Both games have the same number of offensive players required at the line of scrimmage, so the 12th player in the Canadian game plays a backfield position on offence, whereas this is usually a defensive back on defence.[8]  Because of this, position designations of the various offensive and defensive lines vary. For example,  most formations in Canadian football have no tight ends, these having been phased out in 1980.[9] The typical offensive arrangement in Canadian football is three slotbacks instead of the American tight end and fullback while on the defensive end of the ball, two defensive halfbacks are used instead of one strong safety in the American game.[citation needed]  The sizes of individual American and Canadian footballs can vary within specified size limitations. Despite the CFL and NFL having different specifications until 2018, they overlapped to a sufficient degree that from at least 1985 forward, the same ball could fall within the requirements of both leagues.[citation needed]  Historically the CFL ball was slightly larger, both because of slightly bigger specifications, but also because CFL manufacturers tended to make balls at the larger end of the allowed tolerances as opposed to NFL manufacturers, which built balls to the smaller end. However, the CFL has updated its specifications twice\u2014first in 1985,[10] and most recently in 2018. The latter change saw the league adopt the NFL's specifications.[11]  Before it adopted NFL standards, the CFL's regulation football size was specified as short circumference from 20+7\u20448 to 21+1\u20448 inches (530 to 537\u00a0mm); long circumference from 27+3\u20444 to 28+1\u20444 inches (705 to 718\u00a0mm).[12]  The regulation size for an NFL football is specified as short circumference from 21 to 21+1\u20444 inches (533 to 540\u00a0mm); long circumference from 28 to 28+1\u20442 inches (711 to 724\u00a0mm).[13]  Despite the fact that before 2018, the CFL rules allowed for a smaller legal ball and the NFL rules allowed for a larger legal ball, a common misconception existed among media, fans, and even players that the then-current CFL ball was bigger. Some professional quarterbacks stated that they noticed a difference in size.[14]  Another difference between NFL and CFL balls is that Canadian balls have two 1-inch (25\u00a0mm) complete white stripes around the football 3\u00a0in (76\u00a0mm) from the largest diameter of the ball and NFL balls have no stripes at all. The CFL retained its striping scheme when it adopted NFL measurement specifications in 2018.[11] College football and high school football both specify the use of stripes, but only on two of the football's four panels (the ones adjacent to the laces). The original reason for adopting striped balls was to make them easier to see at night in an era when stadium lighting standards were far less rigorous compared to today.  In American football, a team has four downs to advance the ball 10 yards, while in Canadian football the limit is three downs.[15][16]  In both games, the ball is placed at a line of scrimmage, in which a player known as the \"centre\" or \"center\" performs a \"snap\" to start a football play. In Canadian football, the snap is required to go between the centre's legs; no such move is required in American football, but it is invariably done this way anyway, so the center is in position to block following the snap. The defensive team must stay a set distance away from the line of scrimmage on their side of the line.[citation needed]  In Canadian football, the distance between the line of scrimmage and the defensive team, formally called the \"scrimmage zone\", is one full yard.[17] Because of this one-yard distance, teams  tend to gamble on \"third and one\" or \"third and inches\". If a team's offense is within one yard of either goal line, the line of scrimmage is moved to the one-yard line.[18]  In American football, the set distance between the offensive and defensive teams, known in that code as the \"neutral zone\", is 11 inches\u00a0\u2013 the length of the ball, creating the illusion of the teams being \"nose-to-nose\" against each other.  While large, relatively immobile offensive line players used to form a line that cannot be easily penetrated by the defense are valued in American football, the extra distance from the defensive team means Canadian football finds value in more nimble players on the offensive line.[19]  In American football, if a punt returner sees that, in his judgment, he will be unable to advance the ball after catching it, he may signal for a fair catch by waving his hand in the air, and forgo the attempt to advance. If he makes this signal, the opposing team must allow him to attempt to catch the ball cleanly; if he is interfered with, the team covering the kick will be penalized 15 yards. In contrast, Canadian football has no such rule; instead, no player from the kicking team, except the kicker or any player who was behind him when he kicked the ball, may approach within five yards of the ball until it has been touched by an opponent. If they do, a \"no yards\" penalty is called against the kicking team.[20]  Furthermore, in American football, the receiving team may elect not to play the ball if the prospects for a return are not good and the returner is not certain he can successfully catch the ball on the fly; American players are generally taught not to attempt to touch a bouncing football. If any member of the kicking team touches the ball after the kick is made, without an intervening touch by the member of the receiving team, the receiving team may elect to scrimmage the ball from that spot of first touching, regardless of anything else (other than a penalty) that happens during the rest of the play. If the kicking team gains possession of the ball during the kick before it is touched by the receiving team, the ball is then dead. Often, the ball hits the ground and is surrounded by players from the kicking team, who allow it to roll as far as possible downfield\u00a0\u2013  without going into the end zone\u00a0\u2013  before grasping or holding the ball against the ground. (If a punt bounces into the receiving team's end zone, it is dead, and a touchback is awarded.) However, if the ball touches a member of the receiving team without his gaining possession (a \"muff\"), then the ball can be recovered by either team (but cannot be advanced by the kicking team). If the kicking team recovers the ball, they regain possession and are awarded a first down at the spot of the recovery.[citation needed]  Following a fair catch in American football, the receiving team can elect a free kick (called a fair catch kick) from the spot the ball is received\u00a0\u2013  and if the kick goes through the opposite goal posts, a field goal is scored. Fair catch kicks are rarely attempted in the NFL and are usually unsuccessful (the last successful fair catch kick was in 1976). The fair catch kick is not allowed in college football.[citation needed]  In Canadian football, if the receiving team does not play the ball, the kicker, and any teammates behind the kicker at the time of the kick, can retrieve and advance the ball. This is further explained in the kicker advancing the ball section.[citation needed]  In American football, after all players are set, only one offensive player is allowed to be in motion, and he cannot be moving toward the line of scrimmage while the ball is snapped. The motion player must start from behind the line of scrimmage; players on the line cannot be in motion.[21]  In Canadian football, all offensive backfield players, except the quarterback, may be in motion at the snap; players in motion may move in any direction as long as they are behind the line of scrimmage at the snap. In addition, the two players on the ends of the line of scrimmage (generally wide receivers) may also be in motion along the line.[18] Many teams encourage this unlimited motion, as it can confuse the defence. It also provides receivers the advantage of a running start, as they can time their runs so that they cross the line of scrimmage at speed when the ball is snapped, allowing them to get downfield faster than receivers in American football, allowing for comparatively longer throws in the same amount of time after the snap or quicker throws for a given distance.[citation needed]  In American football, the offensive team must run a play within 25 seconds of the referee whistling the play in \u2013 except in the NCAA (college) and the NFL where teams have 40 seconds from the end of the previous play, or 25 seconds following a penalty or timeout. In Canadian football (at all levels of play), teams have 20 seconds after the play is whistled in regardless of the preceding situation.[22]  American football rules allow each team to have three timeouts in each half, and the NFL stops play for a \"two-minute warning\". However, NCAA football has no two-minute warning, but the clock stops on a first down until the ball is ready for play if the play ended in the field of play. In the CFL, each team has two time-outs a game, but cannot use both in the last three minutes of the game, while at lower levels of Canadian football, each team has two. Canadian football has a three-minute rather than a two-minute warning. Also, at all levels of Canadian football, the clock is stopped after every play during the last three minutes of each half. Once the referee has set the ball, the clock restarts if the last play ended with a runner tackled in the field of play.[citation needed]  Timing rules change drastically after the minutes warning in both leagues:  These timing differences, combined with the fewer downs available for the Canadian offence to earn a first down, lead to spectacularly different end games if the team leading the game has the ball. In American football, if the other team is out of timeouts, running slightly more than 120 seconds (two minutes) off the clock without gaining a first down is possible. In Canadian football, just over 40 seconds can be run off.[citation needed]  Canadian football retains much more liberal rules regarding recovery of the ball by members of the kicking team. On any kick, the kicker and any member of the kicker's team behind the kicker at the time of the kick may recover and advance the ball. On a kickoff, since every member of the kicking team must be behind the ball when it is kicked, this effectively makes all 12 players \"onside\" and eligible to recover the kick, once it has gone 10 yards downfield. On a punt or missed field goal, usually only the kicker is onside, as no one is behind the kicker. All of the players offside at the time of the kick may neither touch the ball nor be within 5 yards of the member of the receiving team who fields the kick; violation of this rule is a penalty for \"no yards\". The penalty for no yards is 15 yards if the kick is in flight and 5 yards if it has been grounded.[citation needed]  The American rules are similar for the recovery of kickoffs. Any member of the kicking team may recover the ball once it has touched an opponent or once it has gone 10 yards downfield and touched the ground. The ball is dead when recovered, though the kicking team is awarded possession at the spot of recovery.[citation needed]  The American rules differ from the Canadian ones for scrimmage kicks. In American rules, to recover a scrimmage kick (punt or missed field goal) and retain possession, the ball must be touched beyond the line of scrimmage by a member of the receiving team (defense). If the ball is touched by the receiving team and then recovered by the kicking team, the kicking team retains possession and is awarded a first down. If the receiving team has not touched the ball before the kicking team touches it, it is \"first touching\" as described above in fair catches and punt returns.[citation needed]  Additionally, members of the kicking team must allow the receiving team the opportunity to catch a scrimmage kick in flight. No distance is required; the NCAA revoked its rule of a 2-yard halo.[24] Once the scrimmage kick has touched the ground, the kicking team is free to recover, subject to the first touching rules.  In both codes, a scrimmage kick that is blocked and recovered by the kicking team behind the line of scrimmage is in play. The kicking team may then choose to either attempt another kick or try to advance the ball, but no turnover has taken place on the play (unless a member of the receiving team has control of the ball), and therefore, the kicking team either has to advance the ball to the first-down marker, or loses the down, which often results in a turnover on downs.[citation needed]  In Canadian play, if the ball is fumbled out of bounds, the play ends with possession going to the team to last contact the ball in bounds (after the ball has completely left the possession of the fumbling ball carrier). A loose ball may be kicked forward (dribbled) provided it is then recovered by a player who is onside at the time of said kick. The ball may not, however, be intentionally kicked out of bounds to gain possession, this is then treated as a scrimmage kick out of bounds and possession goes to the opposing team. Incidental contact with the foot does not count as kicking the ball out of bounds. In American play, when a ball is fumbled out of bounds, the last team to have clear possession of the football is awarded possession, unless the ball goes out of the back or side of the end zone.  A team may still lose possession after a fumble out of bounds if the fumble occurred on fourth down (third down in Canadian play) and the ball becomes dead short of the line to gain. Because of plays like the Holy Roller, the NFL changed its rule regarding advancing a fumbled ball on offense. If the offensive team fumbles in the last two minutes of either half, or on fourth down at any time, only the player who fumbled is allowed to advance the ball past the point of the fumble. If any other offensive player advances the ball toward the opponent's goal line, the ball is moved back to the spot of the fumble. If the fumble occurred on fourth down, the defensive team gains possession on downs unless the original fumble occurred after the line to gain had been reached.  In Canadian football, any kick that goes into the end zone is a live ball, except for a successful field goal or if the goalposts are hit while the ball is in flight. If the player receiving the kick fails to return it out of the end zone, or if the ball was kicked through the end zone, then the kicking team scores a single point (rouge), and the returning team scrimmages from its 35-yard line or, if the rouge is scored as a result of a missed field goal attempt, the receiving team may choose the last point of scrimmage. If a kicked ball in flight hits a post without scoring a field goal, there is no score, and the receiving team scrimmages from its 30-yard line. If the kick is returned out of the end zone, the receiving team next scrimmages from the place that was reached (or if they reach the opponents' goal line, they score a touchdown); in the amateur levels of the game, they are given the ball at their 20-yard line if the kick was not returned that far.[25]  Singles like this do not exist in American football; however, one point may be scored when a safety is scored during a conversion attempt, in contrast to the two points scored for safeties during other plays.[26]  American football also allows a defending team to advance a missed field goal; however, because of the absence of singles and the goalpost position at the back of the end zone, the return is rarely exercised, except on a blocked kick, or as time expires in the half or in the game (with the most famous recent example being Chris Davis' game-ending return of a missed field goal for the winning touchdown in the 2013 Alabama\u2013Auburn game). Most teams instead elect not to attempt a return and assume possession  \u2013 at the previous line of scrimmage in the NCAA and at the spot of the kick in the NFL. Since the goalpost is out of bounds, any nonscoring kick that strikes the goalpost is dead, and the receiving team takes over possession from the spot of the kick or their own 20-yard line, whichever is further from the receiving team's goal. Likewise, any kickoff or punt that either is kicked through the end zone, is kicked into the end zone and rolls out of bounds without being touched by a player, is touched in the end zone by a member of the kicking team without any member of the receiving team having touched it, or is downed in the end zone by a member of the receiving team, results in a touchback. The placement of the ball after a touchback varies by rule set and game situation. Under high school rules, the receiving team is awarded possession on its own 20-yard line in all situations. In the NCAA and NFL, the ball is moved to the 20-yard line following a punt, and to the 25-yard line following a kickoff, or free kick after a safety. Under NCAA and NFL rules, a kickoff or free kick after a safety that ends in a fair catch by the receiving team inside its own 25-yard line is treated as a touchback, with the ball moved to the 25. If a player of the receiving team fields a kickoff or punt in the end zone, he has the option to down it in the end zone (resulting in a touchback) or to try to advance the ball.[citation needed]  Following a successful field goal, in Canadian rules, the team scored upon has the option of receiving a kickoff, kicking off from its 35-yard line, or scrimmaging at its own 35-yard line (the CFL first instituted this rule in 1975, but eliminated this last option for the 2009 season, but it was reinstated for 2010).  [Some confusion as to whether this rule after field goals was changed again in 2019]. In American football, a kickoff is performed by the scoring team after every score, with the exception of safeties. The option for the scored-upon team to kick off after a touchdown exists in American amateur football, but it is very rarely exercised.[citation needed]  Canadian football retains the open-field kick as a legal play, allowing a kick to be taken from anywhere on the field. The open-field kick may be used as a desperation last play by the offense; realizing they are unable to go the length of the field, they advance part of the way and attempt a drop kick, trying to score a field goal, or recover the ball in the end zone for a touchdown.[27] Like a punt or missed field goal, the team receiving the kick is allowed a 5-yard buffer to recover the kick.  Conversely, the defence, facing a last-second field goal attempt in a tie game or game they lead by one point, often positions its punter and place-kicker in the end zone. If the field goal is missed, they can punt the ball back into the field of play and not concede a single. Multiple such kicks may be attempted on the same play. During the October 29, 2010, Toronto Argonauts game against the Montreal Alouettes, four kicks occurred in one play; after a Montreal missed field goal, the Argonauts punted from the end zone to about the 20-yard line. The ball was caught and immediately punted back to the end zone by Montreal to attempt a single, and finally the Argos punted, but failed to kick it out of the end zone, where the Alouettes recovered it for a touchdown.[28] [29]  American football only allows free kicks and scrimmage kicks made from behind the line of scrimmage; any kick beyond the line of scrimmage or after change of possession would result in a penalty.  (Some levels of American football allow the rare fair catch kick, which according to the NFL rules is neither a free kick nor scrimmage kick, but sui generis.)[citation needed]  In both American and Canadian football, a safety (or safety touch) awards two points to the defending team if the offensive team is brought down in their end zone. In American football, the team giving up the safety must take a \"free kick\" from their own 20-yard line. In Canadian football, the team being awarded the two points has the option of scrimmaging from their own 35-yard line, kicking the ball off from their own 35-yard line, or having the opposing team kick off the ball from their own 35-yard line. In 2009, the CFL changed the last option to be a kick-off from their own 25-yard line.[30]  In both games, after a touchdown is scored, the scoring team may then attempt one play for additional points. In Canadian football, this play is called a \"convert\", and in American football, it is formally called a try or attempt, although it is more commonly referred to as either a conversion, extra point, or point after touchdown (PAT).   The additional points may be earned through a kick or a play from scrimmage. If done via kick, the scoring team gains one point, and if done from a scrimmage, the scoring team gains two.[citation needed]  However, the position of the ball for attempts is different in the two games. Point-after-touchdown attempts are snapped from the following points (as of the 2015 season):.[citation needed]  Because the goalposts are on the goal line in Canada and the end line in the United States, a CFL kicker is at the same distance from the goalposts as an NFL kicker. Before the 2015 CFL season, that league used the 5-yard line for all attempts (for a 12-yard attempt), which meant that the Canadian kicker was closer to the goalposts than an American kicker at any level. Amateur Canadian kickers remain closer to their goalposts than their American counterparts.[citation needed] Also prior to 2015, the NFL's line of scrimmage for extra points was the 2-yard line (for a 20-yard attempt). In the American game, a small hashmark is denoted on the field of the line of scrimmage of an extra point kick in the middle of the 3-yard line in high\/school college football; in the NFL, this hashmark appeared in the middle of the 2-yard line; while as aforementioned, the line of scrimmage of the extra point kick was moved back in 2015, this hashmark still denotes the 2-point conversion's line of scrimmage. No such hashmark appears on the Canadian field.  According to the rules of both the NFL and NCAA, on conversion attempts, the ball is automatically spotted in the middle of the field at the appropriate scrimmage line unless a member of the kicking team expressly asks a referee for an alternative placement. Per the rules, the ball can be placed at another spot between the hash marks (especially for strategic positioning on a two-point conversion attempt) or at another spot further back from the 2-, 3-, or 15-yard line (not uncommon at lower levels of football, since as the season progresses, conditions may worsen toward the center of the field, especially at the spot from which the PAT is usually kicked; the kicker may thus request a spot where the footing is surer).[citation needed]  During conversions, the ball is considered live in the CFL, American collegiate football, Texas high schools, the now-defunct NFL Europa, and starting with the 2015 season the NFL itself. As such, this allows the defensive team to gain two points on an interception or fumble return should they reach the kicking team's end zone, or (in the CFL) one point should the defensive team make an open-field drop kick through the kicking team's goalposts. Conversely, in other levels of American football and amateur Canadian football, defensive teams cannot score during a try.[citation needed]  A small plastic tee, which can be 1\u00a0to 2 inches (25\u201351\u00a0mm) high (smaller than the kickoff tee), may be used for field goals and extra points in some leagues, including US high schools and Canadian amateur play. The NFL (and most other professional leagues) has never allowed the use of tees for extra-point kick attempts, having always required kickers to kick off the ground for such attempts (and for field goals; a rare exception for a U.S.-based pro league to allow the usage of such tees for such attempts was the original USFL in the 1980s).[31][32] In 1948, the NCAA authorized the use of the small rubberized kicking tee for extra points and field goals, but banned them by 1989, requiring kicks from the ground, as in the NFL.[33][34] The CFL allows the use of a tee for field goals and convert kicks, but it is optional.[35]  In Canadian amateur football, the ball is not dead if a player kneels momentarily to, and does, recover a rolling snap, onside\/lateral pass, or opponent's kick, while in American amateur football, such a situation produces a dead ball, unless the player is the holder for a place kick. The holder is allowed to catch the snap or recover a rolling snap while on a knee to hold the kick and may also rise to catch a high snap and immediately return to a knee.[citation needed]  At professional levels in both games, unless it is a clearly willful kneel or slide by a ball carrier to go down, a player must be touched while on the ground, otherwise, the player may stand up and continue to advance the ball. Hitting a player who is kneeling, sliding, or clearly intends to run the ball out of bounds (especially quarterbacks) is generally viewed as unsportsmanlike and is often penalized, and in the most blatant of cases (especially if it happens in the dying seconds of a game), the player may be subject to off-field disciplinary action by their respective league governing body, usually in the form of fines or suspensions.[citation needed]  The procedures to settle games that are tied at the end of regulation vary considerably among football leagues.  Most leagues other than the NFL, including the CFL, use a procedure frequently called the \"Kansas Playoff\", so named because it was first developed for high school-football in that state. The rules are summarized here:  One aspect of the AAF overtime rules was unique to that league\u2014field goals were prohibited during overtime.  The NFL overtime is a modified sudden-death period of 15 minutes, for playoff games only; since the 2017 season, overtime periods in the preseason and regular season are 10 minutes, as part of an overall effort by the NFL to speed up games and reduce their length. If the team that receives the opening kickoff scores a touchdown, or the defensive team scores a safety, the game ends at that point. If the receiving team scores a field goal, the game continues with the scoring team kicking off, and the scored-upon team having a chance at possession. If that team scores a touchdown, or loses possession, the game ends; if it scores a field goal, overtime continues, with the next score by either team ending the game. In the regular season, if a game remains tied after the 10-minute period, it is declared a tie. In postseason games, there are multiple 15-minute periods until a winner is decided.  The overtime protocol of the second XFL, currently on hiatus, was significantly different from that of other leagues, being most similar to that used in US college football after that rule set's fourth overtime procedure:[37][38]  In American high school and college football, as well as at all levels of Canadian football, receivers need only have one foot in bounds (provided the player's other foot does not come down out of bounds until the catch is made) for a catch to count as a reception. NFL play requires receivers to get both feet on the ground and in bounds after making the catch for a reception to count. Up through the 2007 season, an NFL official could award a catch if it was judged that the receiver would have come down in bounds if he had not been pushed by a defender. This rule was based on a judgment call by the official, and was criticized for being inconsistent. The rule was dropped prior to the 2008 season by the NFL.[39]  CFL roster sizes are 46 players (rather than 53 as in the NFL, though only 45 will dress for a game). A CFL team may dress up to 44 players, composed of 21 \"nationals\" (essentially, Canadians), 20 \"internationals\" (almost exclusively Americans), and 3 quarterbacks.[40]  Player numbering schemes are similar in both Canadian and American football are similar, with Canadian rules being slightly less strict. In American football, players who wear numbers from 50 to 79 are, by rule, prohibited from catching or touching forward passes if their team is in possession of the ball and may not line up in a position that allows them to do so, unless explicitly indicated to the referee during a tackle-eligible play. In Canadian football, the ineligible numbers span only 50 to 69. Also, in the CFL the numbers 0 and 00, historically banned at all levels in American football, have long been available for use, other than for the aforementioned ineligible players. (Effective in 2023, a team cannot have players wearing 0 and 00 in the same game.) In the early 2020s, the rules were relaxed in American football to allow the number 0 in college and professional football, although 00 remains prohibited.  The traditional NFL football season runs from the second week of September until late December or the start of January, with the NFL playoffs occurring in January and February. In contrast, the CFL regular season runs from late June to late October. This is in order to ensure the Grey Cup playoffs can be completed in mid-November, before the harsh Canadian winters set in. This is an important consideration for a sport played in outdoor venues in locations such as Regina, Edmonton and Winnipeg.  In American football, officials typically use yellow penalty flags, while coaches' challenge flags are red. Before the 2022 CFL season, officials' penalty flags used in the CFL were orange in color, and challenge flags were yellow. Since then the CFL has adopted the NFL's flag colours. In American leagues, the referee wears a solid white cap, and the other officials wear black with white piping.[40] Until 2018 in the CFL, the referee wore a black cap with white piping, and the other officials wore white caps with black piping; starting with the 2019 season, the referee now wears a white cap with black piping, and the other officials wear black ones with white piping, almost mirroring the American convention (and matching the standard for the lower levels of the game in Canada). Additionally, when announcing penalties, in American football, the penalized team is announced using generic terms (\"offense\"\/\"defense\", for example), but in Canadian football (especially the CFL) the penalized team is announced by their respective city or province.  The CFL regular season comprises 18 games since 1986, with the exception of 2021, in which a 14-game schedule was used, while the NFL regular season has consisted of 17 games since 2021. There are several radical differences concerning how the leagues calculate regular season records and how ties in the standings are broken:  Although the rules of Canadian and American football have similarities, the differences have a great effect on how teams play and are managed.  The red zone is an unofficial term designating the portion of the field between the 20-yard line and the goal line. Due to the goalposts' being on the goal line in Canadian football, teams must avoid hitting the goalposts. Thus most touchdown throws are aimed away from the centre portion of the end zone. In the CFL, the goalposts have the same construction as the NFL posts, with the centre post being about 2 yards deep in the end zone. It is extremely rare for CFL passes to hit any part of the posts. When this occurs, a dead ball results. Occasionally, receivers can use the post to good effect in a 'rub' play to shed a defender. End zone passing becomes even more complicated when the corners of the end zone are truncated, as is the case at stadia where the field is bounded by a running track. However, the offensive team enjoys a counteracting advantage of end zones more than twice the size of those in American football (20 yards with a wider field), significantly expanding the area that must be covered by the defensive team and also allowing the freedom to run some pass patterns not available in American football's red zone. Moreover, the rule requiring only a single foot to be in bounds upon pass reception in Canadian football further stretches the amount of area that the offenses have to work with. NFL offenses generally try a run between tackles when on the one-yard line.  CFL offenses make similar attempts on first down on the one-yard line, but second and third down attempts, if required, can be much more varied than their NFL counterparts.[citation needed]  The frequency of punts is highly dependent upon the success, or lack thereof, of the offense. Punt returns are ubiquitous in Canadian football because the \"no-yards\" rule permits virtually every punt to be fielded and returned. Moreover, if the kicking team punts the ball out of bounds in an attempt to forestall a return and the ball goes out of bounds between the two 20-yard lines without touching the ground first, a 10-yard penalty is assessed and the ball advanced from where it left play, or the kicking team is backed up 10 yards and must replay the down.[41]  \"Shanked\" punts are therefore extremely costly to the kicking team. Though missed field goals may be returned in both national rule sets, the deeper end zone and goal post positioning make this much more common in Canadian rules. TSN on-air analysts state that they are the single play-from-scrimmage most likely to result in a touchdown. This set of special teams play (field goal return units) are rare in the American game to the point where a returner is not a standard part of a defensive field goal unit and will only be seen in unusual circumstances, with one especially notable example being the famous \"Kick Six\" college football game in 2013. Canadian kickoffs rarely result in a touchback, so special teams are more prominent in that area of the game as well. The difference in the games' final minutes procedures make comebacks\u2014and the need for an onside kick 'hands' team\u2014more prominent as well. The rule regarding last touch of the ball before leaving the play of field, rather than American football's last possession rule, makes the onside kick more likely to be successful as well. The most complex coaching job in Canadian football is said[by whom?] to be that of special teams co-ordinator. As many as 40 of a CFL roster of players may have a special teams role because of the wide variety of possible situations. In 2014 and 2015, the Edmonton Eskimos even used their third-string quarterbacks (Pat White in 2014 and Jordan Lynch in 2015[42]) as part of their kick and kick-coverage teams. This is highly unusual, as quarterbacks are generally discouraged from making contact plays. Kick returning was a duty generally handled by a player with another role, such as receiver or defensive back. Henry \"The Gizmo\" Williams[43] was the first player designated by telecasts as \"KR\" for a kicker returner position as his duties were almost entirely for that role, and referring to him as \"WR\" for wide receiver was increasingly seen as anachronistic. By far the greatest kick returner in professional football history, Gizmo Williams had more returns for touchdowns called back for infractions than any other player has ever scored (28: 26 punts, 2 kick-offs).  No NFL player has enjoyed similar success and the careers of such specialists (like Devin Hester) come nowhere near to matching the impact on the game that such players have in the CFL.[citation needed]  Canadian teams have only three downs to advance the ball ten yards compared to four downs in the American game. With one fewer down, Canadian teams must try for the big gain. For this reason, Canadian teams usually prefer passing over rushing to a greater extent than American, since pass attempts generally tend to gain more yards than rushing. This makes the action in Canadian football more open than is the case in the American game. Offensive drives (continuous possession of the ball) tend to be shorter.  Having three downs on a much longer and wider field with unlimited backfield motion results in Canadian teams requiring faster, more nimble athletes (comparatively) than their American counterparts. Paradoxically, this makes Canadian defense better at defending rushing plays. Rushing plays tend to be unlikely to produce a full ten-yard gain, and if correctly anticipated by the defense, much gain at all. The fewer downs means that an unsuccessful rushing play leaves an offense to have a single play to make comparatively longer first down yardage, so rushing plays are less favored unless the team on offense is actively managing the clock while maintaining the lead.  Pundits often like to claim that a Canadian team that rushes for 100 yards or more per game is likely to win, but the reality is winning teams rush the ball in defense of their leads, and not as a tactic to produce drives that lead to points unless they are markedly superior to their opponents. The larger field generally permits greater YAC (yards after catch) on each individual catch, where the NFL produces passing plays that either result in immediate tackles for relatively few YAC, or huge gains resulting from missed tackles or broken coverage.  In theory, an NFL team taking possession on their own one-yard line, using three downs for each first-down conversion and the full 40 second clock could run 27 plays and consume 18 minutes of clock time covering the 99 yards. A CFL team doing something similar (two plays per conversion, 20 second clock, average 10 seconds of clock time while the officials reset the ball between plays, 109 yards) would run 24 plays and consume 12 minutes of clock at the most.  One other notable difference is the propensity of CFL quarterbacks to rush the ball, both by design and as a result of reacting to the defense. Damon Allen[44] (the younger brother of Pro Football Hall of Fame running back Marcus Allen) had 11,920 rushing yards to go along with 72,381 passing yards in his 23-year career and actually sits third overall in career rushing yards. Contrast that with Randall Cunningham's 4928 yards over 16 seasons.[45] 1000-yard rushing seasons for CFL quarterbacks have occurred,[46] and 400-yard seasons for playoff-bound teams' starting quarterbacks, if they remain healthy for the entire schedule, are not unusual.[citation needed]  Perhaps the greatest difference arises due to the virtually unlimited movement allowed in the defensive and offensive backfields on a play from scrimmage in the Canadian game vs. very restricted offensive movement in the American game. Combined with the much larger field size, this difference changes the skillsets required of the athletes.  Canadian wide receivers, safeties and cornerbacks are far enough from the point where the ball is snapped that they rarely participate in rush offense or defense. Linebackers can be called upon to successfully defend running backs sent to receive passes. There is therefore a much greater premium placed on athletic speed, with former Edmonton Eskimos GM and former wide receiver Ed Hervey (6\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in\u00a0[183\u00a0cm], 195\u00a0lb\u00a0[88\u00a0kg], All-American at USC in the 200 meter) and Malcolm Frank[44] (5\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in\u00a0[173\u00a0cm] 170\u00a0lb\u00a0[77\u00a0kg]) being prototypical for the CFL. The offence has many more formation options and starting positions, forcing the defence to anticipate more possibilities. Seven of the 12 men on a CFL offense (typically the five linemen and the wide receivers) must be at the line of scrimmage at the time of the snap, and the other five must be at least one yard behind the line. Only the quarterback and linemen must be motionless at the time of the snap, allowing up to six players to be moving toward or along the line at varying speeds (typically the wide receivers are still or at a walking pace at the snap to ensure they are at the line of scrimmage.)[citation needed]  In both the college and pro games, an offensive team with the lead has more difficulty in running out the clock in the Canadian game.  In the Canadian Football League, the clock is stopped while the officials place the ball, and then they whistle the game clock and play clock to begin in the last minutes of a half; whereas in the National Football League the clock remains running while the officials set the ball (dependent upon the result of the previous play\u2014penalty, incomplete pass, out-of-bounds, or tackle inbounds in both leagues) while the play clock of 40 seconds runs down. The game clock only begins again when the play is whistled in, for an inbounds tackle, or at the snap of the ball for the other outcomes in the CFL. A team that is ahead has one fewer opportunity to kill clock time in the Canadian game with three downs, and can only take the play clock time (20 seconds) and the length of the play itself off the clock with each down. On the other hand, Canadian teams only receive one timeout per half, as opposed to three in American football. After the three-minute warning, a penalty of a loss of down (on first and second down, 10 yards on third down) results for failing to start the new play in time (time count violation).  Additionally, if a Canadian team commits a time count violation on third down, the referee has the right to require that it legally start a new play before the play clock expires, and can award possession to the defending team if another time count is committed. Moreover, in any quarter, when the game clock expires while the ball is dead in Canadian football, a final play must be run with \"zeros on the clock\" before the quarter ends, whereas in American football the expiration of time while the ball is dead immediately ends the quarter (including overtime periods in such cases where those periods are timed). In American football, it is common (or even, arguably, expected) for teams including coaching staffs and other such personnel to come on the field in order to shake hands, etc. before the game clock officially expires, especially in cases where the trailing team does not have possession of the ball, has no timeouts left and the result of the final play of the game left the clock running with less than forty seconds left.  The main caveats are that in all gridiron codes, a half cannot end on any penalty accepted by the non-penalized team even if there is no time remaining on the clock, and a team may always elect to attempt a conversion after a touchdown even if time is expired, so it is always possible for a final play to run with \"zeros on the clock\" under such circumstances. If a team that is trailing in the CFL can begin to produce two-and-outs on defense and efficient scoring drives on offense, 14 and even 17 points can be successfully scored in the final three minutes. This comeback proclivity is so pronounced that the CFL uses it for marketing purposes: No Lead Is Safe.[47] "},{"title":"Royal Belgian Football Association","content":"  The Royal Belgian Football Association (RBFA; Dutch: Koninklijke Belgische Voetbalbond; French: Union royale belge des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de football association; German: K\u00f6niglicher Belgischer Fu\u00dfballverband) is the governing body of football in Belgium. It was a founding member of FIFA in 1904 and UEFA in 1954 and was based in Brussels, not far from the King Baudouin Stadium. Since October 2021, the headquarters of the RBFA are located in Tubize, next to its technical centre. Its chairman is Robert Huygens\u00a0[nl].  The Association organizes the Belgium men's, women's, youth national teams, and national eSports team for FIFA.[1][2][3][4][5] It also runs the Belgian football league system, which includes the following competitions:  Each year, the executive committee of the Belgian FA honours deserving people with awards.[6]  These include (highest award first):  In the summer of 1986, when the national men's A-selection reached the semifinals of the World Cup in Mexico, the football team started the project Casa Hogar under impulse of RBFA delegation responsible Michel D'Hooghe. This is a home for street children in the industrial Mexican city Toluca, to which the football players donated part of their tournament bonuses. During 25 years, the RBFA stayed committed with this project and helped 500 children to meals and education.[7] "},{"title":"Single-elimination tournament","content":"A single-elimination, knockout, or sudden-death tournament, is a type of elimination tournament where the loser of each match-up is immediately eliminated from the tournament. Each winner will play another in the next round, until the final match-up, whose winner becomes the tournament champion. Each match-up may be a single match or several, for example two-legged ties in European sports or best-of series in North American pro sports. Defeated competitors may play no further part after losing, or may participate in \"consolation\" or \"classification\" matches against other losers to determine the lower final rankings; for example, a third place playoff between losing semi-finalists. In a shootout poker tournament, there are more than two players competing at each table, and sometimes more than one progresses to the next round. Some competitions are held with a pure single-elimination tournament system. Others have many phases, with the last being a single-elimination final stage, often called playoffs.[1]    In English, the round in which only eight competitors remain is generally called (with or without hyphenation) the quarter-final round; this is followed by the semi-final round, in which only four are left, the two winners of which then meet in the final or championship round.   The round before the quarterfinals has multiple designations. Often it is called the round of sixteen, last sixteen, or (in South Asia) pre-quarterfinals. In many other languages the term for these eight matches translates to eighth-final (e.g., in these European languages: \"huiti\u00e8me de finale\" in French, octavos de final in Spanish, Achtelfinale in German, \u00e5ttondelsfinal in Swedish, ottavi di finale in Italian, oitavos-de-final in Portuguese, optimi de final\u0103 in Romanian osmifin\u00e1le in Czech, osemfin\u00e1le in Slovak, and osmina finala in Serbo-Croatian), though this term is rare in English itself, with noticeable use in American debate tournaments.   The round before the round of sixteen is sometimes called round of thirty-two in English. Terms for this in other languages generally translate as \"sixteenth final\".   Earlier rounds are typically numbered counting forwards from the first round, or by the number of remaining competitors. If some competitors get a bye, the round at which they enter may be named the first round, with the earlier matches called a preliminary round, qualifying round, opening round, or the play-in games.  Examples of the diverse names given to concurrent rounds in various select disciplines:  Notes:  The knockout round of the 2002 FIFA World Cup  tournament:  Without any additional matches, the only position a single-elimination tournament can reliably determine is first - for example, if sorting the numbers 1-4 ascending, if 4 and 3 meet in the first round, 3 and 1 will lose in the first round and 2 will lose in the second, selecting 4 as the largest number in the set, but insufficient comparisons have been performed to determine which is greater, 2 or 3.  Despite this, the candidate that loses in the final round is commonly considered to have taken second place (in this case, 2).  When matches are held to determine places or prizes lower than first and second, these typically include a match between the losers of the semifinal matches called third place playoffs, the winner therein placing third and the loser fourth. Many Olympic single-elimination tournaments feature the bronze medal match if they do not award bronze medals to both losing semifinalists. The FIFA World Cup has long featured the third place match (since 1934), though the UEFA Euro has not held one since the 1980 edition.  Sometimes, contests are also held among the losers of the quarterfinal matches to determine fifth to eighth places. In one scenario, two \"consolation semifinal\" matches may be conducted, with the winners of these then facing off to determine fifth and sixth places and the losers playing for seventh and eighth; those are used often in qualifying tournaments where only the top five teams advance to the next round; or some method of ranking the four quarterfinal losers might be employed, in which case only one round of additional matches would be held among them, the two highest-ranked therein then playing for fifth and sixth places and the two lowest for seventh and eighth.  The number of distinct ways of arranging a single-elimination tournament (as an abstract structure, prior to seeding the players into the tournament) is given by the Wedderburn\u2013Etherington numbers.[7] Thus, for instance, there are three different arrangements for five players:  However, the number of arrangements grows quickly for larger numbers of players and not all of them are commonly used.  Opponents may be allocated randomly (such as in the FA Cup); however, since the \"luck of the draw\" may result in the highest-rated competitors being scheduled to face each other early in the competition, seeding is often used to prevent this. Brackets are set up so that the top two seeds could not possibly meet until the final round (should both advance that far), none of the top four can meet prior to the semifinals, and so on. If no seeding is used, the tournament is called a random knockout tournament.  Standard seeding pairs the highest and lowest, then second highest and second lowest and so on, for an 8 seed tournament this is 1 v 8, 2 v 7, 3 v 6 and 4 v 5, for example this is used for 16 seeds in the World Snooker Championship and 32 seeds in the World Darts Championship. Some tournaments stray from this, for example it is not the procedure that is followed in most tennis tournaments, where the 1 and 2 seeds are placed in separate brackets, but then the 3 and 4 seeds are assigned to their brackets randomly, and so too are seeds 5 through 8, and so on. This may result in some brackets consisting of stronger players than other brackets, and since only the top 32 players of 128 are seeded in Tennis Grand Slam tournaments, it can happen that the 33rd-best player in a 128-player field could end up playing the top seed in the first round. An example of this occurring was when World No. 33 Florian Mayer was drawn against, and defeated by, World No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the first round of the 2013 Wimbledon Championships,[8] in what was also a rematch of a quarter-final from the  previous year.[9]  Sometimes the remaining competitors in a single-elimination tournament will be \"re-seeded\" so that the highest surviving seed is made to play the lowest surviving seed in the next round, the second-highest plays the second-lowest, etc. This may be done after each round, or only at selected intervals. In American team sports, for example, the NFL employs this tactic, but MLS, NHL and the NBA do not (and neither does the NCAA college basketball tournament). Although MLB does have enough teams (12) in its playoff tournament where re-seeding would have made a large difference in the matchups; only the WNBA's at the minimum, which is at least four from each conference for a total of 8. The NBA's format calls for the winner of the first-round series between the first and eighth seeds (within each of the two conferences the league has) to face the winner of the first-round series between the fourth and fifth seeds in the next round, even if one or more of the top three seeds had been upset in their first-round series; critics have claimed that this gives a team fighting for the fifth and sixth seeding positions near the end of the regular season an incentive to tank (deliberately lose) games, so as to finish sixth and thus avoid a possible match-up with the top seed until one round later. MLS' format is identical, except that the conference quarterfinals is a best-of-three series.   In some situations, a seeding restriction may be implemented; from 1975 until 1989 in the NFL, and from 1994 until 2011 in MLB there was a rule where at the conference or league semifinal, should the top seed and last seed (wild card) be from the same division, they cannot play each other; in that case, the top seed plays the worst division champion; the second-best division champion plays the wild card team. This is due to the scheduling employed for the regular season, in which a team faces any given divisional opponent more often than any given non-divisional opponent \u2013 the tournament favors match-ups that took place fewer times in the regular season (or did not take place, in some cases).[1]  In international fencing competitions, it is common to have a group stage. Participants are divided in groups of 6\u20137 fencers who play a round-robin tournament, and a ranking is calculated from the consolidated group results. Single elimination is seeded from this ranking.  The single-elimination format enables a relatively large number of competitors to participate. There are no \"dead\" matches (perhaps excluding \"classification\" matches), and no matches where one competitor has more to play for than the other.  The format is less suited to games where draws are frequent. In chess, each fixture in a single-elimination tournament must be played over multiple matches, because draws are common, and because white has an advantage over black. In association football, games ending in a draw may be settled in extra time and eventually by a penalty shootout or by replaying the fixture.  Another perceived disadvantage is that most competitors are eliminated after relatively few games. Variations such as the double-elimination tournament allow competitors a single loss while remaining eligible for overall victory. However, losing one game requires the competitor to win more games in order to win the tournament.  In a random knockout tournament (single-elimination without any seeding), awarding the second place to the loser of the final is unjustified: any of the competitors knocked out by the tournament winner might have been the second strongest one, but they never got the chance to play against the losing finalist. In general, it is only fair to use a single-elimination tournament to determine first place. To fairly determine lower places requires some form of round-robin in which each player\/team gets the opportunity to face every other player\/team.  Also, if the competitors' performance is variable, that is, it depends on a small, varying factor in addition to the actual strength of the competitors, then not only will it become less likely that the strongest competitor actually wins the tournament, in addition the seeding done by the tournament organizers will play a major part in deciding the winner.[10][11] As a random factor is always present in a real-world competition, this might easily cause accusations of unfairness.  Variations of the single-elimination tournament include:  Other common tournament types include: "},{"title":"Rugby union","content":"  Rugby union football, commonly known simply as rugby union or more often just rugby, is a close-contact team sport that originated at Rugby School in England in the first half of the 19th century. Rugby is simply based on running with the ball in hand. In its most common form, a game is played between two teams of 15 players each, using an oval-shaped ball on a rectangular field called a pitch. The field has H-shaped goalposts at both ends.  Rugby union is a popular sport around the world, played by people regardless of gender, age or size.[3] In 2023, there were more than 10\u00a0million people playing worldwide, of whom 8.4\u00a0million were registered players. World Rugby, previously called the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) and the International Rugby Board (IRB), has been the governing body for rugby union since 1886, and currently has 116 countries as full members and 18 associate members.  In 1845, the first laws were written by students attending Rugby School; other significant events in the early development of rugby include the decision by Blackheath F.C. to leave The Football Association in 1863 and, in 1895, the split between rugby union and rugby league. Historically rugby union was an amateur sport, but in 1995 formal restrictions on payments to players were removed, making the game openly professional at the highest level for the first time.[4]  Rugby union spread from the Home Nations of Great Britain and Ireland, with other early exponents of the sport including Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and France. The sport is followed primarily in Great Britain, Ireland, France, Georgia, Oceania, Southern Africa, Argentina, and in recent times also, Italy, Japan, South America, the United States, Canada and Eastern Europe.[5][6][7] , its growth occurring during the expansion of the British Empire and through French proponents (Rugby Europe) in Europe. Countries that have adopted rugby union as their de facto national sport include Fiji, Georgia, Madagascar,[8] New Zealand, Samoa, Tonga, and Wales.  International matches have taken place since 1871 when the first game was played between Scotland and England at Raeburn Place in Edinburgh. The Rugby World Cup, first held in 1987, is held every four years. The Six Nations Championship in Europe and The Rugby Championship in the Southern Hemisphere are other important international competitions that are held annually.  National club and provincial competitions include the Premiership in England, the Top 14 in France, the Bunnings NPC in New Zealand, the League One in Japan and the Currie Cup in South Africa. Other transnational club competitions include the United Rugby Championship of club teams from Ireland, Italy, Scotland, South Africa and Wales, European Rugby Champions Cup in Europe, and Super Rugby Pacific in Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands.  Primitive forms of football included harpastum, played by the Romans, where two opposing teams competed to throw a large ball into an opposition net, fighting for possession of the ball. Medieval Irishmen played caid, carrying an inflated bladder and using arched trees as goals. The Welsh played an inter-parish game using a wooden ball called cnapan. Frenchmen played soule and Georgians played lelo. \"Football\" as a game was well established by 1803 at Rugby School and by the 1830s, \"running in\" with the ball in hand was allowed but subject to hacking and \"collaring\".[9] Former Rugby School student Albert Pell is credited with having formed the first \"football\" team while a student at Cambridge University.[10] Major private schools each used different rules during this early period, with former pupils from Rugby and Eton attempting to carry their preferred rules through to their universities.[11] A significant event in the early development of rugby football was the production of a written set of rules at Rugby School in 1845,[12][13] followed by the Cambridge Rules that were drawn up in 1848.[14]  Formed in 1863, the national governing body The Football Association (FA) began codifying a set of universal football rules. These new rules specifically banned players from running with the ball in hand and also disallowed hacking (kicking players in the shins), both of which were legal and common tactics under the Rugby School's rules of the sport. In protest at the imposition of the new rules, the Blackheath Club left the FA[15][16] followed by several other clubs that also favoured the \"Rugby Rules\". Although these clubs decided to ban hacking soon afterwards, the split was permanent, and the FA's codified rules became known as \"association football\" whilst the clubs that had favoured the Rugby Rules formed the Rugby Football Union in 1871,[15] and their code became known as \"rugby football\".  In 1895, there was a major schism within rugby football in England in which numerous clubs from Northern England resigned from the RFU over the issue of reimbursing players for time lost from their workplaces. The split highlighted the social and class divisions in the sport in England. Although the rules of the game were not a factor in the split, the breakaway teams subsequently adopted some rule changes and this became the separate code of \"rugby league\". The RFU's code thereafter took on the name \"rugby union\" to differentiate it from rugby league,[17] but both versions of the sport are known simply as \"rugby\" throughout most of the world.[18]  The first rugby football international was played on 27 March 1871 between Scotland and England in Edinburgh. Scotland won the game by one goal and one try to one goal.[15][19] By 1881 both Ireland and Wales had representative teams and in 1883 the first international competition, the Home Nations Championship had begun. 1883 is also the year of the first rugby sevens tournament, the Melrose Sevens,[20] which is still held annually.  Two important overseas tours took place in 1888: a British Isles team visited Australia and New Zealand\u2014although a private venture, it laid the foundations for future British and Irish Lions tours;[21] and the 1888\u201389 New Zealand Native football team brought the first overseas team to British spectators.[22]  During the early history of rugby union, a time before commercial air travel, teams from different continents rarely met. The first two notable tours both took place in 1888\u2014the British Isles team touring New Zealand and Australia,[23] followed by the New Zealand team touring Europe.[24] Traditionally the most prestigious tours were the Southern Hemisphere countries of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa making a tour of a Northern Hemisphere, and the return tours made by a joint British and Irish team.[25] Tours would last for months, due to long traveling times and the number of games undertaken; the 1888 New Zealand team began their tour in Hawkes Bay in June and did not complete their schedule until August 1889, having played 107 rugby matches.[26] Touring international sides would play Test matches against international opponents, including national, club and county sides in the case of Northern Hemisphere rugby, or provincial\/state sides in the case of Southern Hemisphere rugby.[23][27]  Between 1905 and 1908, all three major Southern Hemisphere rugby countries sent their first touring teams to the Northern Hemisphere: New Zealand in 1905, followed by South Africa in 1906 and Australia in 1908. All three teams brought new styles of play, fitness levels and tactics,[28] and were far more successful than critics had expected.[29]  The New Zealand 1905 touring team performed a haka before each match, leading Welsh Rugby Union administrator Tom Williams to suggest that Wales player Teddy Morgan lead the crowd in singing the Welsh National Anthem, Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau, as a response. After Morgan began singing, the crowd joined in: the first time a national anthem was sung at the start of a sporting event.[30][nb 2] In 1905 France played England in its first international match.[28]  Rugby union was included as an event in the Olympic Games four times during the early 20th century. No international rugby games and union-sponsored club matches were played during the First World War, but competitions continued through service teams such as the New Zealand Army team.[32] During the Second World War no international matches were played by most countries, though Italy, Germany and Romania played a limited number of games,[33][34][35] and Cambridge and Oxford continued their annual University Match.[36]  The first officially sanctioned international rugby sevens tournament took place in 1973 at Murrayfield, one of Scotland's biggest stadiums, as part of the Scottish Rugby Union centenary celebrations.[37]  In 1987 the first Rugby World Cup was held in Australia and New Zealand, and the inaugural winners were New Zealand. The first World Cup Sevens tournament was held at Murrayfield in 1993. Rugby Sevens was introduced into the Commonwealth Games in 1998 and was added to the Olympic Games of 2016.[38] Both men and women's Sevens took place at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.[39]  Rugby union was an amateur sport until the IRB declared the game \"open\" in August 1995 (shortly after the completion of the 1995 World Cup), removing restrictions on payments to players.[40][41] However, the pre-1995 period of rugby union was marked by frequent accusations of \"shamateurism\",[42] including an investigation in Britain by a House of Commons Select committee in early 1995.[43][44] Following the introduction of professionalism trans-national club competitions were started, with the Heineken Cup in the Northern Hemisphere and Super Rugby in the Southern Hemisphere.[45][46]  The Tri Nations, an annual international tournament involving Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, kicked off in 1996.[46] In 2012, this competition was extended to include Argentina, a country whose impressive performances in international games (especially finishing in third place in the 2007 Rugby World Cup) was deemed to merit inclusion in the competition. As a result of the expansion to four teams, the tournament was renamed The Rugby Championship.[47]  Each team starts the match with 15 players on the field and typically seven or eight substitutes but this varies at amateur level.[48] The 15 players on the field are divided into eight forwards (two more than in rugby league) and seven backs.[49] There are typically significantly more forwards on the bench than backs with, for example, South Africa having a 7-1 split in favour of forwards in their August 2023 match against New Zealand in Twickenham. A 6-2 or 5-3 split is more common.  The main responsibilities of the forward players are to gain and retain possession of the ball. Forwards play a vital role in tackling and rucking opposing players.[50] Players in these positions are generally bigger and stronger and take part in the scrum and line-out.[50] The forwards are often collectively referred to as the 'pack', especially when in the scrum formation.[51]  The front row consists of three players: two props (the loosehead prop and the tighthead prop) and the hooker. The role of the two props is to support the hooker during scrums, to provide support for the jumpers during line-outs and to provide strength and power in rucks and mauls. The third position in the front row is the hooker. The hooker is a key position in attacking and defensive play and is responsible for winning the ball in the scrum. Hookers normally throw the ball in at line-outs.[49][52]  The second row consists of two locks or lock forwards. Locks are usually the tallest players in the team and specialise as line-out jumpers.[49] The main role of the lock in line-outs is to make a standing jump, often supported by the other forwards, to either collect the thrown ball or ensure the ball comes down on their side. Locks also have an important role in the scrum, binding directly behind the three front row players and providing forward drive.[49]  The back row, not to be confused with 'Backs', is the third and final row of the forward positions, who are often referred to as the loose forwards.[51] The three positions in the back row are the two flankers and the number 8. The two flanker positions, known as the blindside flanker and openside flanker, are the final row in the scrum. They are usually the most mobile forwards in the game. Their main role is to win possession through 'turn overs'.[49] The number 8 packs down between the two locks at the back of the scrum. The role of the number 8 in the scrum is to control the ball after it has been heeled back from the front of the pack, and the position provides a link between the forwards and backs during attacking phases.[53]  The role of the backs is to create and convert point-scoring opportunities. They are generally smaller, faster and more agile than the forwards.[50] Another distinction between the backs and the forwards is that the backs are expected to have superior kicking and ball-handling skills, especially the fly-half, scrum-half, and full-back.[50]  The half-backs consist of two positions, the scrum-half and the fly-half, also known in the Southern Hemisphere as half-back and first five-eighth respectively. The fly-half is crucial to a team's game plan, orchestrating the team's performance.[53] They are usually the first to receive the ball from the scrum-half following a breakdown, lineout, or scrum, and need to be decisive with what actions to take and be effective at communicating with the outside backs.[53] Many fly-halves are also their team's goal kickers. The scrum-half is the link between the forwards and the backs.[53] They receive the ball from the lineout and remove the ball from the back of the scrum, usually passing it to the fly-half.[54] They also feed the scrum and sometimes have to act as a fourth loose forward.[55]  There are four three quarter positions: two centres (inside and outside) and two wings (left and right). In the Southern Hemisphere, the inside centre is commonly referred to as the second five-eighth, while the outside centre is simply known as the centre. The centres will attempt to tackle attacking players; whilst in attack, they should employ speed and strength to breach opposition defences.[53] The wings are generally positioned on the outside of the backline. Their primary function is to finish off moves and score tries.[56] Wings are usually the fastest players in the team and are elusive runners who use their speed to avoid tackles.[57]  The full-back is normally positioned several metres behind the back line. They often field opposition kicks and are usually the last line of defence should an opponent break through the back line.[53] Two of the most important attributes of a good full-back are dependable catching skills and a good kicking game.[58]  Rugby union is played between two teams\u00a0\u2013 the one that scores more points wins the game. Points can be scored in several ways: a try, scored by grounding the ball in the in-goal area (between the goal line and the dead-ball line), is worth 5 points and a subsequent conversion kick scores 2 points; a successful penalty kick or a drop goal each score 3 points.[59] The values of each of these scoring methods have been changed over the years.[60]  According to World Rugby's Laws of the Game,[61] a typical rugby ground, formally known as the \"playing enclosure\", is formed by two major zones:  The referee (and their assistants) generally have full authority and responsibility for all players and other officials inside the playing enclosure. Fences or ropes (particularly at amateur clubs) are generally used to mark the extent of this area, although in modern stadia this may include the entire arena floor or other designated space.  The Laws, above all, require that the playing enclosure's surface be safe, whilst also permitting grass, sand, clay, snow or conforming artificial turf to be used; the surface would generally be uniform across both the playing area and perimeter area, although depending on how large the perimeter is, other surfaces such as dirt, artificial turf, etc. may be used outside of a \"sliding\" perimeter from the bounds of the playing area.  For the most part, the \"playing area\" is where the majority of play occurs. The ball is generally considered live whilst in this area, so long as players do not infringe, with special rules applied to specific zones of the playing area.  The playing area consists of:  A typical \"field of play\" is generally 100 metres long by 68\u201370 metres wide for senior rugby, depending on the specific requirements of each ground. The Laws require the field of play to be between 94 and 100 metres (103 and 109 yards) long, with a width of between 68 and 70 metres (74 and 77 yards).  As other football codes, such as association football and rugby league, have specified a preferred or standard 68 metre width, this is often used unless a ground has been specifically designed to accommodate a 70-metre rugby field. 100 metres is the typical length, with a line (see below) often marked at halfway with \"50\" on it, representing 50 metres from each goal line. The variations have been allowed in the Laws, possibly to accommodate older grounds (perhaps even pre-metrification when yards and feet were specified) and developing nations.  The field of play is divided by a solid \"halfway\" line, drawn perpendicular to the sidelines at their midpoint. A 0.5m line is marked perpendicular to the halfway lines at its midpoint, designating the spot where the kickoffs shall be taken. The areas between each goal line and the halfway line are known as \"halves\" as in other football codes.  A pair of solid lines are also drawn perpendicular to the sidelines, 22 metres (formerly 25 yards) from each end of the field of play and called the 22-metre lines, or \"22\"s. An area at each end, also known as the \"22\", is bounded by, but does not include, the sidelines, goal line and 22-metre line. In this area, a defensive player who cleanly catches a ball kicked by the other team, without the ball having already touched the ground after the kick, is entitled to claim a free kick, or \"mark\".  Additional broken or dashed lines (of 5 metre dash lengths, according to the Laws[62]) are drawn in each half or on each side of, the field, each with specific purposes under the Laws:  Generally, points where the dashed lines intersect other lines will be marked with a \"T\" or cross shape, although the extensions of dashed lines are generally not drawn within 5 metres of the goal lines or sidelines, to allow a clear demarcation of the field of play's boundaries.  The Laws require the playing area to be rectangular in shape, however variations may be permitted with the approval of relevant unions. A notable example is Chatswood Oval in Sydney, Australia, an elliptically shaped cricket ground which is the home of Gordon rugby club, that has curved dead-ball lines to maximise the available in-goal space.  Where multiple sports share a field (e.g. a rugby league and a rugby union club sharing one field), lines may be overlaid on top of each other, sometimes in different colours. However, particularly for television, rugby union line markings are generally painted white. Some exceptions include the Wallabies (Australia's national team) who often have yellow markings. Local clubs may use black, yellow, or other colours on grass, with other surfaces possibly requiring different marking techniques.  Unlike association football, where on-field advertising is strictly forbidden in the laws,[63] World Rugby allows sponsors logos to be painted on the playing surface. This is another way in which clubs can make money in the professional era and is also often used by host nations, professional leagues and tournaments as additional revenue streams, particularly when games are broadcast. In recent years, augmented reality technology has been used to replace painting to protect the surface or save costs on painting fields, producing a similar effect for broadcast albeit sometimes with poorer results.[64]  The in-goal areas sit behind the goal lines, equivalent to American football's \"end zones\". The in-goal areas must be between 6 and 22 metres (6.6 and 24.1 yards) deep and cover the full width of the field. A ball grounded in this area by an attacking player will generally result in a try being awarded, unless there has been a previous infringement, or the player has gone out-of-bounds whilst in possession of the ball.  The perimeter area is considered \"out-of-bounds\" for the ball and the players, normally resulting in the non-infringing team receiving possession of the ball at a restart. The perimeter area can be divided into two areas:  For the purposes of determining if a ball is \"out-of-bounds\" (i.e. has left the playing area), the perimeter area extends indefinitely away from the playing area.  When a ball or player goes into touch, a lineout throw is generally awarded to the opposition at the spot on the sideline where they left the field. Exceptions include a kick out \"on the full\" (i.e. the ball did not land in the field-of-play before going into touch) in which case the lineout would still take place on the sideline but back in line with where the ball was kicked, or when a team takes a free kick from a penalty where they would retain the right to throw-in.  The perimeter area should be clear and free of obstructions and heavy, solid objects which could pose a danger to players for at least 5 metres from the playing area, according to the Laws. Players often leave the playing area whether accidentally or due to being forced off of the field, sometimes sliding or needing to slow down from a sprint. Many venues at elite levels leave larger spaces around the field to accommodate fitter and faster (or heavier) players. Fixed cameras on tripods and advertising hoardings are often the main culprits for injuring players in the perimeter area.  Also required in the perimeter area are a set of 14 flag posts, each with a minimum height of 1.2 metres, marking the intersections of certain lines or other nominated distances. These are generally a plastic pole on a spring loaded or otherwise soft base, sometimes with a flag on top, covered in foam padding. Others may be moulded plastic or disposable cardboard. At lower levels, these flags may not be used, but are still specified in the Laws. Flags are placed as follows:  Rugby goalposts are H-shaped and are situated in the middle of the goal lines at each end of the field. They consist of two vertical poles (known as \"uprights\"), generally made of steel or other metal but sometimes wood or a plastic, 5.6 metres (6.1\u00a0yd) apart, connected by a horizontal \"crossbar\" 3 metres (3.3\u00a0yd) above the ground. The minimum height for posts' uprights is 3.4 metres (3.7\u00a0yd),[65] with taller posts generally seen. The bottom parts of each upright are generally wrapped in purpose-made padding to protect players from injury when coming into contact with the posts and creating another opportunity for sponsors. Until a Law change by World Rugby in 2020, it was possible for an attacking player to score a try by grounding the ball against the base of the upright as the padding was considered an extension of the goal line.[66]  At the beginning of the game, the captains and the referee toss a coin to decide which team will kick off first. Play then starts with a dropkick, with the players chasing the ball into the opposition's territory, and the other side trying to retrieve the ball and advance it. The dropkick must make contact with the ground before being kicked. If the ball does not reach the opponent's 10-metre (11-yard) line 10 meters away, the opposing team has two choices: to have the ball kicked off again, or to have a scrum at the centre of the half-way line.[67] If the player with the ball is tackled, frequently a ruck will result.[68]  Games are divided into 40-minute halves, with an intermission of not more than 15 minutes in the middle.[69] The sides exchange ends of the field after the half-time break.[69] Stoppages for injury or to allow the referee to take disciplinary action do not count as part of the playing time, so that the elapsed time is usually longer than 80 minutes.[69] The referee is responsible for keeping time, even when\u2014as in many professional tournaments\u2014he is assisted by an official time-keeper.[69] If time expires while the ball is in play, the game continues until the ball is \"dead\", and only then will the referee blow the whistle to signal half-time or full-time; but if the referee awards a penalty or free-kick, the game continues.[69]  In the knockout stages of rugby competitions, most notably the Rugby World Cup, two extra time periods of 10 minutes periods are played (with an interval of 5 minutes in between) if the game is tied after full-time. If scores are level after 100 minutes then the rules call for 20 minutes of sudden-death extra time to be played. If the sudden-death extra time period results in no scoring a kicking competition is used to determine the winner. However, no match in the history of the Rugby World Cup has ever gone past 100 minutes into a sudden-death extra time period.[70]  Forward passing (throwing the ball ahead to another player) is not allowed; the ball can be passed laterally or backwards.[71] The ball tends to be moved forward in three ways\u2014by kicking, by a player running with it or within a scrum or maul. Only the player with the ball may be tackled or rucked. A \"knock-on\" is committed when a player knocks the ball forward, and play is restarted with a scrum.[71]  Any player may kick the ball forward in an attempt to gain territory. When a player anywhere in the playing area kicks indirectly into touch so that the ball first bounces in the field of play, the throw-in is taken where the ball went into touch.[72] If the player kicks directly into touch (i.e. without bouncing in-field first) from within one's own 22-metre (24-yard) line, the lineout is taken by the opposition where the ball went into touch, but if the ball is kicked into touch directly by a player outside the 22-metre (24-yard) line, the lineout is taken level to where the kick was taken.[72]  The aim of the defending side is to stop the player with the ball, by tackling them, and either bringing them to ground (which is frequently followed by a ruck) or contesting for possession with the ball-carrier on their feet (a maul). A ruck or maul is called a breakdown, and each is governed by a specific law.  Tackling  A player may tackle an opposing player who has the ball by holding them while bringing them to ground. Tacklers cannot tackle above the shoulder (the neck and head are out of bounds),[73] and the tackler has to attempt to wrap their arms around the player being tackled to complete the tackle. It is illegal to push, shoulder-charge, or to trip a player using feet or legs, but hands may be used (this being referred to as a tap-tackle or ankle-tap).[74][75] Tacklers may not tackle an opponent who has jumped to catch a ball until the player has landed.[73]  Rucking and Mauling  Mauls occur after a player with the ball has come into contact with an opponent but the handler remains on his feet; once any combination of at least three players have bound themselves a maul has been set.[51] A ruck is similar to the maul, but in this case the ball has gone to ground with at least three attacking players binding themselves on the ground in an attempt to secure the ball.[51]  When the ball leaves the side of the field, a line-out is awarded against the team which last touched the ball.[76] Forward players from each team line up a metre apart, perpendicular to the touchline and between 5 and 15\u00a0m (5.5 and 16.4\u00a0yd) from the touchline.[76] The ball is thrown from the touchline down the centre of the lines of forwards by a player (usually the hooker) from the team that did not play the ball into touch.[76] The exception to this is when the ball went out from a penalty, in which case the side who gained the penalty throws the ball in.[76]  Both sides compete for the ball and players may lift their teammates.[77] A jumping player cannot be tackled until they stand and only shoulder-to-shoulder contact is allowed; deliberate infringement of this law is dangerous play, and results in a penalty kick.[78]  A scrum is a way of restarting the game safely and fairly after a minor infringement.[79] It is awarded when the ball has been knocked or passed forward, if a player takes the ball over their own try line and puts the ball down, when a player is accidentally offside or when the ball is trapped in a ruck or maul with no realistic chance of being retrieved. A team may also opt for a scrum if awarded a penalty.[79]  A scrum is formed by the eight forwards from each team crouching down and binding together in three rows, before interlocking with the opposing team.[79] For each team, the front row consists of two props (loosehead and tighthead) either side of the hooker.[79] The two props are typically amongst the strongest players on the team. The second row consists of two locks and the two flankers. Behind the second row is the number 8. This formation is known as the 3\u20134\u20131 formation.[80] Once a scrum is formed the scrum-half from the team awarded the feed rolls the ball into the gap between the two front-rows known as the tunnel.[79] The two hookers then compete for possession by hooking the ball backwards with their feet, while each pack tries to push the opposing pack backwards to help gain possession.[79] The side that wins possession can either keep the ball under their feet while driving the opposition back, in order to gain ground, or transfer the ball to the back of the scrum where it can be picked up by the number 8 or by the scrum-half.[79]  There are three match officials: a referee, and two assistant referees. The referees are commonly addressed as \"Sir\".[81] The latter, formerly known as touch judges, had the primary function of indicating when the ball had gone into \"touch\"; their role has been expanded and they are now expected to assist the referee in a number of areas, such as watching for foul play and checking offside lines.[81] In addition, for matches in high level competitions, there is often a television match official (TMO; popularly called the \"video referee\"), to assist with certain decisions, linked up to the referee by radio.[82] The referees have a system of hand signals to indicate their decision.[83]  Common offences include tackling above the shoulders, collapsing a scrum, ruck or maul, not releasing the ball when on the ground, or being offside.[84] The non-offending team has a number of options when awarded a penalty: a \"tap\" kick, when the ball is kicked a very short distance from hand, allowing the kicker to regather the ball and run with it; a punt, when the ball is kicked a long distance from hand, for field position; a place-kick, when the kicker will attempt to score a goal; or a scrum.[84] Players may be sent off (signalled by a red card) or temporarily suspended (\"sin-binned\") for ten minutes (yellow card) for foul play or repeated infringements, and may not be replaced.[84]  Occasionally, infringements are not caught by the referee during the match and these may be \"cited\" by the citing commissioner after the match and have punishments (usually suspension for a number of weeks) imposed on the infringing player.[85]  During the match, players may be replaced (for injury) or substituted (for tactical reasons).[48] A player who has been replaced may not rejoin play unless he was temporarily replaced to have bleeding controlled; a player who has been substituted may return temporarily, to replace a player who has a blood injury or has suffered a concussion, or permanently, if he is replacing a front-row forward.[48] In international matches, eight replacements are allowed; in domestic or cross-border tournaments, at the discretion of the responsible national union(s), the number of replacements may be nominated to a maximum of eight, of whom three must be sufficiently trained and experienced to provide cover for the three front row positions.[48][86]  Prior to 2016, all substitutions, no matter the cause, counted against the limit during a match. In 2016, World Rugby changed the law so that substitutions made to replace a player deemed unable to continue due to foul play by the opposition would no longer count against the match limit. This change was introduced in January of that year in the Southern Hemisphere and June in the Northern Hemisphere.[87]  The most basic items of equipment for a game of rugby union are the ball itself, a rugby shirt (also known as a \"jersey\"), rugby shorts, socks, and boots. The rugby ball is oval in shape (technically a prolate spheroid), and is made up of four panels.[88] The ball was historically made of leather, but in the modern era most games use a ball made from a synthetic material. World Rugby lays out specific dimensions for the ball, 280\u2013300\u00a0mm (11\u201312\u00a0in) in length, 740\u2013770\u00a0mm (29\u201330\u00a0in) in circumference of length and 580\u2013620\u00a0mm (23\u201324\u00a0in) in circumference of width.[88] Rugby boots have soles with studs to allow grip on the turf of the pitch. The studs may be either metal or plastic but must not have any sharp edges or ridges.[89]  Protective equipment is optional and strictly regulated. The most common items are mouthguards, which are worn by almost all players, and are compulsory in some rugby-playing nations.[90] Other protective items that are permitted include headgear; thin (not more than 10\u00a0mm thick), non-rigid shoulder pads and shin guards, which are worn underneath socks.[89] Bandages or tape can be worn to support or protect injuries; some players wear tape around the head to protect the ears in scrums and rucks. Female players may also wear chest pads.[89] Although not worn for protection, some types of fingerless mitts are allowed to aid grip.[89]  It is the responsibility of the match officials to check players' clothing and equipment before a game to ensure that it conforms to the laws of the game.[89]  The international governing body of rugby union (and associated games such as sevens) is World Rugby (WR).[91] The WR headquarters are in Dublin, Ireland.[91] WR, founded in 1886, governs the sport worldwide and publishes the game's laws and rankings.[91] As of February 2014, WR (then known as the IRB, for International Rugby Board) recorded 119 unions in its membership, 101 full members and 18 associate member countries.[2] According to WR, rugby union is played by men and women in over 100 countries.[91] WR controls the Rugby World Cup,[91] the Women's Rugby World Cup,[92] Rugby World Cup Sevens,[93] HSBC Sevens Series,[94] HSBC Women's Sevens Series,[95] World Under 20 Championship,[96] World Under 20 Trophy,[97] Nations Cup[98] and the Pacific Nations Cup.[99] WR holds votes to decide where each of these events are to be held, except in the case of the Sevens World Series for men and women, for which WR contracts with several national unions to hold individual events.  Six regional associations, which are members of WR, form the next level of administration; these are:  SANZAAR (South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and Argentina Rugby) is a joint venture of the South African Rugby Union, New Zealand Rugby, Rugby Australia and the Argentine Rugby Union (UAR) that operates Super Rugby and The Rugby Championship (formerly the Tri Nations before the entry of Argentina).[106] Although UAR initially had no representation on the former SANZAR board, it was granted input into the organisation's issues, especially with regard to The Rugby Championship,[107] and became a full SANZAAR member in 2016 (when the country entered Super Rugby).  National unions oversee rugby union within individual countries and are affiliated to WR. Since 2016, the WR Council has 40 seats. A total of 11 unions\u2014the eight foundation unions of England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and France, plus Argentina, Canada and Italy\u2014have two seats each. In addition, the six regional associations have two seats each. Four more unions\u2014Georgia, Japan, Romania and the USA\u2014have one seat each. Finally, the chairman and vice chairman, who usually come from one of the eight foundation unions (although the current vice chairman, Agust\u00edn Pichot, is with the non-foundation Argentine union) have one vote each.[108][91]  The earliest countries to adopt rugby union were England, the country of inception, and the other three Home Nations, Scotland, Ireland and Wales. The spread of rugby union as a global sport has its roots in the exporting of the game by British expatriates, military personnel, and overseas university students. The first rugby club in France was formed by British residents in Le Havre in 1872, while the next year Argentina recorded its first game: 'Banks' v 'City' in Buenos Aires.[109] In turn, French and Argentinian travellers, particularly students, spread the Game beyond the British Empire, forming roots in particular in Italy, Romania, Uruguay and Chile.  Eight countries have adopted rugby union as their de facto national sport; they are Fiji,[110] Georgia, Madagascar,[111][112][113] New Zealand,[114] Samoa,[115] Tonga,[116] Wales and South Africa.[117]  A rugby club was formed in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia in 1864; while the sport was said to have been introduced to New Zealand by Charles Monro in 1870, who played rugby while a student at Christ's College, Finchley.[15]  Several island nations have embraced the sport of rugby. Rugby was first played in Fiji c.\u20091884 by European and Fijian soldiers of the Native Constabulary at Ba on Viti Levu island.[118][119] Fiji then sent their first overseas team to Samoa in 1924, who in turn set up their own union in 1924.[120] Along with Tonga, other countries to have national rugby teams in Oceania include the Cook Islands, Niue, Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands.[121]  In North America a club formed in Montreal in 1868, Canada's first club. The city of Montreal also played its part in the introduction of the sport in the United States, when students of McGill University played against a team from Harvard University in 1874.[15][109] The two variants of gridiron football \u2014 Canadian football and, to a lesser extent, American football \u2014 were once considered forms of rugby football, but the introduction of the legal forward pass severed the conceptual link between the old world rugby codes and new world gridiron codes, and they are seldom now referred to as forms of rugby football. One lasting element of the link, the governing body of Canadian football, Football Canada, was known as the Canadian Rugby Union (CRU) as late as 1967, more than fifty years after the sport parted ways with the established rules of rugby union. The Grey Cup, the trophy awarded to the victorious team playing in the namesake championship of the professional Canadian Football League (CFL), was originally awarded to the champion of the CRU. The two strongest leagues in the CRU, the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union in Eastern Canada and the Western Interprovincial Football Union in Western Canada, evolved into the present day CFL.  Although the exact date of arrival of rugby union in Trinidad and Tobago is unknown, their first club Northern RFC was formed in 1923, a national team was playing by 1927 and due to a cancelled tour to British Guiana in 1933, switched their venue to Barbados; introducing rugby to the island.[122][123] Other Atlantic countries to play rugby union include Jamaica[124] and Bermuda.[125]  Rugby union is the fastest growing college sport and sport in general in the US.[5][6][7]  Major League Rugby is the top professional rugby union competition in the US and Canada. One American professional team, American Raptors, formerly the MLR Glendale and Colorado Raptors, plays in the broadly South American Super Rugby Americas competition.  The growth of rugby union in Europe outside the 6 Nations countries in terms of playing numbers, attendances, and viewership has been sporadic. Historically, British and Irish home teams played the Southern Hemisphere teams of Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, as well as France. The rest of Europe were left to play amongst themselves. During a period when it had been isolated by the British and Irish Unions, France, lacking international competition, became the only European team from the top tier to regularly play the other European countries; mainly Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Romania, Poland, Italy and Czechoslovakia.[103][126] In 1934, instigated by the French Rugby Federation, FIRA (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Rugby Amateur) was formed to organise rugby union outside the authority of the IRFB.[103] The founding members were Italy, Romania, Netherlands, Portugal, Czechoslovakia, and Sweden.  Four European teams have had, at different times, notable success; the most successful, Italy joined the Five Nations Championship as its sixth member, and while it remains the weakest of the Six Nations, Italy has recorded wins over all its 6N rivals with the exception of England, as well as defeating Australia and South Africa. Before Italy's ascension, Romania enjoyed a period of success as their teams, backed by a supportive Communist government, regularly challenged the major European nations. The fall of Communism in Romania led to an era of steep decline from which Romania has yet to fully emerge, but it remains one of the most prominent of the second level European teams. Georgia, in the Caucasus, rose to prominence in the early 21st century; the traditional national game lelo bore strong similarities to rugby union, meaning the country was naturally attracted to the sport upon independence, and the Georgians are now regarded as the top European nation below the traditional Six Nations, and even possibly on a par with Italy. Having qualified for the 2023 Rugby World Cup through the final repechage, Portugal had a startlingly successful tournament, holding Georgia to an 18-18 draw, and performing strongly against Tier One sides Wales and Australia before an historic victory over eventual quarter-finalists Fiji. Portugal demonstrated significant fan support during the tournament.  Other European rugby playing nations of note include Russia, whose first officially recorded match is marked by an encounter between Dynamo Moscow and the Moscow Institute of Physical Education in 1933.[127] Rugby union in Spain, often associated with the Basque and Catalan regions near the French border, is also relatively strong in this context, having twice missed out on World Cup qualification by rule breaches having gained the points required, and hosting several large crowds for European Professional Rugby Cup matches.  In 1999, FIRA agreed to place itself under the auspices of the IRB, transforming itself into a strictly European organising body. Accordingly, it changed its name to FIRA\u2013AER (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Rugby Amateur \u2013 Association Europ\u00e9enne de Rugby). It adopted its current name of Rugby Europe in 2014.  Although Argentina is the best-known rugby playing nation in South America, founding the Argentine Rugby Union in 1899,[128] several other countries on the continent have a long history. Rugby had been played in Brazil since the end of the 19th century, but the game was played regularly only from 1926, when S\u00e3o Paulo beat Santos in an inter-city match.[129] It took Uruguay several aborted attempts to adapt to rugby, led mainly by the efforts of the Montevideo Cricket Club; these efforts succeeded in 1951 with the formation of a national league and four clubs.[130] Other South American countries that formed a rugby union include Chile (1948),[131] and Paraguay (1968).[132]  Super Rugby Americas is the professional Rugby union competition in South America.  Many Asian countries have a tradition of playing rugby dating from the British Empire. India began playing rugby in the early 1870s, the Calcutta Football Club forming in 1873. However, with the departure of a local British army regiment, interest in rugby diminished in the area.[133] In 1878, The Calcutta Football Club was disbanded, and rugby in India faltered.[134] Sri Lanka claims to have founded their union in 1878, and although little official information from the period is available, the team won the All-India cup in Madras in 1920.[135] The first recorded match in Malaysia was in 1892, but the first confirmation of rugby is the existence of the HMS Malaya Cup which was first presented in 1922 and is still awarded to the winners of the Malay sevens.[136]  Rugby union was introduced to Japan in 1899 by two Cambridge students: Ginnosuke Tanaka and Edward Bramwell Clarke.[137][138] The Japan RFU was founded in 1926 and its place in rugby history was cemented when Japan hosted the 2019 World Cup.[139] It was the first country outside the Commonwealth, Ireland and France to host the event, and was viewed by the IRB as an opportunity for rugby union to extend its reach,[139] particularly in Asia. Other Asian playing countries of note include Singapore, South Korea, China and The Philippines, while the former British colony of Hong Kong is notable within rugby for its development of the rugby sevens game, especially the Hong Kong Sevens tournament which was founded in 1976.[140]  Rugby in the Middle East and the Gulf States has its history in the 1950s, with clubs formed by British and French Services stationed in the region after the Second World War.[141] When these servicemen left, the clubs and teams were kept alive by young professionals, mostly Europeans, working in these countries. The official union of Oman was formed in 1971.[142] Bahrain founded its union a year later, while in 1975 the Dubai Sevens, the Gulf's leading rugby tournament, was created. Rugby remains a minority sport in the region with Israel and the United Arab Emirates, as of 2019, being the only member unions from the Middle East to be included in the IRB World Rankings.[143]  In 1875, rugby was introduced to South Africa by British soldiers garrisoned in Cape Town.[109] The game spread quickly across the country, displacing Winchester College football as the sport of choice in South Africa and spreading to nearby Zimbabwe. South African settlers also brought the game with them to Namibia and competed against British administrators in British East Africa. During the late 19th and early 20th century, the sport in Africa was spread by settlers and colonials who often adopted a \"whites-only\" policy to playing the game. This resulted in rugby being viewed as a bourgeois sport by the indigenous people with limited appeal.[144] Despite this, enclaves of black participation developed notably in the Eastern Cape and in Harare. The earliest countries to see the playing of competitive rugby include South Africa, and neighbouring Rhodesia (modern-day Zimbabwe), which formed the Rhodesia Rugby Football Union in 1895 and became a regular stop for touring British and New Zealand sides.[145]  In more recent times the sport has been embraced by several African nations. In the early 21st century Madagascar has experienced crowds of 40,000 at national matches,[146] while Namibia, whose history of rugby can be dated from 1915, have qualified for the final stages of the World Cup seven times since 1999.[147] Other African nations to be represented in the World Rugby Rankings as Member Unions include C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Kenya, Uganda and Zambia.[143] South Africa and Kenya are among the 15 \"core teams\" that participate in every event of the men's World Rugby Sevens Series.[148]  Records of women's rugby football date from the late 19th century, with the first documented source being Emily Valentine's writings, in which she states that she set up a rugby team in Portora Royal School in Enniskillen, Ireland in 1887.[149] Although there are reports of early women's matches in New Zealand and France, one of the first notable games to prove primary evidence was the 1917 war-time encounter between Cardiff Ladies and Newport Ladies; a photo of which shows the Cardiff team before the match at the Cardiff Arms Park.[150] Since the 1980s, the game has grown in popularity among female athletes, and by 2010, according to World Rugby, women's rugby was being played in over 100 countries.[151]  The English-based Women's Rugby Football Union (WRFU), responsible for women's rugby in England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, was founded in 1983, and is the oldest formally organised national governing body for women's rugby. This was replaced in 1994 by the Rugby Football Union for Women (RFUW) in England with each of the other Home Nations governing their own countries.[152]  The premier international competition in rugby union for women is the Women's Rugby World Cup, first held in 1991; from 1994 through 2014, it was held every four years.[152] After the 2014 event, the tournament was brought forward a year to 2017 to avoid clashing with other sporting cycles, in particular the Rugby World Cup Sevens competition.[153] The Women's Rugby World Cup returned to a four-year cycle after 2017, with future competitions to be held in the middle year of the men's World Cup cycle.  The most important competition in rugby union is the Rugby World Cup, a men's tournament that has taken place every four years since the inaugural event in 1987. South Africa are the reigning champions, having defeated New Zealand 11-12 in the final of the 2023 Rugby World Cup in an enthalling match at the Stade de France. [154] South Africa has the highest number of World Cup wins: 4 (1995, 2007, 2019 and 2023). New Zealand won the title three times (1987, 2011 and 2015), Australia have won twice (1991 and 1999), and England once (2003). England is the only team from the Northern Hemisphere to have won the Rugby World Cup.[155]  The Rugby World Cup has continued to grow since its inception in 1987. The first tournament, in which 16 teams competed for the title, was broadcast to 17 countries with an accumulated total of 230\u00a0million television viewers. Ticket sales during the pool stages and finals of the same tournament was less than a million. The 2007 World Cup was contested by 94 countries with ticket sales of 3,850,000 over the pool and final stage. The accumulated television audience for the event, then broadcast to 200 countries, was a claimed 4.2\u00a0billion.[156]  The 2019 Rugby World Cup took place in Japan between 20 September and 2 November. It was the ninth edition and the first time the tournament has been held in Asia.[157]  Major international competitions are the Six Nations Championship and The Rugby Championship, held in Europe and the Southern Hemisphere respectively.[158]  The Six Nations is an annual competition involving the European teams England, France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales.[159] Each country plays the other five once. Following the first internationals between England and Scotland, Ireland and Wales began competing in the 1880s, forming the Home International Championships.[159] France joined the tournament in the 1900s and in 1910 the term Five Nations first appeared.[159] However, the Home Nations (England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales) excluded France in 1931 amid a run of poor results, allegations of professionalism and concerns over on-field violence.[160] France then rejoined in 1939\u20131940, though World War II halted proceedings for a further eight years.[159] France has played in all the tournaments since WWII, the first of which was played in 1947.[159] In 2000, Italy became the sixth nation in the contest and Rome's Stadio Olimpico has replaced Stadio Flaminio as the venue for their home games since 2013.[161]  The Rugby Championship is the Southern Hemisphere's annual international series for that region's top national teams. From its inception in 1996 through 2011, it was known as the Tri Nations, as it featured the hemisphere's traditional powers of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.[162] These teams have dominated world rankings in recent years, and many considered the Tri Nations to be the toughest competition in international rugby.[163][164] The Tri Nations was initially played on a home and away basis with the three nations playing each other twice.[165]  In 2006 a new system was introduced where each nation plays the others three times, though in 2007 and 2011 the teams played each other only twice, as both were World Cup years.[162] Since Argentina's strong performances in the 2007 World Cup,[166] after the 2009 Tri Nations tournament, SANZAR (South Africa, New Zealand and Australian Rugby) invited the Argentine Rugby Union (UAR) to join an expanded Four Nations tournament in 2012.[167] The competition has been officially rechristened as The Rugby Championship beginning with the 2012 edition. The competition reverted to the Tri Nations' original home-and-away format, but now involving four teams. In World Cup years, an abbreviated tournament is held in which each team plays the others only once. In 2020, the \"Tri Nations\" format was temporarily revived due to the withdrawal of South Africa owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.[168]  Rugby union was played at the Olympic Games in 1900, 1908, 1920 and 1924.[169] As per Olympic rules, the nations of Scotland, Wales and England were not allowed to play separately as they are not sovereign states. In 1900, France won the gold, beating Great Britain 27 points to 8 and defeating Germany 27 points to 17.[169] In 1908, Australia defeated Great Britain, claiming the gold medal, the score being 32 points to three.[169] In 1920, the United States, fielding a team with many players new to the sport of rugby, upset France in a shock win, eight points to zero. In 1924, the United States again defeated France 17 to 3, becoming the only team to win gold twice in the sport.[169]  In 2009 the International Olympic Committee voted with a majority of 81 to 8 that rugby union be reinstated as an Olympic sport in at least the 2016 and 2020 games, but in the sevens, 4-day tournament format.[38][170] This is something the rugby world has aspired to for a long time and Bernard Lapasset, president of the International Rugby Board, said the Olympic gold medal would be considered to be \"the pinnacle of our sport\" (Rugby Sevens).[171]  Rugby sevens has been played at the Commonwealth Games since the 1998 Games in Kuala Lumpur.[172] The most gold medal holders are New Zealand who have won the competition on four successive occasions until South Africa beat them in 2014.[173] Rugby union has also been an Asian Games event since the 1998 games in Bangkok, Thailand. In the 1998 and 2002 editions of the games, both the usual fifteen-a-side variety and rugby sevens were played, but from 2006 onwards, only rugby sevens was retained. In 2010, the women's rugby sevens event was introduced. The event is likely to remain a permanent fixture of the Asian Games due to elevation of rugby sevens as an Olympic sport from the 2016 Olympics onwards. The present gold medal holders in the sevens tournament, held in 2014, are Japan in the men's event and China in the women's.[citation needed]  Women's international rugby union began in 1982, with a match between France and the Netherlands played in Utrecht.[174] As of 2009 over six hundred women's internationals have been played by over forty different nations.[175]  The first Women's Rugby World Cup was held in Wales in 1991 and was won by the United States.[152] The second tournament took place in 1994, and from that time through 2014 was held every four years. The New Zealand Women's team then won four straight World Cups (1998, 2002, 2006, 2010)[176] before England won in 2014. Following the 2014 event, World Rugby moved the next edition of the event to 2017, with a new four-year cycle from that point forward.[177] New Zealand are the current World Cup holders.  As well as the Women's Rugby World Cup there are also other regular tournaments, including a Six Nations, run in parallel to the men's competition. The Women's Six Nations, first played in 1996 has been dominated by England, who have won the tournament on 14 occasions, including a run of seven consecutive wins from 2006 to 2012. However, since then, England have won only in 2017; reigning champion France have won in each even-numbered year (2014, 2016, 2018) whilst Ireland won in 2013 and 2015.  Rugby union has been professionalised since 1995. Professionalism has brought mixed results, with grassroots participation falling and financial struggles in the professional arena.[178] The following table shows professional and semi-professional rugby union competitions.  Rugby union has spawned several variants of the full-contact, 15-a-side game. The two most common differences in adapted versions are fewer players and reduced player contact.  The oldest variant is rugby sevens (sometimes 7s or VIIs), a fast-paced game which originated in Melrose, Scotland in 1883. In rugby sevens, there are only seven players per side, and each half is normally seven minutes. Major tournaments include the Hong Kong Sevens and Dubai Sevens, both held in areas not normally associated with the highest levels of the 15-a-side game.  A more recent variant of the sport is rugby tens (10s or Xs), a Malaysian invention with ten players per side.[183]  Touch rugby, in which \"tackles\" are made by simply touching the ball carrier with two hands, is popular both as a training game and more formally as a mixed sex version of the sport played by both children and adults.[184][185]  Several variants have been created to introduce the sport to children with a less physical contact.[186] Mini rugby is a version aimed at fostering the sport in children.[187][188] It is played with only eight players and on a smaller pitch.[187]  Tag Rugby is a version in which the players wear a belt with two tags attached by velcro, the removal of either counting as a 'tackle'. Tag Rugby also varies in that kicking the ball is not allowed.[189] Similar to Tag Rugby, American Flag Rugby, (AFR), is a mixed gender, non-contact imitation of rugby union designed for American children entering grades K-9.[190] Both American Flag Rugby and Mini Rugby differ from Tag Rugby in that they introduce more advanced elements of rugby union as the participants age.[187]  Ten man rugby is an extreme style of play in rugby union in which the team uses the power of its forwards to dominate possession, scrums and line-outs, and the kicking ability of its fly-half to attain position. The four three-quarter backs and the full back are not usually used in attack; if they are, this is usually restricted to the inside centre on the crash ball, and chasing kicks, especially garryowens. Ten man rugby is a very conservative style of play, and not particularly entertaining for the spectator, but can be effective if a team has a strong pack and a good 10, and perhaps less effective backs. The term \"ten man rugby\" is somewhat derogatory, though most teams will employ these tactics to a degree, especially in foul weather, but usually not exclusively.[191][192][193][194]  Other less formal variants include beach rugby and snow rugby.[186][195]  Rugby league was formed after the Northern Union broke from the Rugby Football Union in a disagreement over payment to players. It went on to change its laws and became a football code in its own right. The two sports continue to influence each other to this day.  American football[196][197] and Canadian football[198] are derived from early forms of rugby football.[198]  Australian rules football was influenced by rugby football and other games originating in English public schools.[199][200][201]  James Naismith took aspects of many sports including rugby to invent basketball.[202] The most obvious contribution is the jump ball's similarity to the line-out as well as the underhand shooting style that dominated the early years of the sport. Naismith played rugby at McGill University.[203]  Swedish football was a code whose rules were a mix of Association and Rugby football rules.[204][205]  Rugby lends its name to wheelchair rugby, a full-contact sport which contains elements of rugby such as crossing a try line with the ball to score.[206]  According to a 2023 report by the Centre for the International Business of Sport, over ten million people play rugby union or one of its variants organised by the IRB.[207] This is a significant increase since the previous report in 2011.[208] The report also claimed that since 2011 participation has grown by 33 per cent in Africa, 28 per cent in South America and 18 per cent in Asia and North America.[208] In 2023 the IRB published a breakdown of the total number of players worldwide by national unions. It recorded a total of 10.9\u00a0million players globally, of those, 8.4\u00a0million were registered members playing for a club affiliated to their country's union.[2] The 2016 World Rugby Year in Review reported 8.5\u00a0million players, of which 3.2\u00a0million were registered union players and 1.9\u00a0million were registered club players; 22% of all players were female.[209]  The most capped international player from the tier 1 nations is Welsh captain Alun Wyn Jones who has played over 150 internationals. While the top scoring tier 1 international player is New Zealand's Dan Carter, who has amassed 1442 points during his career.[210] In April 2010 Lithuania which is a second tier rugby nation, broke the record of consecutive international wins for second tier rugby nations. In 2016, the All Blacks of New Zealand set the new record 18 consecutive test wins among tier 1 rugby nations, bettering their previous consecutive run of 17.[211] This record was equalled by England on 11 March 2017 with a win over Scotland at Twickenham.[212] The highest scoring international match between two recognised unions was Hong Kong's 164\u201313 victory over Singapore on 27 October 1994.[213] While the largest winning margin of 152 points is held by two countries, Japan (a 155\u20133 win over Chinese Taipei) and Argentina (152\u20130 over Paraguay) both in 2002.[213]  The record attendance for a rugby union game was set on 15 July 2000 in which New Zealand defeated Australia 39\u201335 in a Bledisloe Cup game at Stadium Australia in Sydney before 109,874 fans.[214] The record attendance for a match in Europe of 104,000 (at the time a world record) was set on 1 March 1975 when Scotland defeated Wales 12\u201310 at Murrayfield in Edinburgh during the 1975 Five Nations Championship.[214] This crowd however is an estimate and contemporaneous newspaper accounts list a crowd of 80,000 only. The record attendance for a domestic club match is 99,124, set when Racing 92 defeated Toulon in the 2016 Top 14 final on 24 June at Camp Nou in Barcelona. The match had been moved from its normal site of Stade de France near Paris due to scheduling conflicts with France's hosting of UEFA Euro 2016.[215]  Thomas Hughes's 1857 novel Tom Brown's Schooldays, set at Rugby School, includes a rugby football match, also portrayed in the 1940s film of the same name. James Joyce mentions Irish team Bective Rangers in several of his works, including Ulysses (1922) and Finnegans Wake (1939), while his 1916 semi-autobiographical work A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man has an account of Ireland international James Magee.[216] Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, in his 1924 Sherlock Holmes tale The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire, mentions that Dr Watson played rugby for Blackheath.[217]  Henri Rousseau's 1908 work Joueurs de football shows two pairs of rugby players competing.[218] Other French artists to have represented the sport in their works include Albert Gleizes' Les Joueurs de football (1912), Robert Delaunay's Football. L'\u00c9quipe de Cardiff (1916) and Andr\u00e9 Lhote's Partie de Rugby (1917).[219] The 1928 Gold Medal for Art at the Amsterdam Olympics was won by Luxembourg's Jean Jacoby for his work Rugby.[220]  In film, Ealing Studios' 1949 comedy A Run for Your Money and the 1979 BBC Wales television film Grand Slam both centre on fans attending a match.[221] Films that explore the sport in more detail include independent production Old Scores (1991) and Forever Strong (2008). Invictus (2009), based on John Carlin's book Playing the Enemy, explores the events of the 1995 Rugby World Cup and Nelson Mandela's attempt to use the sport to connect South Africa's people post-apartheid.[222][223]  In public art and sculpture there are many works dedicated to the sport. There is a 27 feet (8.2\u00a0m) bronze statue of a rugby line-out by pop artist Gerald Laing at Twickenham[224] and one of rugby administrator Sir Tasker Watkins at the Millennium Stadium.[225] Rugby players to have been honoured with statues include Gareth Edwards in Cardiff and Danie Craven in Stellenbosch.[226]  Printed sources  Electronic sources "},{"title":"England","content":"  \u2013\u00a0in Europe\u00a0(green &\u00a0dark grey)\u2013\u00a0in the United Kingdom\u00a0(green) England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom.[6] The country is located on the island of Great Britain, of which it covers roughly 62%, and over 100 smaller adjacent islands. It has land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west, and is otherwise surrounded by the North Sea to the east, the English Channel to the south, the Celtic Sea to the south-west, and the Irish sea to the west. Continental Europe lies to the south-east, and Ireland to the west. The population was 56,490,048 at the 2021 census. London is both the largest city and the capital.  The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Paleolithic, but takes its name from the Angles, a Germanic tribe who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries. England became a unified state in the 10th century and has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world since the Age of Discovery, which began during the 15th century.[7] The Kingdom of England, which included Wales after 1535, ceased being a separate sovereign state on 1 May 1707 when the Acts of Union put the terms agreed in the Treaty of Union the previous year into effect; this resulted in a political union with the Kingdom of Scotland that created the Kingdom of Great Britain.[8]  England is the origin of many well-known worldwide exports, including the English language, the English legal system (which served as the basis for the common law systems of many other countries), association football, and the Church of England; its parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations.[9] The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England, transforming its society into the world's first industrialised nation.[10] England is home to the two oldest universities in the English-speaking world: the University of Oxford, founded in 1096, and the University of Cambridge, founded in 1209. Both universities are ranked among the most prestigious in the world.[11][12]  England's terrain chiefly consists of low hills and plains, especially in the centre and south. Upland and mountainous terrain is mostly found in the north and west, including Dartmoor, the Lake District, the Pennines, and the Shropshire Hills. The country's capital is London, the greater metropolitan of which has a population of 14.2\u00a0million as of 2021, representing the United Kingdom's largest metropolitan area. England's population of 56.3\u00a0million comprises 84% of the population of the United Kingdom,[13] largely concentrated around London, the South East, and conurbations in the Midlands, the North West, the North East, and Yorkshire, which each developed as major industrial regions during the 19th century.[14]  The name \"England\" is derived from the Old English name Englaland, which means \"land of the Angles\".[15] The Angles were one of the Germanic tribes that settled in Great Britain during the Early Middle Ages. The Angles came from the Anglia peninsula in the Bay of Kiel area (present-day German state of Schleswig-Holstein) of the Baltic Sea.[16] The earliest recorded use of the term, as \"Engla londe\", is in the late-ninth-century translation into Old English of Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People. The term was then used to mean \"the land inhabited by the English\", and it included English people in what is now south-east Scotland but was then part of the English kingdom of Northumbria. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle recorded that the Domesday Book of 1086 covered the whole of England, meaning the English kingdom, but a few years later the Chronicle stated that King Malcolm III went \"out of Scotlande into Lothian in Englaland\", thus using it in the more ancient sense.[17]  The earliest attested reference to the Angles occurs in the 1st-century work by Tacitus, Germania, in which the Latin word Anglii is used.[18] The etymology of the tribal name itself is disputed by scholars; it has been suggested that it derives from the shape of the Angeln peninsula, an angular shape.[19] How and why a term derived from the name of a tribe that was less significant than others, such as the Saxons, came to be used for the entire country is not known, but it seems this is related to the custom of calling the Germanic people in Britain Angli Saxones or English Saxons to distinguish them from continental Saxons (Eald-Seaxe) of Old Saxony in Germany.[20] In Scottish Gaelic, the Saxon tribe gave their name to the word for England (Sasunn);[21] similarly, the Welsh name for the English language is \"Saesneg\". A romantic name for England is Loegria, related to the Welsh word for England, Lloegr, and made popular by its use in Arthurian legend. Albion is also applied to England in a more poetic capacity,[22] though its original meaning is the island of Britain as a whole.  The earliest known evidence of human presence in the area now known as England was that of Homo antecessor, dating to approximately 780,000 years ago. The oldest proto-human bones discovered in England date from 500,000\u00a0years ago.[23] Modern humans are known to have inhabited the area during the Upper Paleolithic period, though permanent settlements were only established within the last 6,000 years.[24] After the last ice age only large mammals such as mammoths, bison and woolly rhinoceros remained. Roughly 11,000\u00a0years ago, when the ice sheets began to recede, humans repopulated the area; genetic research suggests they came from the northern part of the Iberian Peninsula.[25] The sea level was lower than the present day and Britain was connected by land bridge to Ireland and Eurasia.[26] As the seas rose, it was separated from Ireland 10,000\u00a0years ago and from Eurasia two millennia later.  The Beaker culture arrived around 2,500\u00a0BC, introducing drinking and food vessels constructed from clay, as well as vessels used as reduction pots to smelt copper ores.[27] It was during this time that major Neolithic monuments such as Stonehenge (phase III) and Avebury were constructed. By heating together tin and copper, which were in abundance in the area, the Beaker culture people made bronze, and later iron from iron ores. The development of iron smelting allowed the construction of better ploughs, advancing agriculture (for instance, with Celtic fields), as well as the production of more effective weapons.[28]  During the Iron Age, Celtic culture, deriving from the Hallstatt and La T\u00e8ne cultures, arrived from Central Europe. Brythonic was the spoken language during this time. Society was tribal; according to Ptolemy's Geographia there were around 20 tribes in the area. Like other regions on the edge of the Empire, Britain had long enjoyed trading links with the Romans. Julius Caesar of the Roman Republic attempted to invade twice in 55\u00a0BC; although largely unsuccessful, he managed to set up a client king from the Trinovantes.  The Romans invaded Britain in 43 AD during the reign of Emperor Claudius, subsequently conquering much of Britain, and the area was incorporated into the Roman Empire as Britannia province.[29] The best-known of the native tribes who attempted to resist were the Catuvellauni led by Caratacus. Later, an uprising led by Boudica, Queen of the Iceni, ended with Boudica's suicide following her defeat at the Battle of Watling Street.[30] The author of one study of Roman Britain suggested that from 43 AD to 84 AD, the Roman invaders killed somewhere between 100,000 and 250,000 people from a population of perhaps 2,000,000.[31] This era saw a Greco-Roman culture prevail with the introduction of Roman law, Roman architecture, aqueducts, sewers, many agricultural items and silk.[32] In the 3rd century, Emperor Septimius Severus died at Eboracum (now York), where Constantine was subsequently proclaimed emperor a century later.[33]  There is debate about when Christianity was first introduced; it was no later than the 4th century, probably much earlier. According to Bede, missionaries were sent from Rome by Eleutherius at the request of the chieftain Lucius of Britain in 180 AD, to settle differences as to Eastern and Western ceremonials, which were disturbing the church. There are traditions linked to Glastonbury claiming an introduction through Joseph of Arimathea, while others claim through Lucius of Britain.[34] By 410, during the decline of the Roman Empire, Britain was left exposed by the end of Roman rule in Britain and the withdrawal of Roman army units, to defend the frontiers in continental Europe and partake in civil wars.[35] Celtic Christian monastic and missionary movements flourished. This period of Christianity was influenced by ancient Celtic culture in its sensibilities, polity, practices and theology. Local \"congregations\" were centred in the monastic community and monastic leaders were more like chieftains, as peers, rather than in the more hierarchical system of the Roman-dominated church.[36]  Roman military withdrawals left Britain open to invasion by pagan, seafaring warriors from north-western continental Europe, chiefly the Saxons, Angles, Jutes and Frisians who had long raided the coasts of the Roman province. These groups then began to settle in increasing numbers over the course of the fifth and sixth centuries, initially in the eastern part of the country.[35] Their advance was contained for some decades after the Britons' victory at the Battle of Mount Badon, but subsequently resumed, overrunning the fertile lowlands of Britain and reducing the area under Brittonic control to a series of separate enclaves in the more rugged country to the west by the end of the 6th century. Contemporary texts describing this period are extremely scarce, giving rise to its description as a Dark Age. Details of the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain are consequently subject to considerable disagreement; the emerging consensus is that it occurred on a large scale in the south and east but was less substantial to the north and west, where Celtic languages continued to be spoken even in areas under Anglo-Saxon control.[37][38] Roman-dominated Christianity had, in general, been replaced in the conquered territories by Anglo-Saxon paganism, but was reintroduced by missionaries from Rome led by Augustine from 597.[39] Disputes between the Roman- and Celtic-dominated forms of Christianity ended in victory for the Roman tradition at the Council of Whitby (664), which was ostensibly about tonsures (clerical haircuts) and the date of Easter, but more significantly, about the differences in Roman and Celtic forms of authority, theology, and practice.[36]  During the settlement period the lands ruled by the incomers seem to have been fragmented into numerous tribal territories, but by the 7th century, when substantial evidence of the situation again becomes available, these had coalesced into roughly a dozen kingdoms including Northumbria, Mercia, Wessex, East Anglia, Essex, Kent and Sussex. Over the following centuries, this process of political consolidation continued.[40] The 7th century saw a struggle for hegemony between Northumbria and Mercia, which in the 8th century gave way to Mercian preeminence.[41] In the early 9th century Mercia was displaced as the foremost kingdom by Wessex. Later in that century escalating attacks by the Danes culminated in the conquest of the north and east of England, overthrowing the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and East Anglia. Wessex under Alfred the Great was left as the only surviving English kingdom, and under his successors, it steadily expanded at the expense of the kingdoms of the Danelaw. This brought about the political unification of England, first accomplished under \u00c6thelstan in 927 and definitively established after further conflicts by Eadred in 953. A fresh wave of Scandinavian attacks from the late 10th century ended with the conquest of this united kingdom by Sweyn Forkbeard in 1013 and again by his son Cnut in 1016, turning it into the centre of a short-lived North Sea Empire that also included Denmark and Norway. However, the native royal dynasty was restored with the accession of Edward the Confessor in 1042.  A dispute over the succession to Edward led to an unsuccessful Norwegian Invasion in September 1066 close to York in the North, and the successful Norman Conquest in October 1066, accomplished by an army led by Duke William of Normandy invading at Hastings late September 1066.[42] The Normans themselves originated from Scandinavia and had settled in Normandy in the late 9th and early 10th centuries.[43] This conquest led to the almost total dispossession of the English elite and its replacement by a new French-speaking aristocracy, whose speech had a profound and permanent effect on the English language.[44]  Subsequently, the House of Plantagenet from Anjou inherited the English throne under Henry II, adding England to the budding Angevin Empire of fiefs the family had inherited in France including Aquitaine.[45] They reigned for three centuries, some noted monarchs being Richard I, Edward I, Edward III and Henry V.[45] The period saw changes in trade and legislation, including the signing of Magna Carta, an English legal charter used to limit the sovereign's powers by law and protect the privileges of freemen. Catholic monasticism flourished, providing philosophers, and the universities of Oxford and Cambridge were founded with royal patronage. The Principality of Wales became a Plantagenet fief during the 13th century[46] and the Lordship of Ireland was given to the English monarchy by the Pope. During the 14th century, the Plantagenets and the House of Valois claimed to be legitimate claimants to the House of Capet and of France; the two powers clashed in the Hundred Years' War.[47] The Black Death epidemic hit England; starting in 1348, it eventually killed up to half of England's inhabitants.[48]  Between 1453 and 1487, a civil war known as the War of the Roses waged between the two branches of the royal family, the Yorkists and Lancastrians.[49] Eventually it led to the Yorkists losing the throne entirely to a Welsh noble family the Tudors, a branch of the Lancastrians headed by Henry Tudor who invaded with Welsh and Breton mercenaries, gaining victory at the Battle of Bosworth Field where the Yorkist king Richard III was killed.[50]  During the Tudor period, England began to develop naval skills, and exploration intensified in the Age of Discovery.[51] Henry VIII broke from communion with the Catholic Church, over issues relating to his divorce, under the Acts of Supremacy in 1534 which proclaimed the monarch head of the Church of England. In contrast with much of European Protestantism, the roots of the split were more political than theological.[c] He also legally incorporated his ancestral land Wales into the Kingdom of England with the 1535\u20131542 acts. There were internal religious conflicts during the reigns of Henry's daughters, Mary I and Elizabeth I. The former took the country back to Catholicism while the latter broke from it again, forcefully asserting the supremacy of Anglicanism. The Elizabethan era is the epoch in the Tudor age of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I (\"the Virgin Queen\"). Historians often depict it as the golden age in English history that represented the apogee of the English Renaissance and saw the flowering of great art, drama, poetry, music and literature.[53] England during this period had a centralised, well-organised, and effective government.[54]  Competing with Spain, the first English colony in the Americas was founded in 1585 by explorer Walter Raleigh in Virginia and named Roanoke. The Roanoke colony failed and is known as the lost colony after it was found abandoned on the return of the late-arriving supply ship.[55] With the East India Company, England also competed with the Dutch and French in the East. During the Elizabethan period, England was at war with Spain. An armada sailed from Spain in 1588 as part of a wider plan to invade England and re-establish a Catholic monarchy. The plan was thwarted by bad coordination, stormy weather and successful harrying attacks by an English fleet under Lord Howard of Effingham. This failure did not end the threat: Spain launched two further armadas, in 1596 and 1597, but both were driven back by storms.  The political structure of the island changed in 1603, when the King of Scots, James VI, a kingdom which had been a long-time rival to English interests, inherited the throne of England as James I, thereby creating a personal union.[56] He styled himself King of Great Britain, although this had no basis in English law.[57] Under the auspices of James VI and I the Authorised King James Version of the Holy Bible was published in 1611. It was the standard version of the Bible read by most Protestant Christians for four hundred years until modern revisions were produced in the 20th century.  Based on conflicting political, religious and social positions, the English Civil War was fought between the supporters of Parliament and those of King Charles I, known colloquially as Roundheads and Cavaliers respectively. This was an interwoven part of the wider multifaceted Wars of the Three Kingdoms, involving Scotland and Ireland. The Parliamentarians were victorious, Charles I was executed and the kingdom replaced by the Commonwealth. Leader of the Parliament forces, Oliver Cromwell declared himself Lord Protector in 1653; a period of personal rule followed.[58] After Cromwell's death and the resignation of his son Richard as Lord Protector, Charles II was invited to return as monarch in 1660, in a move called the Restoration. With the reopening of theatres, fine arts, literature and performing arts flourished throughout the Restoration of the \"Merry Monarch\" Charles II.[59] After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, it was constitutionally established that King and Parliament should rule together, though Parliament would have the real power. This was established with the Bill of Rights in 1689. Among the statutes set down were that the law could only be made by Parliament and could not be suspended by the King, also that the King could not impose taxes or raise an army without the prior approval of Parliament.[60] Also since that time, no British monarch has entered the House of Commons when it is sitting, which is annually commemorated at the State Opening of Parliament by the British monarch when the doors of the House of Commons are slammed in the face of the monarch's messenger, symbolising the rights of Parliament and its independence from the monarch.[61] With the founding of the Royal Society in 1660, science was greatly encouraged.  In 1666 the Great Fire of London gutted the city of London, but it was rebuilt shortly afterward with many significant buildings designed by Sir Christopher Wren.[62] By the mid-to-late 17th century, two political factions had emerged \u2013 the Tories and Whigs. Though the Tories initially supported Catholic king James II, some of them, along with the Whigs, during the Revolution of 1688 invited the Dutch Prince William of Orange to defeat James and become the king. Some English people, especially in the north, were Jacobites and continued to support James and his sons. Under the Stuart dynasty England expanded in trade, finance and prosperity. The Royal Navy developed Europe's largest merchant fleet.[63] After the parliaments of England and Scotland agreed,[64] the two countries joined in political union, to create the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707.[56] To accommodate the union, institutions such as the law and national churches of each remained separate.[65]  Under the newly formed Kingdom of Great Britain, output from the Royal Society and other English initiatives combined with the Scottish Enlightenment to create innovations in science and engineering, while the enormous growth in British overseas trade protected by the Royal Navy paved the way for the establishment of the British Empire. Domestically it drove the Industrial Revolution, a period of profound change in the socioeconomic and cultural conditions of England, resulting in industrialised agriculture, manufacture, engineering and mining, as well as new and pioneering road, rail and water networks to facilitate their expansion and development.[66] The opening of Northwest England's Bridgewater Canal in 1761 ushered in the canal age in Britain.[67] In 1825 the world's first permanent steam locomotive-hauled passenger railway \u2013 the Stockton and Darlington Railway \u2013 opened to the public.[67]  During the Industrial Revolution, many workers moved from England's countryside to new and expanding urban industrial areas to work in factories, for instance at Birmingham and Manchester,[69] with the latter the world's first industrial city.[70] England maintained relative stability throughout the French Revolution, under George III and William Pitt the Younger. The regency of George IV is noted for its elegance and achievements in the fine arts and architecture.[71] During the Napoleonic Wars, Napoleon planned to invade from the south-east; however, this failed to manifest and the Napoleonic forces were defeated by the British: at sea by Horatio Nelson, and on land by Arthur Wellesley. The major victory at the Battle of Trafalgar confirmed the naval supremacy Britain had established during the course of the eighteenth century.[72] The Napoleonic Wars fostered a concept of Britishness and a united national British people, shared with the English, Scots and Welsh.[73]  London became the largest and most populous metropolitan area in the world during the Victorian era, and trade within the British Empire \u2013 as well as the standing of the British military and navy \u2013 was prestigious.[74] Technologically, this era saw many innovations that proved key to the United Kingdom's power and prosperity.[75] Political agitation at home from radicals such as the Chartists and the suffragettes enabled legislative reform and universal suffrage.[76]  Power shifts in east-central Europe led to World War I; hundreds of thousands of English soldiers died fighting for the United Kingdom as part of the Allies.[d] Two decades later, in World War II, the United Kingdom was again one of the Allies. Developments in warfare technology saw many cities damaged by air-raids during the Blitz. Following the war, the British Empire experienced rapid decolonisation, and there was a speeding-up of technological innovations; automobiles became the primary means of transport and Frank Whittle's development of the jet engine led to wider air travel.[78] Residential patterns were altered in England by private motoring, and by the creation of the National Health Service in 1948, providing publicly funded health care to all permanent residents free at the point of need. Combined, these prompted the reform of local government in England in the mid-20th century.[79]  Since the 20th century, there has been significant population movement to England, mostly from other parts of the British Isles, but also from the Commonwealth, particularly the Indian subcontinent.[80] Since the 1970s there has been a large move away from manufacturing and an increasing emphasis on the service industry.[81] As part of the United Kingdom, the area joined a common market initiative called the European Economic Community which became the European Union. Since the late 20th century the administration of the United Kingdom has moved towards devolved governance in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.[82] England and Wales continues to exist as a jurisdiction within the United Kingdom.[83] Devolution has stimulated a greater emphasis on a more English-specific identity and patriotism.[84] There is no devolved English government, but an attempt to create a similar system on a sub-regional basis was rejected by referendum.[85]  England is part of the United Kingdom, a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system.[86] There has not been a government of England since 1707, when the Acts of Union 1707,[87] putting into effect the terms of the Treaty of Union, joined England and Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain.[64] Before the union England was ruled by its monarch and the Parliament of England. Today England is governed directly by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, although other countries of the United Kingdom have devolved governments.[88]  In the House of Commons which is the lower house of the British Parliament based at the Palace of Westminster, there are 532 members of parliament (MPs) for constituencies in England, out of the 650 total.[89] England is represented by 345 MPs from the Conservative Party, 179 from the Labour Party, seven from the Liberal Democrats, one from the Green Party, and the Speaker of the House.  Since devolution, in which other countries of the United Kingdom \u2013 Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland \u2013 each have their own devolved parliament or assemblies for local issues, there has been debate about how to counterbalance this in England. Originally it was planned that various regions of England would be devolved, but following the proposal's rejection by the North East in a 2004 referendum, this has not been carried out.[85]  The English law legal system, developed over the centuries, is the basis of common law[90] legal systems used in most Commonwealth countries[91] and the United States (except Louisiana). Despite now being part of the United Kingdom, the legal system of the Courts of England and Wales continued, under the Treaty of Union, as a separate legal system from the one used in Scotland. The general essence of English law is that it is made by judges sitting in courts, applying their common sense and knowledge of legal precedent \u2013 stare decisis \u2013 to the facts before them.[92]  The court system is headed by the Senior Courts of England and Wales, consisting of the Court of Appeal, the High Court of Justice for civil cases, and the Crown Court for criminal cases.[93] The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom is the highest court for criminal and civil cases in England and Wales. It was created in 2009 after constitutional changes, taking over the judicial functions of the House of Lords.[94] A decision of the Supreme Court is binding on every other court in the hierarchy, which must follow its directions.[95]  The Secretary of State for Justice is the minister responsible to Parliament for the judiciary, the court system and prisons and probation in England.[96] Crime increased between 1981 and 1995 but fell by 42% in the period 1995\u20132006.[97] The prison population doubled over the same period, giving it one of the highest incarceration rates in Western Europe at 147 per 100,000.[98] His Majesty's Prison Service, reporting to the Ministry of Justice, manages most prisons, housing 81,309 prisoners in England and Wales as of September\u00a02022[update].[99]  The subdivisions of England consist of up to four levels of subnational division, controlled through a variety of types of administrative entities created for the purposes of local government.  Outside the London region, England's highest tier is the 48 ceremonial counties.[100] These are used primarily as a geographical frame of reference. Of these, 38 developed gradually since the Middle Ages; these were reformed to 51 in 1974 and to their current number in 1996.[101] Each has a Lord Lieutenant and High Sheriff; these posts are used to represent the British monarch locally.[100] Some counties, such as Herefordshire, are only divided further into civil parishes. The royal county of Berkshire and the metropolitan counties have different types of status to other ceremonial counties.[102]  The second tier is made up of combined authorities and the 27 county-tier shire counties. In 1974, all ceremonial counties were two-tier; and with the metropolitan county tier phased out, the 1996 reform separated the ceremonial county and the administrative county tier.  England is also divided into local government districts.[103] The district can align to a ceremonial county, or be a district tier within a shire county, be a royal or metropolitan borough, have borough or city status, or be a unitary authority.  At the community level, much of England is divided into civil parishes with their own councils; in Greater London only one such parish, Queen's Park, exists as of 2014[update] after they were abolished in 1965 until legislation allowed their recreation in 2007.  From 1994 until the early 2010s England was divided for a few purposes into regions; a 1998 referendum for the London Region created the London Assembly two years later.[104] A failed 2004 North East England devolution referendum cancelled further regional assembly devolution[85] with the regional structure outside London abolished.  Ceremonially and administratively, the region is divided between the City of London and Greater London; these are further divided into the 32 London Boroughs and the 25 Wards of the City of London.[105]  Geographically, England includes the central and southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain, plus such offshore islands as the Isle of Wight and the Isles of Scilly. It is bordered by two other countries of the United Kingdom: to the north by Scotland and to the west by Wales.  England is closer than any other part of mainland Britain to the European continent. It is separated from France (Hauts-de-France) by a 21-mile (34\u00a0km)[106] sea gap, though the two countries are connected by the Channel Tunnel near Folkestone.[107] England also has shores on the Irish Sea, North Sea and Atlantic Ocean.  The ports of London, Liverpool, and Newcastle lie on the tidal rivers Thames, Mersey and Tyne respectively. At 220 miles (350\u00a0km), the Severn is the longest river flowing through England.[108] It empties into the Bristol Channel and is notable for its Severn Bore (a tidal bore), which can reach 2 metres (6.6\u00a0ft) in height.[109] However, the longest river entirely in England is the Thames, which is 215 miles (346\u00a0km) in length.[110]  There are many lakes in England; the largest is Windermere, within the aptly named Lake District.[111] Most of England's landscape consists of low hills and plains, with upland and mountainous terrain in the north and west of the country. The northern uplands include the Pennines, a chain of uplands dividing east and west, the Lake District mountains in Cumbria, and the Cheviot Hills, straddling the border between England and Scotland. The highest point in England, at 978 metres (3,209\u00a0ft), is Scafell Pike in the Lake District.[111] The Shropshire Hills are near Wales while Dartmoor and Exmoor are two upland areas in the south-west of the country. The approximate dividing line between terrain types is often indicated by the Tees\u2013Exe line.[112]  The Pennines, known as the \"backbone of England\", are the oldest range of mountains in the country, originating from the end of the Paleozoic Era around 300\u00a0million years ago.[113] Their geological composition includes, among others, sandstone and limestone, and also coal. There are karst landscapes in calcite areas such as parts of Yorkshire and Derbyshire. The Pennine landscape is high moorland in upland areas, indented by fertile valleys of the region's rivers. They contain two national parks, the Yorkshire Dales and the Peak District. In the West Country, Dartmoor and Exmoor of the Southwest Peninsula include upland moorland supported by granite.[114]  The English Lowlands are in the central and southern regions of the country, consisting of green rolling hills, including the Cotswold Hills, Chiltern Hills, North and South Downs; where they meet the sea they form white rock exposures such as the cliffs of Dover. This also includes relatively flat plains such as the Salisbury Plain, Somerset Levels, South Coast Plain and The Fens.  England has a temperate maritime climate: it is mild with temperatures not much lower than 0\u00a0\u00b0C (32\u00a0\u00b0F) in winter and not much higher than 32\u00a0\u00b0C (90\u00a0\u00b0F) in summer.[115] The weather is damp relatively frequently and is changeable. The coldest months are January and February, the latter particularly on the English coast, while July is normally the warmest month. Months with mild to warm weather are May, June, September and October.[115] Rainfall is spread fairly evenly throughout the year.  Important influences on the climate of England are its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, its northern latitude and the warming of the sea by the Gulf Stream.[115] Rainfall is higher in the west, and parts of the Lake District receive more rain than anywhere else in the country.[115] Since weather records began, the highest temperature recorded was 40.3\u00a0\u00b0C (104.5\u00a0\u00b0F) on 19 July 2022 at Coningsby, Lincolnshire,[116] while the lowest was \u221226.1\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221215.0\u00a0\u00b0F) on 10 January 1982 in Edgmond, Shropshire.[117]  The fauna of England is similar to that of other areas in the British Isles with a wide range of vertebrate and invertebrate life in a diverse range of habitats.[119] National nature reserves in England are designated by Natural England as key places for wildlife and natural features in England. They were established to protect the most significant areas of habitat and of geological formations. NNRs are managed on behalf of the nation, many by Natural England themselves, but also by non-governmental organisations, including the members of The Wildlife Trusts partnership, the National Trust, and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. There are 229 NNRs in England covering 939 square kilometres (363 square miles). Often they contain rare species or nationally important populations of plants and animals.[120] .   The Environment Agency is a non-departmental public body, established in 1995 and sponsored by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs with responsibilities relating to the protection and enhancement of the environment in England.[121] The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is the minister responsible for environmental protection, agriculture, fisheries and rural communities in England.[122] England has a temperate oceanic climate in most areas, lacking extremes of cold or heat, but does have a few small areas of subarctic and warmer areas in the South West. Towards the North of England the climate becomes colder and most of England's mountains and high hills are located here and have a major impact on the climate and thus the local fauna of the areas. Deciduous woodlands are common across all of England and provide a great habitat for much of England's wildlife, but these give way in northern and upland areas of England to coniferous forests (mainly plantations) which also benefit certain forms of wildlife. Some species have adapted to the expanded urban environment, particularly the red fox, which is the most successful urban mammal after the brown rat, and other animals such as common wood pigeon, both of which thrive in urban and suburban areas.[124]  The Greater London Built-up Area is by far the largest urban area in England[125] and one of the busiest cities in the world. It is considered a global city and has a population larger than any other country in the United Kingdom besides England itself.[125] Other urban areas of considerable size and influence tend to be in northern England or the English Midlands.[125] There are 50 settlements which have designated city status in England, while the wider United Kingdom has 66.  While many cities in England are quite large, such as Birmingham, Sheffield, Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Newcastle, Bradford, Nottingham, population size is not a prerequisite for city status.[126] Traditionally the status was given to towns with diocesan cathedrals, so there are smaller cities like Wells, Ely, Ripon, Truro and Chichester.    England's economy is one of the largest and most dynamic in the world, with an average GDP per capita of \u00a334,690.[5] HM Treasury, led by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is responsible for developing and executing the government's public finance policy and economic policy.[127] Usually regarded as a mixed market economy, it has adopted many free market principles, yet maintains an advanced social welfare infrastructure.[128]  The economy of England is the largest part of the UK's economy.[129] England is a leader in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors and in key technical industries, particularly aerospace, the arms industry, and the software industry. London, home to the London Stock Exchange, the United Kingdom's main stock exchange and the largest in Europe, is England's financial centre, with 100 of Europe's 500\u00a0largest corporations being based there.[130] London is the largest financial centre in Europe and as of 2014 is the second largest in the world.[131]  London has also been named as the fastest growing technology hub in Europe, with England having over 100 unique tech companies with a value of $1\u00a0billion or more.[132][133] The Bank of England, founded in 1694 as private banker to the government of England and a state-owned institution since 1946, is the United Kingdom's central bank.[134] The bank has a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in England and Wales, although not in other parts of the UK. The government has devolved responsibility to the bank's Monetary Policy Committee for managing the monetary policy of the country and setting interest rates.[135]  England is highly industrialised, but since the 1970s there has been a decline in traditional heavy and manufacturing industries, and an increasing emphasis on a more service industry oriented economy.[81] Tourism has become a significant industry, attracting millions of visitors to England each year. The export part of the economy is dominated by pharmaceuticals, automotives, crude oil and petroleum from the English parts of North Sea oil along with Wytch Farm, aircraft engines and alcoholic beverages.[136] The creative industries accounted for 7 per cent GVA in 2005 and grew at an average of 6 per cent per annum between 1997 and 2005.[137]  Agriculture is intensive, highly mechanised and efficient by European standards, producing 60% of food needs with only 2% of the labour force.[138] Two-thirds of production is devoted to livestock, the remainder to arable crops.[139] The main crops that are grown are wheat, barley, oats, potatoes, and sugar beets. England retains a significant fishing industry. Its fleets bring home a variety of fish, ranging from sole to herring. England is also rich in natural resources including coal, petroleum, natural gas, tin, limestone, iron ore, salt, clay, chalk, gypsum, lead, and silica.[140]  Prominent English figures from the field of science and mathematics include Sir Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Robert Hooke, Alan Turing, Stephen Hawking, Edward Jenner, Francis Crick, Joseph Lister, Joseph Priestley, Thomas Young, Christopher Wren and Richard Dawkins.  England was a leading centre of the Scientific Revolution from the 17th century.[141] As the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, England was home to many significant inventors during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Famous English engineers include Isambard Kingdom Brunel, best known for the creation of the Great Western Railway, a series of famous steamships, and numerous important bridges, revolutionising public transport and modern-day engineering.[142] Thomas Newcomen's steam engine helped spawn the Industrial Revolution.[143]  The Father of Railways, George Stephenson, built the first public inter-city railway line in the world, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which opened in 1830. With his role in the marketing and manufacturing of the steam engine, and invention of modern coinage, Matthew Boulton (business partner of James Watt) is regarded as one of the most influential entrepreneurs in history.[144] The physician Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine is said to have \"saved more lives\u00a0... than were lost in all the wars of mankind since the beginning of recorded history.\"[145]  Inventions and discoveries of the English include the jet engine; the first industrial spinning machine; the first computer and the first modern computer; the World Wide Web along with HTML; the first successful human blood transfusion; the motorised vacuum cleaner;[146] the lawn mower; the seat belt; the hovercraft; the electric motor; steam engines; and theories such as the Darwinian theory of evolution and atomic theory. Newton developed the ideas of universal gravitation, Newtonian mechanics, and calculus, and Robert Hooke his eponymously named law of elasticity. Other inventions include the iron plate railway, the thermosiphon, tarmac, the rubber band, the mousetrap, \"cat's eye\" road marker, joint development of the light bulb, steam locomotives, the modern seed drill and many modern techniques and technologies used in precision engineering.[147]  The Royal Society, formally The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge,[148] is a learned society and the United Kingdom's national academy of sciences. Founded on 28 November 1660,[148] It is the oldest national scientific institution in the world.[149] The Royal Institution of Great Britain was founded in 1799 by leading English scientists, including Henry Cavendish.[150] Some experts claim that the earliest concept of a metric system was invented by John Wilkins in 1668.[151]  Scientific research and development remains important in the universities of England, with many establishing science parks to facilitate production and co-operation with industry.[152] Cambridge is the most intensive research cluster for science and technology in the world.[153] In 2022, the UK produced 6.3 per cent of the world's scientific research papers and had a 10.5 per cent share of scientific citations, the third highest in the world (after the United States and China).[154] Scientific journals produced in England include Nature, the British Medical Journal and The Lancet. The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, and Minister of State for Science, Research and Innovation has responsibility for science in England.[155]  The Department for Transport is the government body responsible for overseeing transport in England. The department is run by the Secretary of State for Transport.   England has a dense and modern transportation infrastructure. There are many motorways in England, and many other trunk roads, such as the A1 Great North Road, which runs through eastern England from London to Newcastle[156] (much of this section is motorway) and onward to the Scottish border. The longest motorway in England is the M6, from Rugby through the North West up to the Anglo-Scottish border, a distance of 232 miles (373\u00a0km).[156] Other major routes include: the M1 from London to Leeds, the M25 which encircles London, the M60 which encircles Manchester, the M4 from London to South Wales, the M62 from Liverpool via Manchester to East Yorkshire, and the M5 from Birmingham to Bristol and the South West.[156]  Bus transport across the country is widespread; major companies include Arriva, FirstGroup, Go-Ahead Group, Mobico Group, Rotala and Stagecoach Group. Bus Rapid Transit originated in England with the Runcorn Busway opening in 1971.[157][158] The red double-decker buses in London have become a symbol of England. National Cycle Route offers cycling routes nationally.  Rail transport in England is the oldest in the world: passenger railways originated in England in 1825.[159] Much of Britain's 10,000 miles (16,000\u00a0km) of rail network lies in England, covering the country fairly extensively. There is rail transport access to France and Belgium through an undersea rail link, the Channel Tunnel, which was completed in 1994.  Great British Railways is a planned state-owned public body that will oversee rail transport in Great Britain from 2024. The Office of Rail and Road is responsible for the economic and safety regulation of England's railways.[160] Crossrail was Europe's largest construction project with a \u00a315\u00a0billion projected cost, opened in 2022.[161] High Speed 2, a new high-speed north\u2013south railway line, is under construction.[162]  There is a rapid transit network in two English cities: the London Underground, and the Tyne and Wear Metro in Newcastle upon Tyne, Gateshead and Sunderland.[163] There are several extensive tram networks, such as the Manchester Metrolink, Sheffield Supertram, West Midlands Metro, Nottingham Express Transit, and Tramlink in South London.[163] England also has extensive domestic and international aviation links. The largest airport is Heathrow, which is the world's second busiest airport measured by number of international passengers.[164]  By sea there is ferry transport, both local and international, including from Liverpool to Ireland and the Isle of Man, and Hull to the Netherlands and Belgium.[165] There are around 4,400 miles (7,100\u00a0km) of navigable waterways in England, half of which is owned by the Canal & River Trust,[165] however, water transport is very limited. The River Thames is the major waterway in England, with imports and exports focused at the Port of Tilbury in the Thames Estuary, one of the United Kingdom's three major ports.[165]  Successive governments have outlined numerous commitments to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Notably, the UK is one of the best sites in Europe for wind energy, and wind power production is its fastest growing supply.[167] Wind power contributed 26.8% of UK electricity generation in 2022.[168] England is home to Hornsea 2, the largest offshore wind farm in the world, situated in waters roughly 89 kilometres off the coast of Yorkshire.[169]  The Climate Change Act 2008 was passed in Parliament with an overwhelming majority across political parties. It sets out emission reduction targets that the UK must comply with legally. It represents the first global legally binding climate change mitigation target set by a country.[170] UK government energy policy aims to play a key role in limiting greenhouse gas emissions, while meeting energy demand. Shifting availabilities of resources and development of technologies also change the country's energy mix through changes in costs.[171]  The current energy policy is the responsibility of the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero and Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero.[172] The Minister of State for Business, Energy and Clean Growth is responsible for green finance, climate science and innovation, and low carbon generation.[173] In 2022, the United Kingdom was ranked 2 out of 180 countries in the Environmental Performance Index.[174] A law has been passed that UK greenhouse gas emissions will be net zero by 2050.[175]  The National Health Service (NHS), is the publicly funded healthcare system responsible for providing the majority of healthcare in the country. The NHS began on 5 July 1948, putting into effect the provisions of the National Health Service Act 1946. It was based on the findings of the Beveridge Report, prepared by the economist and social reformer, William Beveridge.[176] The NHS is largely funded by general taxation and National Insurance payments;[177] it provides most of its services free at the point of use, although there are charges for some people for eye tests, dental care, prescriptions and aspects of personal care.[178]  The government department responsible for the NHS is the Department of Health, under the Secretary of State for Health. Most of the department's expenses are on the NHS\u2014\u00a398.6\u00a0billion was spent in 2008\u20132009.[179] Regulatory bodies such as the General Medical Council and the Nursing and Midwifery Council are organised on a UK-wide basis, as are non-governmental bodies such as the Royal Colleges.  The average life expectancy is 77.5 years for males and 81.7 years for females, the highest of the four countries of the United Kingdom.[180] The south of England has a higher life expectancy than the north, but regional differences seem to be slowly narrowing: between 1991\u20131993 and 2012\u20132014, life expectancy in the North East increased by 6.0 years and in the North West by 5.8 years.[180]  With over 56\u00a0million inhabitants, England is by far the most populous country of the United Kingdom, accounting for 84% of the combined total.[3] England taken as a unit and measured against international states would be the 26th largest country by population in the world.[181]  The English people are British people.[182] There is an English diaspora in former parts of the British Empire; especially the United States, Canada, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand.[e] Since the late 1990s, many English people have migrated to Spain.[187] Due in particular to the economic prosperity of South East England, it has received many economic migrants from the other parts of the United Kingdom.[182] There has been significant Irish migration.[188] The proportion of ethnically European residents totals at 87.50%, including Germans[189] and Poles.[182] Other people from much further afield in the former British colonies have arrived since the 1950s: in particular, 6% of people living in England have family origins in the Indian subcontinent, mostly India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.[182][189] About 0.7% are Chinese.[182][189] 2.90% of the population are black, from Africa and the Caribbean, especially former British colonies.[182][189] In 2007, 22% of primary school children in England were from ethnic minority families,[190] and in 2011 that figure was 26.5%.[191] About half of the population increase between 1991 and 2001 was due to immigration.[192]  England contains one indigenous national minority, the Cornish people, recognised by the UK government under the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities in 2014.[193]  (thousands)[194]  English, today spoken by hundreds of millions of people around the world, originated in what is now England, where it remains the principal tongue. According to a 2011 census, it is spoken well or very well by 98% of the population[195] and is widely spoken around the world.[196]  English language learning and teaching is an important economic activity. There is no legislation mandating an official language for England,[197] but English is the only language used for official business. Despite the country's relatively small size, there are many distinct regional accents.  Cornish died out as a community language in the 18th century but is being revived,[198] and is now protected under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.[199] It is spoken by 0.1% of people in Cornwall,[200] and is taught to some degree in several primary and secondary schools.[201]  State schools teach students a second language or third language from the ages of seven, most commonly French, Spanish or German.[202] It was reported in 2007 that around 800,000 school students spoke a foreign language at home,[190] the most common being Punjabi and Urdu. However, following the 2011 census data released by the Office for National Statistics, figures now show that Polish is the main language spoken in England after English.[203] In 2022, British Sign Language became an official language of England when the British Sign Language Act 2022 came into effect.[204]  In the 2011 census, 59.4% of the population of England specified their religion as Christian, 24.7% answered that they had no religion, 5% specified that they were Muslim, while 3.7% of the population belongs to other religions and 7.2% did not give an answer.[205] Christianity is the most widely practised religion in England. The established church of England is the Church of England,[206] which left communion with Rome in the 1530s when Henry\u00a0VIII was unable to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. The church regards itself as both Catholic and Protestant.[207]  There are High Church and Low Church traditions and some Anglicans regard themselves as Anglo-Catholics, following the Tractarian movement. The monarch of the United Kingdom is the supreme governor of the Church of England, which has around 26\u00a0million baptised members (of whom the vast majority are not regular churchgoers). It forms part of the Anglican Communion with the Archbishop of Canterbury acting as its symbolic worldwide head.[208] Many cathedrals and parish churches are historic buildings of significant architectural importance, such as Westminster Abbey, York Minster, Durham Cathedral, and Salisbury Cathedral.  The second-largest Christian denomination is the Catholic Church. Since its reintroduction after the Catholic Emancipation, the Church has organised ecclesiastically on an England and Wales basis where there are 4.5\u00a0million members (most of whom are English).[209] There has been one Pope from England to date, Adrian IV, while saints Bede and Anselm are regarded as Doctors of the Church.  A form of Protestantism known as Methodism is the third largest Christian practice and grew out of Anglicanism through John Wesley.[210] It gained popularity in the mill towns of Lancashire and Yorkshire, and among tin miners in Cornwall.[211] There are other non-conformist minorities, such as Baptists, Quakers, Congregationalists, Unitarians and The Salvation Army.[212]  The patron saint of England is Saint George; his symbolic cross is included in the flag of England.[213] There are many other English and associated saints, including Cuthbert, Edmund, Alban, Wilfrid, Aidan, Edward the Confessor, John Fisher, Thomas More, Petroc, Piran, Margaret Clitherow and Thomas Becket. There are non-Christian religions practised. Jews have a history of a small minority on the island since 1070.[214] They were expelled from England in 1290 following the Edict of Expulsion, and were allowed back in 1656.[214]  Especially since the 1950s, religions from the former British colonies have grown in numbers, due to immigration. Islam is the most common of these, now accounting for around 5% of the population in England.[215] Hinduism, Sikhism and Buddhism are next in number, adding up to 2.8% combined,[215] introduced from India and Southeast Asia.[215]  A small minority of the population practise ancient Pagan religions. Neopaganism in the United Kingdom is primarily represented by Wicca and Neopagan witchcraft, Druidry, and Heathenry. According to the 2011 census, there are roughly 53,172 people who identify as Pagan in England,[f] including 11,026 Wiccans.[g] 24.7% of people in England declared no religion, compared with 14.6% in 2001.[216] Norwich had the highest such proportion at 42.5%, followed by Brighton and Hove at 42.4%.  The Department for Education is the government department responsible for issues affecting people in England up to the age of 19, including education.[217] State-funded schools are attended by approximately 93% of English schoolchildren.[218] Education is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Education.[219]   Children between the ages of 3 and 5 attend nursery or an Early Years Foundation Stage reception unit within a primary school. Children between the ages of 5 and 11 attend primary school, and secondary school is attended by those aged between 11 and 16. State-funded schools are obliged by law to teach the National Curriculum; basic areas of learning include English literature, English language, mathematics, science, art & design, citizenship, history, geography, religious education, design & technology, computing, ancient & modern languages, music, and physical education.[220] The Programme for International Student Assessment coordinated by the OECD currently ranks the overall knowledge and skills of British 15-year-olds as 13th in the world in literacy, mathematics, and science with the average British student scoring 503.7, well above the OECD average of 493.[221]  Although most English secondary schools are comprehensive, there are selective intake grammar schools to which entrance is subject to passing the eleven-plus exam. Around 7.2 per cent of English schoolchildren attend private schools, which are funded by private sources.[222] Standards in state schools are monitored by the Office for Standards in Education, and in private schools by the Independent Schools Inspectorate.[223]  After finishing compulsory education, students take GCSE examinations. Students may then opt to continue into further education for two years. Further education colleges (particularly sixth form colleges) often form part of a secondary school site. A-level examinations are sat by a large number of further education students, and often form the basis of an application to university. Further education covers a wide curriculum of study and apprenticeships, including T-levels, BTEC, NVQ and others. Tertiary colleges provide both academic and vocational courses.[224]  Higher education students normally attend university from age 18 onwards, where they study for an academic degree. There are over 90\u00a0universities in England, all but one of which are public institutions. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is the government department responsible for higher education in England.[225] Students are generally entitled to student loans to cover tuition fees and living costs.[h] The first degree offered to undergraduates is the bachelor's degree, which usually takes three years to complete. Students are then able to work towards a postgraduate degree, which usually takes one year, or a doctorate, which takes three or more years.[227]  England's universities include some of the highest-ranked universities in the world. As of 2024, four England-based universities, the University of Cambridge, University of Oxford, Imperial College London, and University College London, are ranked among the top ten in the 2024 QS World University Rankings. The University of Cambridge, founded in 1209, and the University of Oxford, founded in 1096, are the two oldest universities in the English-speaking world.[228]  The London School of Economics has been described as the world's leading social science institution for both teaching and research.[229] The London Business School is considered one of the world's leading business schools and in 2010 its MBA programme was ranked best in the world by the Financial Times.[230] Academic degrees in England are usually split into classes: first class, upper second class, lower second class, third, and unclassified.[227] The King's School, Canterbury and King's School, Rochester are the oldest schools in the English-speaking world.[231] Many of England's most well-known schools, such as Winchester College, Eton, St Paul's School, Harrow School and Rugby School are fee-paying institutions.[232]  Many ancient standing stone monuments were erected during the prehistoric period; among the best known are Stonehenge, Devil's Arrows, Rudston Monolith and Castlerigg.[233] With the introduction of Ancient Roman architecture there was a development of basilicas, baths, amphitheaters, triumphal arches, villas, Roman temples, Roman roads, Roman forts, stockades and aqueducts.[234] It was the Romans who founded the first cities and towns such as London, Bath, York, Chester and St Albans. Perhaps the best-known example is Hadrian's Wall stretching right across northern England.[234] Another well-preserved example is the Roman Baths at Bath, Somerset.[234]  Early medieval architecture's secular buildings were simple constructions mainly using timber with thatch for roofing. Ecclesiastical architecture ranged from a synthesis of Hiberno\u2013Saxon monasticism,[235][236] to Early Christian basilica and architecture characterised by pilaster-strips, blank arcading, baluster shafts and triangular headed openings. After the Norman conquest in 1066 various castles were created; the best known include the Tower of London, Warwick Castle, Durham Castle and Windsor Castle.[237]  Throughout the Plantagenet era, an English Gothic architecture flourished, with prime examples including the medieval cathedrals such as Canterbury Cathedral, Westminster Abbey and York Minster.[237] Expanding on the Norman base there was also castles, palaces, great houses, universities and parish churches. Medieval architecture was completed with the 16th-century Tudor style; the four-centred arch, now known as the Tudor arch, was a defining feature as were wattle and daub houses domestically. In the aftermath of the Renaissance a form of architecture echoing classical antiquity synthesised with Christianity appeared, the English Baroque style of architect Christopher Wren being particularly championed.[238]  Georgian architecture followed in a more refined style, evoking a simple Palladian form; the Royal Crescent at Bath is one of the best examples of this. With the emergence of romanticism during Victorian period, a Gothic Revival was launched. In addition to this, around the same time the Industrial Revolution paved the way for buildings such as The Crystal Palace. Since the 1930s various modernist forms have appeared whose reception is often controversial, though traditionalist resistance movements continue with support in influential places.[i]  Landscape gardening, as developed by Capability Brown, set an international trend for the English landscape garden. Gardening, and visiting gardens, are regarded as typically English pursuits. The English garden presented an idealized view of nature. At large country houses, the English garden usually included lakes, sweeps of gently rolling lawns set against groves of trees, and recreations of classical temples, Gothic ruins, bridges, and other picturesque architecture, designed to recreate an idyllic pastoral landscape.[241]  By the end of the 18th century, the English garden was being imitated by the French landscape garden, and as far away as Pavlovsk, Saint Petersburg, the gardens of the future Emperor Paul. It also had a major influence on the public parks and gardens which appeared around the world in the 19th century.[242] The English landscape garden was centred on the English country house and manor houses.[241]  English Heritage and the National Trust preserve great gardens and landscape parks throughout the country.[243] The RHS Chelsea Flower Show is held every year by the Royal Horticultural Society and is said to be the largest gardening show in the world.[244]  English folklore developed over many centuries. Some of the characters and stories are present across England, but most belong to specific regions. Common folkloric beings include pixies, giants, elves, bogeymen, trolls, goblins and dwarves. While many legends and folk-customs are thought to be ancient, such as the tales featuring Offa of Angel and Wayland the Smith,[245] others date from after the Norman invasion. The legends featuring Robin Hood and his Merry Men of Sherwood, and their battles with the Sheriff of Nottingham, are among the best-known of these.[246]  During the High Middle Ages tales originating from Brythonic traditions entered English folklore and developed into the Arthurian myth.[247][248][249] These were derived from Anglo-Norman, Welsh and French sources,[248] featuring King Arthur, Camelot, Excalibur, Merlin and the Knights of the Round Table such as Lancelot. These stories are most centrally brought together within Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain).[j]  Some folk figures are based on semi or actual historical people whose story has been passed down centuries.[251] On 5 November people celebrate Bonfire Night to commemorate the foiling of the Gunpowder Plot centred on Guy Fawkes. There are various national and regional folk activities, participated in to this day, such as Morris dancing, Maypole dancing, Rapper sword in the North East, Long Sword dance in Yorkshire, Mummers Plays, bottle-kicking in Leicestershire, and cheese-rolling at Cooper's Hill.[252] There is no official national costume, but a few are well established such as the Pearly Kings and Queens associated with cockneys, the Royal Guard, the Morris costume and Beefeaters.[253]  Since the early modern period the food of England has historically been characterised by its simplicity of approach and a reliance on the high quality of natural produce.[254] During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, English cuisine enjoyed an excellent reputation, though a decline began during the Industrial Revolution with increasing urbanisation. The cuisine of England has, however, recently undergone a revival, which has been recognised by food critics with some good ratings in Restaurant's best restaurant in the world charts.[255] Traditional examples of English food include the Sunday roast, featuring a roasted joint (usually beef, lamb, chicken or pork) served with assorted vegetables, Yorkshire pudding and gravy.[256] Other prominent meals include fish and chips and the full English breakfast (generally consisting of bacon, sausages, grilled tomatoes, fried bread, black pudding, baked beans, mushrooms and eggs).[257] Various meat pies are consumed, such as steak and kidney pie, steak and ale pie, cottage pie, pork pie (usually eaten cold)[256] and the Cornish pasty.  Sausages are commonly eaten, either as bangers and mash or toad in the hole. Lancashire hotpot is a well-known stew originating in the northwest. Some of the more popular cheeses are Cheddar, Red Leicester, Wensleydale, Double Gloucester and Blue Stilton. Many Anglo-Indian hybrid dishes, curries, have been created, such as chicken tikka masala and balti. Traditional English dessert dishes include apple pie or other fruit pies; spotted dick \u2013 all generally served with custard; and, more recently, sticky toffee pudding. Sweet pastries include scones served with jam or cream, dried fruit loaves, Eccles cakes and mince pies as well as sweet or spiced biscuits.  Common non-alcoholic drinks include tea[258] and coffee; frequently consumed alcoholic drinks include wine, ciders and English beers, such as bitter, mild, stout and brown ale.[259]  The earliest known examples are the prehistoric rock and cave art pieces, most prominent in North Yorkshire, Northumberland and Cumbria, but also feature further south, for example at Creswell Crags.[260] With the arrival of Roman culture in the 1st century, various forms of art such as statues, busts, glasswork and mosaics were the norm. There are numerous surviving artefacts, such as those at Lullingstone and Aldborough.[261] During the Early Middle Ages the style favoured sculpted crosses and ivories, manuscript painting, gold and enamel jewellery, demonstrating a love of intricate, interwoven designs such as in the Staffordshire Hoard discovered in 2009. Some of these blended Gaelic and Anglian styles, such as the Lindisfarne Gospels and Vespasian Psalter.[262] Later Gothic art was popular at Winchester and Canterbury, examples survive such as Benedictional of St. \u00c6thelwold and Luttrell Psalter.[263]  The Tudor era saw prominent artists as part of their court; portrait painting, which would remain an enduring part of English art, was boosted by German Hans Holbein, and natives such as Nicholas Hilliard built on this.[263] Under the Stuarts, Continental artists were influential especially the Flemish, examples from the period include Anthony van Dyck, Peter Lely, Godfrey Kneller and William Dobson.[263] The 18th century saw the founding of the Royal Academy; a classicism based on the High Renaissance prevailed, with Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds becoming two of England's most treasured artists.[263]  In the 19th century, John Constable and J. M. W. Turner were major landscape artists. The Norwich School continued the landscape tradition, while the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, led by artists such as Holman Hunt, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and John Everett Millais, revived the Early Renaissance style with their vivid and detailed style.[263] Prominent among 20th-century artists was Henry Moore, regarded as the voice of British sculpture, and of British modernism in general.[264] The Royal Society of Arts is an organisation committed to the arts.[265]  Early authors such as Bede and Alcuin wrote in Latin.[266] The period of Old English literature provided the epic poem Beowulf and the secular prose of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,[267] along with Christian writings such as Judith, C\u00e6dmon's Hymn and hagiographies.[266] Following the Norman conquest Latin continued among the educated classes, as well as an Anglo-Norman literature.  Middle English literature emerged with Geoffrey Chaucer, author of The Canterbury Tales, along with Gower, the Pearl Poet and Langland. William of Ockham and Roger Bacon, who were Franciscans, were major philosophers of the Middle Ages. Julian of Norwich, who wrote Revelations of Divine Love, was a prominent Christian mystic. With the English Renaissance literature in the Early Modern English style appeared. William Shakespeare, whose works include Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, and A Midsummer Night's Dream, remains one of the most championed authors in English literature.[268]  Christopher Marlowe, Edmund Spenser, Philip Sydney, Thomas Kyd, John Donne, and Ben Jonson are other established authors of the Elizabethan age.[269] Francis Bacon and Thomas Hobbes wrote on empiricism and materialism, including scientific method and social contract.[269] Filmer wrote on the Divine Right of Kings. Marvell was the best-known poet of the Commonwealth,[270] while John Milton authored Paradise Lost during the Restoration.  This royal throne of kings, this sceptred isle, this earth of majesty, this seat of Mars, this other Eden, demi-paradise; this fortress, built by nature for herself. This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England.  William Shakespeare.[271] Some of the most prominent philosophers of the Enlightenment were John Locke, Thomas Paine, Samuel Johnson and Jeremy Bentham. More radical elements were later countered by Edmund Burke who is regarded as the founder of conservatism.[272] The poet Alexander Pope with his satirical verse became well regarded. The English played a significant role in romanticism: Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, John Keats, Mary Shelley, Percy Bysshe Shelley, William Blake and William Wordsworth were major figures.[273]  In response to the Industrial Revolution, agrarian writers sought a way between liberty and tradition; William Cobbett, G. K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc were main exponents, while the founder of guild socialism, Arthur Penty, and cooperative movement advocate G. D. H. Cole are somewhat related.[274] Empiricism continued through John Stuart Mill and Bertrand Russell, while Bernard Williams was involved in analytics. Authors from around the Victorian era include Charles Dickens, the Bront\u00eb sisters, Jane Austen, George Eliot, Rudyard Kipling, Thomas Hardy, H. G. Wells and Lewis Carroll.[275] Since then England has continued to produce novelists such as George Orwell, D. H. Lawrence, Virginia Woolf, C. S. Lewis, Enid Blyton, Aldous Huxley, Agatha Christie, Terry Pratchett, J. R. R. Tolkien, and J. K. Rowling.[276]  The traditional folk music of England is centuries old and has contributed to several genres prominently; mostly sea shanties, jigs, hornpipes and dance music. It has its own distinct variations and regional peculiarities. Ballads featuring Robin Hood, printed by Wynkyn de Worde in the 16th century, are an important artefact, as are John Playford's The Dancing Master and Robert Harley's Roxburghe Ballads collections.[277] Some of the best-known songs are Greensleeves, Pastime with Good Company, Maggie May and Spanish Ladies among others. Many nursery rhymes are of English origin such as Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary, Roses Are Red, Jack and Jill, London Bridge Is Falling Down, The Grand Old Duke of York, Hey Diddle Diddle and Humpty Dumpty.[278] Traditional English Christmas carols include \"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\", \"The First Noel\", \"I Saw Three Ships\" and \"God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen\".   Early English composers in classical music include Renaissance artists Thomas Tallis and William Byrd, followed by Henry Purcell from the Baroque period and Thomas Arne who was well known for his patriotic song Rule, Britannia!. German-born George Frideric Handel spent most of his composing life in London and became a national icon in Britain, creating some of the most well-known works of classical music, especially his English oratorios, The Messiah, Solomon, Water Music, and Music for the Royal Fireworks.[279] Classical music attracted much attention in the 18th century with the formation of the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival, which was the longest running classical music festival of its kind until the final concerts in 1912. The English Musical Renaissance was a hypothetical development in the late 19th and early 20th century, when English composers, often those lecturing or trained at the Royal College of Music, were said to have freed themselves from foreign musical influences. There was a revival in the profile of composers from England in the 20th century led by Edward Elgar, Benjamin Britten, Frederick Delius, Gustav Holst, Ralph Vaughan Williams and others.[281] Present-day composers from England include Michael Nyman, best known for The Piano, and Andrew Lloyd Webber, whose musicals have achieved enormous success in the West End and worldwide.  In popular music, many English bands and solo artists have been cited as the most influential and best-selling musicians of all time. Acts such as the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Elton John, Queen, Rod Stewart, David Bowie, the Rolling Stones and Def Leppard are among the highest-selling recording artists in the world.[282] Many musical genres have origins in (or strong associations with) England, such as British invasion, progressive rock, hard rock, Mod, glam rock, heavy metal, Britpop, indie rock, gothic rock, shoegazing, acid house, garage, trip hop, drum and bass and dubstep.[283]  Large outdoor music festivals in the summer and autumn are popular, such as Glastonbury, V Festival, and the Reading and Leeds Festivals. England was at the forefront of the illegal, free rave movement from the late 1980s, which inspired the pan-European culture of teknivals.[284] The Boishakhi Mela is a Bengali New Year festival celebrated by the British Bangladeshi community. It is the largest open-air Asian festival in Europe. After the Notting Hill Carnival, it is the second-largest street festival in the UK, attracting over 80,000 visitors.  The most prominent opera house in England is the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden.[285] The Proms is a major annual cultural event in the English calendar.[285] The Royal Ballet is one of the world's foremost classical ballet companies. The Royal Academy of Music is the oldest conservatoire in the UK, founded in 1822, receiving its royal charter in 1830.[286] England is home to numerous major orchestras such as the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, the Philharmonia Orchestra, and the London Symphony Orchestra.[287] Other forms of entertainment that originated in England include the circus[288][289][290] and the pantomime.[291]  England has had a considerable influence on the history of the cinema, producing some of the greatest actors, directors and motion pictures of all time, including Alfred Hitchcock, Charlie Chaplin, David Lean, Laurence Olivier, Vivien Leigh, John Gielgud, Peter Sellers, Julie Andrews, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Helen Mirren, Kate Winslet and Daniel Day-Lewis. Hitchcock and Lean are among the most critically acclaimed filmmakers.[292] Hitchcock's The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog (1926) helped shape the thriller genre in film, while his 1929 Blackmail is often regarded as the first British sound feature film.[293]  Major film studios in England include Pinewood, Elstree and Shepperton. Some of the most commercially successful films of all time have been produced in England, including two of the highest-grossing film franchises (Harry Potter and James Bond).[294] Ealing Studios in London has a claim to being the oldest continuously working film studio in the world.[295] Famous for recording many motion picture film scores, the London Symphony Orchestra first performed film music in 1935.[296] The Hammer Horror films starring Christopher Lee saw the production of the first gory horror films showing blood and guts in colour.[297]  The BFI Top 100 British films includes Monty Python's Life of Brian (1979), a film regularly voted the funniest of all time by the UK public.[298] English producers are also active in international co-productions and English actors, directors and crew feature regularly in American films. The UK film council ranked David Yates, Christopher Nolan, Mike Newell, Ridley Scott and Paul Greengrass the five most commercially successful English directors since 2001.[299] Other contemporary English directors include Sam Mendes, Guy Ritchie and Richard Curtis. Current actors include Tom Hardy, Daniel Craig, Benedict Cumberbatch, Lena Headey, Felicity Jones, Emilia Clarke, Lashana Lynch, and Emma Watson. Acclaimed for his motion capture work, Andy Serkis opened The Imaginarium Studios in London in 2011.[300] The visual effects company Framestore in London has produced some of the most critically acclaimed special effects in modern film.[301] Many successful Hollywood films have been based on English people, stories or events. The 'English Cycle' of Disney animated films include Alice in Wonderland, The Jungle Book and Winnie the Pooh.[302]  English Heritage is a governmental body with a broad remit of managing the historic sites, artefacts and environments of England. It is currently sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. A non-governmental charity, the National Trust holds a complementary role, focussed on landscapes and country houses. 17 of the 25 United Kingdom UNESCO World Heritage Sites fall within England.[303] Some of the best-known of these are: Hadrian's Wall, Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites, the Tower of London, the Jurassic Coast, Saltaire, Ironbridge Gorge, Blenheim Palace and the Lake District.[304]  London's British Museum holds more than seven million objects,[305] one of the largest and most comprehensive collections in the world,[306] illustrating and documenting global human culture from its beginnings to the present. The British Library in London is the national library and is one of the world's largest research libraries, holding over 150\u00a0million items in almost all known languages and formats, including around 25\u00a0million books.[307][308] The National Gallery in Trafalgar Square houses a collection of over 2,300 paintings dating from the mid-13th century to 1900.[309] The Tate galleries house the national collections of British and international modern art; they also host the Turner Prize.[310]  The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport has overall responsibility for cultural property and heritage.[311][312] A blue plaque, the oldest historical marker scheme in the world, is a permanent sign installed in a public place in England to commemorate a link between that location and a famous person or event. In 2011 there were around 1,600 museums in England.[313] Entry to most museums and galleries is free.[314] London is one of the world's most visited cities, regularly taking the top five most visited cities in Europe. It is considered a global centre of finance, art and culture.[315]  The BBC, founded in 1922, is the UK's publicly funded radio, television and Internet broadcasting corporation, and is the oldest and largest broadcaster in the world.[317][318] It operates numerous television and radio stations in the UK and abroad and its domestic services are funded by the television licence.[319][320] The BBC World Service is an international broadcaster owned and operated by the BBC. It is the world's largest of any kind.[321] It broadcasts radio news, speech and discussions in more than 40 languages.[322][323]  London dominates the media sector in England: national newspapers and television and radio are largely based there, although Manchester is also a significant national media centre. The UK publishing sector, including books, directories and databases, journals, magazines and business media, newspapers and news agencies, has a combined turnover of around \u00a320\u00a0billion and employs around 167,000 people.[324] National newspapers produced in England include The Times, The Guardian, The Daily Telegraph, and the Financial Times.[325]  Magazines and journals published in England that have achieved worldwide circulation include Nature, New Scientist, The Spectator, Prospect, NME and The Economist. The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport has overall responsibility over media and broadcasting in England.[326]  England has a strong sporting heritage, and during the 19th century codified many sports that are now played around the world. Sports originating in England include association football,[327] cricket, rugby union, rugby league, tennis, boxing, badminton, squash,[328] rounders,[329] hockey, snooker, billiards, darts, table tennis, bowls, netball, thoroughbred horseracing, greyhound racing and fox hunting. It has helped the development of golf, sailing and Formula One.  Football is the most popular of these sports. The England national football team, whose home venue is Wembley Stadium, played Scotland in the first ever international football match in 1872.[330] Referred to as the \"home of football\" by FIFA, England hosted and won the 1966 FIFA World Cup.[331] With a British television audience peak of 32.30\u00a0million viewers, the final is the most watched television event ever in the UK.[332] England is recognised by FIFA as the birthplace of club football: Sheffield F.C., founded in 1857, is the world's oldest club.[327] The England women's national football team won the UEFA Euro 2022, hosted by England.[333]  Cricket is generally thought to have been developed in the early medieval period among the farming and metalworking communities of the Weald.[334] The England cricket team is a composite England and Wales team. One of the game's top rivalries is The Ashes series between England and Australia, contested since 1882. Lord's Cricket Ground situated in London is sometimes referred to as the \"Mecca of Cricket\".[335] After winning the 2019 Cricket World Cup, England became the first country to win the World Cups in football, rugby union, and cricket.[336]  William Penny Brookes was prominent in organising the format for the modern Olympic Games.[337] London has hosted the Summer Olympic Games three times, in 1908, 1948, and 2012. England competes in the Commonwealth Games, held every four years. Sport England is the governing body responsible for distributing funds and providing strategic guidance for sporting activity in England.  Rugby union originated in Rugby School, Warwickshire in the early 19th century.[338] The top level of club participation is the English Premiership. Rugby league was born in Huddersfield in 1895. Since 2008, the England national rugby league team has been a full test nation in lieu of the Great Britain national rugby league team, which won three World Cups. Club sides play in Super League, the present-day embodiment of the Rugby Football League Championship. Rugby League is most popular among towns in the northern English counties of Lancashire, Yorkshire and Cumbria.[339]  Golf has been prominent in England, due in part to its cultural and geographical ties to Scotland.[340] There are professional tours for men and women, in two main tours: the PGA and the European Tour. The world's oldest golf tournament, and golf's first major is The Open Championship, played both in England and Scotland. The biennial golf competition, the Ryder Cup, is named after English businessman Samuel Ryder.[341]  Tennis was created in Birmingham in the late 19th century, and the Wimbledon Championships is the oldest tennis tournament in the world, and widely considered the most prestigious.[342] Wimbledon has a major place in the English cultural calendar.[343]  In boxing, under the Marquess of Queensberry Rules, England has produced many world champions across the weight divisions internationally recognised by the governing bodies.[344]  Originating in 17th and 18th-century England, the thoroughbred is a horse breed best known for its use in horse racing. The National Hunt horse race the Grand National, is held annually at Aintree Racecourse in early April. It is the most watched horse race in the UK, and three-time winner Red Rum is the most successful racehorse in the event's history.[345]  The 1950 British Grand Prix at Silverstone was the first race in the newly created Formula One World Championship.[346][347] It has manufactured some of the most technically advanced racing cars, and many of today's racing companies choose England as their base of operations. England also has a rich heritage in Grand Prix motorcycle racing, the premier championship of motorcycle road racing, and produced several world champions.  Darts is a widely popular sport in England; a professional competitive sport, it is a traditional pub game.[348][349] Another popular sport commonly associated with pub games is snooker, and England has produced several world champions. The English are keen sailors and enjoy competitive sailing; founding and winning some of the world's most famous international competitive tournaments across the various race formats, including the match race, a regatta, and the America's Cup.  The St George's Cross has been the national flag of England since the 13th century. Originally the flag was used by the maritime Republic of Genoa. The English monarch paid a tribute to the Doge of Genoa from 1190 onwards so that English ships could fly the flag as a means of protection when entering the Mediterranean. A red cross was a symbol for many Crusaders in the 12th and 13th centuries, and became associated with Saint George.[350] Since 1606 the St George's Cross has formed part of the design of the Union Flag, a Pan-British flag designed by King James I.[213] During the English Civil War and Interregnum, the New Model Army's standards and the Commonwealth's Great Seal both incorporated the flag of Saint George.[351][352]  There are numerous other symbols and symbolic artefacts, both official and unofficial, including the Tudor rose, the nation's floral emblem, and the Three Lions featured on the Royal Arms of England. The Tudor rose was adopted as a national emblem of England around the time of the Wars of the Roses as a symbol of peace.[353] It is a syncretic symbol in that it merged the white rose of the Yorkists and the red rose of the Lancastrians. It is also known as the Rose of England.[354] The oak tree is a symbol of England: the Royal Oak symbol and Oak Apple Day commemorate the escape of King Charles II after his father's execution, when he hid in an oak to avoid detection by the parliamentarians before safely reaching exile.  The Royal Arms of England, a national coat of arms featuring three lions, originated with Richard the Lionheart in 1198. It is blazoned as gules, three lions passant guardant or and it provides one of the most prominent symbols of England. England does not have an official national anthem, as the United Kingdom as a whole has God Save the King. However, Jerusalem, Land of Hope and Glory (used for England during the 2002 Commonwealth Games),[355] and I Vow to Thee, My Country are often considered unofficial English national anthems. England's National Day is 23 April which is Saint George's Day: Saint George is the patron saint of England.[356]  53\u00b008\u2032N 1\u00b023\u2032W\ufeff \/ \ufeff53.13\u00b0N 1.38\u00b0W\ufeff \/ 53.13; -1.38 "},{"title":"Ball (association football)","content":"  A football (also known as a football ball, soccer ball, or association football ball specifically in the United Kingdom) is the ball used in the sport of association football. The name of the ball varies according to whether the sport is called \"football\", \"soccer\", or \"association football\". The ball's spherical shape, as well as its size, weight, mass, and material composition, are specified by Law 2 of the Laws of the Game maintained by the International Football Association Board.[1] Additional, more stringent standards are specified by FIFA and other big governing bodies for the balls used in the competitions they sanction.  Early footballs began as animal bladders or stomachs that would easily fall apart if kicked too much. Improvements became possible in the 19th century with the introduction of rubber and discoveries of vulcanization by Charles Goodyear. The modern 32-panel ball design was developed in 1962 by Eigil Nielsen, and technological research continues to develop footballs with improved performance. The 32-panel ball design was soon joined by 24-panel balls as well as 42-panel balls, both of which improved on performance prior to 2007.[citation needed]  A black-and-white patterned spherical truncated icosahedron design, brought to prominence by the Adidas Telstar, has become a symbol of association football.[2] Many different designs of balls exist, varying both in appearance and physical characteristics.[3]  In the year 1863, the first specifications for footballs were set by the Football Association. Previous to this, footballs were made out of inflated animal bladder, with later leather coverings to help footballs maintain their shapes.[4] In 1872 the specifications were revised, and have been kept essentially unchanged by the International Football Association Board. Differences in footballs made since this rule came into effect have been with the material used to create them.  Footballs have dramatically changed over time. During medieval times balls were normally made from an outer shell of leather filled with cork shavings.[5] Another method of creating a ball was using animal bladders to make it inflatable inside. However, these two styles of footballs were easy to puncture and were inadequate for kicking.  It was not until the 19th century that footballs developed a more modern appearance.  In 1838, Charles Goodyear introduced vulcanized rubber, which dramatically improved football.[6] Vulcanization is the treatment of rubber to give it certain qualities such as strength, elasticity, and resistance to solvents. Vulcanization of rubber also helps the football resist moderate heat and cold.  Vulcanization helped create inflatable bladders that pressurize the outer panel arrangement of the football. Charles Goodyear's innovation increased the bounce ability of the ball and made it easier to kick. Most balls of this time had tanned leather with eighteen sections stitched together. These were arranged in six panels of three strips each.[7][8]  During the 1900s, footballs were made out of leather with a lace of the same material (known as tiento in Spanish) used to stitch the panels. Although leather was perfect for bouncing and kicking the ball, when heading the football (hitting it with the player's head) it was usually painful. This problem was most probably due to water absorption of the leather from rain, which caused a considerable increase in weight, causing head or neck injury. By around 2017, this had also been associated with dementia in former players.[9] Another problem of early footballs was that they deteriorated quickly, as the plastic used in manufacturing the basketballs varied in thickness and in quality.[7]  The ball without the leather lace was developed and patented by Romano Polo, Antonio Tossolini and Juan Valbonesi in 1931 in Bell Ville, C\u00f3rdoba Province, Argentina.[10][11] This innovative ball (named Superball) was adopted by the Argentine Football Association as the official ball for its competitions since 1932.[12]  The deformation of the football when it is kicked or when the ball hits a surface is tested. Two styles of footballs have been tested by the Sports Technology Research Group of Wolfson School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering in Loughborough University; these two models are called the Basic FE model and the Developed FE model of the football. The basic model considered the ball as a spherical shell with isotropic material properties. The developed model also used isotropic material properties but included an additional stiffer stitching seam region.  Manufacturers are experimenting with microchips and even cameras embedded inside the ball. The microchip technology was considered for the goal-line technology. The ball used in the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia had an embedded chip which did not provide any measurements, but provided 'user experience' via smartphone after connecting with the ball via NFC.[13][14][15]  Companies such as Umbro, Mitre, Adidas, Nike, Select and Puma are releasing footballs made out of new materials which are intended to provide more accurate flight and more power to be transferred to the football.[16][17]  Modern footballs are much more complex than past footballs. Most footballs consist of twelve regular pentagonal and twenty regular hexagonal panels positioned in a truncated icosahedron spherical geometry.[5] Some premium-grade 32-panel balls use non-regular polygons to give a closer approximation to sphericality.[18] The inside of the football is made up of a latex or butyl rubber bladder which enables the football to be pressurised. The ball's outside is made of leather, synthetic leather, polyurethane or PVC panels. The surface can be textured, weaved or embossed for greater control and touch. The panel pairs are either machine-stitched, hand-stitched or thermo-bonded (glued and bonded by heat) along the edge.[6] To prevent water absorption balls may be specially coated, or the stitches bonded with glue. The size of a football is roughly 22\u00a0cm (8.66 inches) in diameter for a regulation size 5 ball. Rules state that a size 5 ball must be 68 to 70\u00a0cm (27 to 28\u00a0in) in circumference.[19] Averaging that to 69\u00a0cm (27\u00a0in) and then dividing by \u03c0 gives a diameter of about 22\u00a0cm (8.7\u00a0in).  Regulation size and weight for a football is a circumference of 68\u201370\u00a0cm (27\u201328\u00a0in) and a weight of between 410\u2013450\u00a0g (14\u201316\u00a0oz).  The ball is inflated to a pressure of 0.6\u20131.1 bars (8.7\u201316.0\u00a0psi) at sea level.[20] This is known as \"Size 5\". Smaller balls, sizes 1, 3 and 4 are also produced for younger players or as training tools.[20]  There are different types of football balls depending on the match and turf including training footballs, match footballs, professional match footballs, beach footballs, street footballs, indoor footballs, turf balls, futsal footballs and mini\/skills footballs.[21]  Many companies throughout the world produce footballs. The earliest balls were made by local suppliers where the game was played. It is estimated that 40% of all footballs are made in Sialkot, Pakistan with other major producers being China and India.[22]  As a response to the problems with the balls in the 1962 FIFA World Cup,[clarification needed] Adidas created the Adidas Santiago[23] \u2013 this led to Adidas winning the contract to supply the match balls for all official FIFA and UEFA matches, which they have held since the 1970s, and also for the Olympic Games.[24] They also supply the ball for the UEFA Champions League which is called the Adidas Finale.  In early FIFA World Cups, match balls were mostly provided by the hosts from local suppliers. Records indicate a variety of models being used within individual tournaments and even, on some occasions, individual games. Over time, FIFA took more control over the choice of ball used. Since 1970 Adidas have supplied official match balls (all of which were made in Sialkot, Pakistan) for every tournament.[25]  The most up-to-date balls used in various club football competitions as of 2023\u201324 season are:  Adidas Finale London (UCL)  Adidas Finale Bilbao (UWCL)  Nike Flight[28]  Malaysia Cup  Malaysia FA Cup  MFL Cup  Piala Sumbangsih  The association football symbol (U+26BD \u26bd SOCCER BALL) was introduced by computing standard Unicode.[29] The symbol was representable in HTML as &#9917; or &#x26BD;.[citation needed] The addition of this symbol follows a 2008 proposal by Karl Pentzlin.[30] "},{"title":"Scoring in association football","content":"  In games of association football, teams compete to score the most goals during the match. A goal is scored when the ball passes completely over a goal line at either end of the field of play between two centrally positioned upright goal posts 24\u00a0feet (7.32\u00a0m) apart and underneath a horizontal crossbar at a height of 8\u00a0feet (2.44\u00a0m) \u2014 this frame is itself referred to as a goal. Each team aims to score at one end of the pitch, while preventing their opponents from scoring at the other end. Nets are usually attached to the goal frame to catch goalscoring balls, but the ball is not required to touch the net.  Rules concerning goal scoring are described in Law 10 of the Laws of the Game:  A goal is scored when the whole of the ball passes over the goal line, between the goalposts and under the crossbar, provided that no offence has been committed by the team scoring the goal. As with other cases of the ball travelling out of the field of play, all of the ball must cross all of the line, otherwise play continues.[2] A goal is credited to the team attacking the goal scored upon, regardless of which team actually caused the ball to enter the goal. A ball entering a goal from the action of a player defending that goal is called an own goal.  If the ball hits the frame of the goal and remains in play, play continues. Goals can be scored going in off the goal frame.  Even if serious foul play unambiguously prevents a goal from being scored, the referee cannot award a goal unless the ball enters the goal as described above; i.e., there is no provision for awarding a goal akin to the awarded goal in ice hockey, the penalty try in rugby football, or the goaltending offence in basketball (although such a provision did once exist, as described below).  A goal cannot be scored directly from a dropped ball, indirect free kick or a throw-in. Should the ball go into the opponents' goal from these without first being touched by another player, play is restarted with a goal kick. A player cannot score an own goal directly from any restart of play (other than, theoretically, a penalty kick); in that case a corner kick would be awarded. Both of these situations, especially the latter, are exceedingly rare.  As a result of rule-changes introduced in 2019, it is not possible to score an attacking goal with the hands or arm.  If a goalkeeper throws the ball directly into the opponent's goal from his\/her own penalty area, no goal is awarded: instead a goal-kick is awarded to the defending side.[3]  In practice such a situation is improbable given the distances involved, but this can occur in variations of the sport where the Laws are adapted to play on a smaller area.[4] If the ball goes directly into the opponent's goal from the hands or arm of a player in any other circumstances, the handling is penalised as a handball offence (even if it was unintentional, or would otherwise have been legal).[5] It remains possible to score an own goal with the hands or arm.  The 2019 rule changes also provided that a goal cannot be scored if the ball enters either goal directly after touching a match official; a dropped ball is awarded if this occurs.[1]  If a player or team official is illegally on the field of play when that person's team scores a goal, the goal is disallowed, with a direct free kick being awarded to the opposing side.[6]  After a goal is scored, play is restarted with a kick-off by the side which conceded the goal.  Most goals are relatively unambiguous, as the ball will usually strike the net attached to the goal structure indicating that it has passed over the goal line as described above. Occasionally, however, situations occur where it is difficult for officials to tell if the ball completely crossed the goal line before a rebound, save, or clearance from the goal area. Additionally, even if the ball crosses the goal line as required, a goal may be disallowed if the attacking team commits an infringement of the Laws of the Game, such as the offside offence or a foul.  As with all other decisions on the Laws of the Game, the referee is the final authority as to whether a goal is scored. The match referee is advised by assistant referees, whose view across the pitch from the sidelines may in some cases be more useful in determining whether the ball crossed the goal line or whether the attacking team committed an infringement.  Goals incorrectly awarded or disallowed due to mistakes in determining if the ball crossed the line are referred to as ghost goals. The goal net was one of the earliest tools employed to aid match officials in determining whether a goal was scored. Introduced in the 1890s, the goal net provides a simple way to help determine whether the ball passed on the correct side of the goal posts and crossbar. Although not mandated by the Laws of the Game, goal nets are now ubiquitous across most levels of organised football. Since 2012, goal-line technology has been used at the highest levels of professional football; it employs a system of cameras and\/or sensors to provide the referee with a discreet signal when the ball has crossed the goal line.[7] The video assistant referee was added in 2018 after years of trials; this is an additional assistant referee who constantly monitors video footage of the match and is empowered to advise the referee if he\/she makes \"clear and obvious errors\" in matters, including in the awarding of goals.  The Laws make no mention of attributing goals to individual players. Nevertheless, goals are almost always attributed to individuals, that player being the one who provided the final action causing the goal to be scored. Generally, this is the last player to touch the ball, notwithstanding inconsequential deflections such as failed attempts at a save. Should a player cause a goal to be scored against their own team, the goal is recorded as an own goal.  The authority on attributing goals varies between competitions. The Premier League in England has a dedicated Dubious Goals Committee for resolving attribution disputes.[8]  For an individual player, scoring multiple goals in a game is considered a notable achievement. In association football, a hat-trick refers to the uncommon feat of scoring three goals in a single game. Awards exist for individual players who score the most goals in some competitions, such awards are often called the \"Golden Boot\".  Players will typically celebrate scoring a goal with team mates, occasionally putting on elaborate displays for the crowd. The Laws allow this, but mandate that celebration must not be \"excessive\".[9]  On average, only a few scores occur per game in association football.  An analysis of several years' results from several English leagues found that 1\u20130 was the most common result, occurring in approximately 20% of games.[15]  In English traditional football, the object of the game was typically to convey a ball into a specified area, or to touch a specific object (the area or object often being called the \"goal\")[16][17][18] defended by the opposing team.  This feat might itself be called a \"goal\";[19] alternative names such as \"inn\"[16] were also in use.  The game might be decided by a fixed number of goals (e.g. first goal scored wins or best of three)[20][21][22] or be played for a fixed period of time.  In the more formalised football games of English public schools and universities, the object was typically to kick the ball between goal-posts guarded by the opposition.  This might be required to be above a crossbar (as in the game of football played at Rugby School),[23] below a bar or other object (as in the Sheffield Rules of 1862)[24] or at any height (as at Shrewsbury School).[25]  The size and type of goals were among the first questions decided by the Football Association (FA).  At its second meeting, on 10 November 1863, the FA agreed on the following three resolutions:[41]  The next meeting, on 17 November, added the further condition that a goal could not be scored when the ball was \"thrown, knocked or carried\" between the posts.[41]   These points were reflected in the first draft of the Laws of the Game created by FA secretary E. C. Morley.[42]  Morley's proposal met with objections expressed in correspondence from J. C. Thring of Uppingham School, and also from William Chesterman of Sheffield F. C.,[43] principally on the grounds that it would be difficult to judge whether a ball that went above the height of the posts should count as a goal; Thring correctly predicted that a crossbar \"w[ould] be adopted in the end\".[44]  Nevertheless, this feature of the game was preserved in the Association's first published set of laws, which read:[45]  A goal shall be won when the ball passes between the goal posts or over the space between the goal posts (at whatever height), not being thrown, knocked on, or carried  At the first revision of the FA rules, in 1866, a tape was introduced between the posts at a height of 8 feet, with a goal counting only if the ball went below this tape.[46]  According to a contemporary newspaper report of the meeting:[47]  The chairman urged some strong reasons why a goal should not be won so long as the ball was between the posts at no matter what height, and quoted an instance which occurred at Reigate, where one of the opposite side raised the ball quite 90 feet in the air between the goal posts.  A dispute arose as to whether the goal was won or not, and the bystanders decided that the ball was kicked between the posts, but he thought it was a most unsatisfactory goal, and was therefore decidedly in favour of goals being kicked under the tape In 1875, after a proposal by Queen's Park FC, the laws allowed the option of using either a crossbar or tape.[48] At the International Football Conference of December 1882, it was decided to require a crossbar;[49]  this change was introduced into the Football Association's laws in 1883.[50]  The dimensions of the goal (8 yards wide and 8 feet high) have remained unchanged since 1866.  The original FA laws of 1863 disallowed a goal when the ball was \"thrown, knocked on, or carried\",[45]  even if the handling was otherwise legal.[51] In 1882, a change in the laws, introduced by Nicholas Lane Jackson of Finchley FC and Morton Betts of Old Harrovians FC, made it possible to score an own goal by use of the hands.[52]  In 1962, a change introduced by the Scottish Football Association permitted a goal-keeper to score a goal by throwing the ball into the opposing goal from his own penalty area.[53] This innovation was heavily criticised in some quarters.[54] In 1974, a further change to the laws allowed a goal to be scored when the ball was handled unintentionally by an attacker.[55] In 2019 both of these changes were reversed:   The original laws of the game, in 1863, specified no punishments for infringements of the rules.[56]  In 1872, the indirect free kick was introduced as a punishment for handball.[57]  This indirect free-kick was thought to be an inadequate remedy for a handball which prevented an otherwise-certain goal.  From a meeting of the Sheffield Football Association in February 1879, we have the following report:[58][59]  It was proposed by Mr. T. Banks, on behalf of the Norfolk Club, to add to law 8 \u2014 \"If any player of the defending side, except the goalkeeper, stop the ball with his hands within three yards of the goal, when it is going in goal, it shall count a goal to the opponents.\"[60] After a \"long and noisy discussion\", the change was rejected. At the 1881 meeting of the Football Association, a similar proposal was introduced by J. Arnall and J. B. Clayton of the Birmingham Football Association, but it was likewise rejected.[61]  Such a law was finally approved the next year, to become part of the FA's laws for the 1882-83 season:  When any player, other than the goal-keeper, wilfully stops a ball in the vicinity of his own goal by using his hands when, in the opinion of the umpires or referee, the ball would have passed through the goal, a goal shall be scored to his opponents.[62] This goal, which was similar to today's penalty try in rugby, survived as part of the game for only one season.  At the International Football Conference of December 1882, it was decided to remove this law from the 1883-84 season.[63][64]  One commentator wrote that the rule \"was the means of causing the referee a very awkward point to decide at times, and we all know the duties of the referee are heavy enough without this; and, further, the penalty, in my opinion, is too great [...]  A free kick [...] is quite sufficient\".[65]  The laws have at various times restricted the ability to score from a set piece situation (such as a free kick or corner-kick). If the ball goes into the goal directly from such a restart but the laws do not permit the awarding of a goal, depending on which team performed the set piece a goal kick or corner kick is awarded. "},{"title":"Major League Soccer","content":"  Major League Soccer (MLS) is a men's professional soccer league sanctioned by the United States Soccer Federation, which represents the sport's highest level in the United States.[2][3] The league comprises 29 teams\u201426 in the United States and 3 in Canada\u2014since the 2023 season.[4][5] MLS is headquartered in Midtown Manhattan.  Major League Soccer is the most recent in a series of men's premier professional national soccer leagues established in the United States and Canada. The predecessor of MLS was the North American Soccer League (NASL), which existed from 1968 until 1984.[6] MLS was founded in 1993 as part of the United States' successful bid to host the 1994 FIFA World Cup.[7] The inaugural season took place in 1996 with ten teams.[8] MLS experienced financial and operational struggles in its first few years, losing millions of dollars and folding two teams in 2002.[9] Since then, developments such as the proliferation of soccer-specific stadiums around the league, implementation of the Designated Player Rule allowing teams to sign star players such as David Beckham, and national TV contracts have made MLS profitable.[10] In 2022, with an average attendance of over 21,000 per game, MLS has the fourth-highest average attendance of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada, behind the National Football League (NFL) with over 69,000 fans per game and Major League Baseball (MLB) with over 26,000 fans per game, and the Canadian Football League (CFL) with over 21,700 fans per game.[11][12] MLS was the eighth-highest attended professional soccer league worldwide by 2018.[13]  The MLS regular season typically starts in late February or early March and runs through mid-October, with each team playing 34\u00a0games;[14][15] the team with the best record is awarded the Supporters' Shield. Eighteen teams compete in the postseason MLS Cup Playoffs in late October and November, culminating in the league's championship game, the MLS Cup.[16]  Instead of operating as an association of independently owned clubs, MLS is a single entity in which each team is owned by the league and individually operated by the league's investors.[17] The league has a fixed membership like most sports leagues in the United States and Canada, which makes it one of the few soccer leagues that does not use a promotion and relegation process.[18]  The LA Galaxy have the most MLS Cups, with five. They are also tied with D.C. United for most Supporters' Shields, with four each. The Columbus Crew are the defending champions, as they defeated Los Angeles FC 2\u20131 on December 9, 2023, to mark the end of the 2023 season.  Major League Soccer's regular season runs from late February or early March to October. Teams are geographically divided into the Eastern and Western Conferences, playing 34 games in an unbalanced schedule. With 29 teams in 2023, each team plays two games, home and away, against every team in its conference and one game against all but four or five of the teams in the opposite conference. The 2020 season was the first season in league history in which teams did not play against every other team in the league.[19] At the end of the regular season, the team with the highest point total is awarded the Supporters' Shield and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.[20]  Teams break for the annual All-Star Game midway through the season, an exhibition game containing the league's best players. The format of the All-Star Game has changed several times since the league's inception; 2020 was the first year in which the MLS All-Stars were planned to play against an all-star team from Mexico's Liga MX, before the event's cancellation due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[21][22][23]  Unlike most major soccer leagues around the world, but similar to other leagues in the Americas,[24] the MLS regular season is followed by a postseason knockout tournament to determine the league champion.[25] As of 2023[update], eighteen teams participate in the MLS Cup Playoffs in October and November, which concludes with the MLS Cup championship game in early December.[26] The 2023 playoff format includes a pair of single-elimination play-in matches for the two lowest-ranked teams in each conference ahead of a best-of-three round; the round is followed by more single-elimination rounds that lead up to the MLS Cup final.[27]  Major League Soccer's spring-to-fall schedule results in scheduling conflicts with the FIFA calendar and with summertime international tournaments such as the World Cup and the Gold Cup,[28] causing some players to miss league matches.[29] While MLS has looked into changing to a fall-to-spring format, there are no current plans to do so. Were the league to change its schedule, a winter break would be necessary to accommodate teams located in harsh winter climates.[30][31][32] It would also have to compete with the popularity and media presence of the National Football League (NFL), National Basketball Association (NBA), and National Hockey League (NHL), which all run on fall-to-spring schedules.[32]  MLS teams also play in other international and domestic competitions. Each season, up to five MLS teams\u2014four from the U.S. and one from Canada\u2014play in the CONCACAF Champions Cup (CCC) against other clubs from the CONCACAF region. Two U.S.-based MLS teams qualify based on regular-season results from the previous year: the teams with the highest point total from each of the two conferences, one of whom is the Supporter's Shield champion. The third U.S. team to qualify is the reigning MLS Cup champion. A fourth U.S.-based team can qualify by winning the U.S. Open Cup.[33] In 2024, the league will send eight teams to participate in the U.S. Open Cup instead of every U.S.-based club, with MLS Next Pro teams as representatives for some teams. MLS had announced their intention to remove itself from the tournament entirely,[34] but reached a compromise with U.S. Soccer to send representatives from clubs that were not participating in the Champions Cup, with the exception of the defending Open Cup champions.[35][36] If a team qualifies through multiple berths, or if any of the three MLS berths are taken by a Canadian team, the berth is reallocated to the highest-placed U.S.-based team in the previous season's overall table that has otherwise not qualified. Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver compete against other Canadian sides in the Canadian Championship for the one CONCACAF Champions Cup berth allocated to Canada.[37] Seattle Sounders FC became the first MLS team to win the CONCACAF Champions Cup under the competition's updated format in 2022.[38][39]  Since 2018, the reigning MLS Cup champion plays in the Campeones Cup, a Super Cup-style single game against the Campe\u00f3n de Campeones from Liga MX, hosted by the MLS team in September.[40] The inaugural edition saw Tigres UANL defeat Toronto FC at BMO Field in Toronto in 2018.[41]  Another inter-league competition with Liga MX, the Leagues Cup, was established in 2019.[42] The 2020 edition of the tournament was originally planned to pair eight MLS clubs against eight Liga MX clubs in a single-elimination tournament hosted in the United States, reviving an inter-league rivalry that previously took place in the now-defunct North American Superliga, before its cancelation.[23] Beginning with the 2023 edition all MLS and Liga MX teams participate in the competition, which functions as the regional cup for the North American zone of CONCACAF.[43]  The 29 teams of Major League Soccer are divided between the Eastern and Western conferences. MLS has regularly expanded since the 2005 season, most recently with the addition of St. Louis City SC for the 2023 season.[44] San Diego FC is planned to enter the league in 2025.[45]  The league features numerous rivalry cups that are contested by two or more teams, usually geographic rivals.[46] Each trophy is awarded to the team with the best record in matches during the regular season involving the participating teams. The concept is comparable to rivalry trophies played for by American college football teams.[47]  MLS features some of the longest travel distances for a domestic soccer league, with Vancouver Whitecaps FC and Inter Miami CF the furthest apart teams at 2,801 miles (4,508\u00a0km).[48] During the 2018 season, the team with the shortest distance traveled over the entire regular schedule was Toronto FC at 25,891 miles (41,668\u00a0km), while the longest was Vancouver at 51,178 miles (82,363\u00a0km).[49]  Notes  Major League Soccer is the most recent of a series of men's premier professional national soccer leagues established in the United States and Canada. The predecessor of MLS was the North American Soccer League (NASL), which existed from 1968 until 1984.[50] The United States did not have a truly national top-flight league with FIFA-sanctioning until the creation of the NASL. The first league to have U.S. and Canadian professional clubs, the NASL struggled until the mid-1970s when the New York Cosmos, the league's most prominent team, signed a number of the world's best players including Pel\u00e9 and Franz Beckenbauer.[51] Pel\u00e9's arrival attracted other well-known international stars to the league including Johan Cruyff, Gerd M\u00fcller, Eus\u00e9bio, Bobby Moore, and George Best. Despite dramatic increases in attendance (with some matches drawing over 70,000 fans such as Soccer Bowl '78, the highest attendance to date for any club soccer championship in the United States) over-expansion, the economic recession of the early 1980s, and disputes with the players union ultimately led to the collapse of the NASL following the 1984 season, leaving the United States without a top-level soccer league until MLS.[52][53]  In 1988, in exchange for FIFA awarding the right to host the 1994 World Cup, U.S. Soccer promised to establish a Division 1 professional soccer league.[54] In 1993, U.S. Soccer selected Major League Professional Soccer (the precursor to MLS) as the exclusive Division 1 professional soccer league.[54] Major League Soccer was officially formed in February 1995 as a limited liability company.[54]  Tab Ramos was the first player signed by MLS, on January 3, 1995, and was assigned to the New York\/New Jersey MetroStars.[55] MLS began play in 1996 with ten teams. The first game was held on April 6, 1996, as the San Jose Clash defeated D.C. United before 31,000 fans at Spartan Stadium in San Jose in a game broadcast on ESPN.[56] The league had generated some buzz by managing to lure some marquee players from the 1994 World Cup to play in MLS\u2014including U.S. stars such as Alexi Lalas, Tony Meola and Eric Wynalda, and foreign players such as Mexico's Jorge Campos and Colombia's Carlos Valderrama.[57] D.C. United won the MLS Cup in three of the league's first four seasons.[58] The league added its first two expansion teams in 1998\u2014the Miami Fusion and the Chicago Fire; the Chicago Fire won its first title in its inaugural season.[59]  After its first season, MLS suffered from a decline in attendance.[60] The league's low attendance was all the more apparent in light of the fact that eight of the original ten teams played in large American football stadiums.[59] One aspect that had alienated fans was that MLS experimented with rules deviations in its early years in an attempt to \"Americanize\" the sport. The league implemented the use of shootouts to resolve tie games. MLS also used a countdown clock and halves ended when the clock reached 0:00. The league realized that the rule changes had alienated some traditional soccer fans while failing to draw new American sports fans, and the shootout and countdown clock were eliminated after the 1999 season.[61] The league's quality was cast into doubt when the U.S. men's national team, which was made up largely of MLS players, finished in last place at the 1998 World Cup.[59]  Major League Soccer lost an estimated $250\u00a0million during its first five years, and more than $350\u00a0million between its founding and 2004.[62][63][64][65] The league's financial problems led to Commissioner Doug Logan being replaced by Don Garber, a former NFL executive, in August 1999.[66] Following decreased attendance and increased losses by late 2001, league officials planned to fold but were able to secure new financing from owners Lamar Hunt, Philip Anschutz, and the Kraft family to take on more teams.[67] MLS announced in January 2002 that it had decided to contract the Tampa Bay Mutiny and Miami Fusion, leaving the league with ten teams.[68]  Despite the financial problems, though, MLS did have some accomplishments that would set the stage for the league's resurgence. Columbus Crew Stadium, now known as Historic Crew Stadium, was built in 1999, becoming MLS's first soccer-specific stadium.[69] This began a trend among MLS teams to construct their own venues instead of leasing American football stadiums, where they would not be able to generate revenue from other events.[70][71] In 2000, the league won an antitrust lawsuit, Fraser v. Major League Soccer, that the players had filed in 1996. The court ruled that MLS's policy of centrally contracting players and limiting player salaries through a salary cap and other restrictions were a legal method for the league to maintain solvency and competitive parity since MLS was a single entity and therefore incapable of conspiring with itself.[72]  The 2002 FIFA World Cup, in which the United States unexpectedly made the quarterfinals, coincided with a resurgence in American soccer and MLS.[46] MLS Cup 2002 drew 61,316 spectators to Gillette Stadium, the largest attendance in an MLS Cup final until 2018.[73] MLS limited teams to three substitutions per game in 2003, and adopted International Football Association Board (IFAB) rules in 2005.[74]  MLS underwent a transition in the years leading up to the 2006 World Cup. After marketing itself on the talents of American players, the league lost some of its homegrown stars to prominent European leagues. For example, Tim Howard was transferred to Manchester United for $4 million in one of the most lucrative contract deals in league history.[75][76] Many more American players did make an impact in MLS. In 2005, Jason Kreis became the first player to score 100 career MLS goals.[77]  The league's financial stabilization plan included teams moving out of large American football stadiums and into soccer-specific stadiums.[68] From 2003 to 2008, the league oversaw the construction of six additional soccer-specific stadiums, largely funded by owners such as Lamar Hunt and Phil Anschutz, so that by the end of 2008, a majority of teams were now in soccer-specific stadiums.[59]  It was also in this era that MLS expanded for the first time since 1998. Real Salt Lake and Chivas USA began play in 2005, with Chivas USA becoming the second club in Los Angeles.[78] By 2006 the San Jose Earthquakes owners, players and a few coaches moved to Texas to become the expansion Houston Dynamo, after failing to build a stadium in San Jose. The Dynamo became an expansion team, leaving their history behind for a new San Jose ownership group that formed in 2007.[79]  In 2007, the league expanded beyond the United States' borders into Canada with the Toronto FC expansion team.[80] Major League Soccer took steps to further raise the level of play by adopting the Designated Player Rule, which helped bring international stars into the league.[81] The 2007 season witnessed the MLS debut of David Beckham. Beckham's signing had been seen as a coup for American soccer, and was made possible by the Designated Player Rule. Players such as Cuauht\u00e9moc Blanco (Chicago Fire) and Juan Pablo \u00c1ngel (New York Red Bulls), are some of the first Designated Players who made major contributions to their clubs.[82] The departures of Clint Dempsey and Jozy Altidore, coupled with the return of former U.S. national team stars Claudio Reyna and Brian McBride, highlighted the exchange of top prospects to Europe for experienced veterans to MLS.[83]  By 2008, San Jose had returned to the league under new ownership, and in 2009, the expansion side Seattle Sounders FC began play in MLS.[80] The Sounders set a new average attendance record for the league, with 30,943 spectators per match, and were the first expansion team to qualify for the playoffs since 1998.[84] The 2010 season ushered in an expansion franchise in the Philadelphia Union and their new PPL Park stadium (now known as Subaru Park).[80] The 2010 season also brought the opening of the New York Red Bulls' soccer-specific stadium, Red Bull Arena, and the debut of French striker Thierry Henry.[85]  The 2011 season brought further expansion with the addition of the Vancouver Whitecaps FC, the second Canadian MLS franchise, and the Portland Timbers.[86] Real Salt Lake reached the finals of the 2010\u201311 CONCACAF Champions League.[87] During the 2011 season, the Galaxy signed another international star in Republic of Ireland all-time leading goalscorer Robbie Keane.[88] MLS drew an average attendance of 17,872 in 2011, higher than the average attendances of the NBA and NHL.[89] In 2012, the Montreal Impact became the league's 19th franchise and the third in Canada, and made their home debut in front of a crowd of 58,912,[90] while the New York Red Bulls added Australian all-time leading goalscorer Tim Cahill.  In 2012, with an average attendance of over 18,000 per game, MLS had the third highest average attendance of any sports league in the U.S. after the National Football League (NFL) and Major League Baseball (MLB),[91] and was the seventh highest attended professional soccer league worldwide as of 2013[update].[92]  In 2013, MLS introduced New York City FC[93] as its 20th team, and Orlando City Soccer Club[94] as its 21st team, both of which would begin playing in 2015.  In 2013, the league implemented its \"Core Players\" initiative, allowing teams to retain key players using retention funds instead of losing the players to foreign leagues.[95] Among the first high-profile players re-signed in 2013 using retention funds were U.S. national team regulars Graham Zusi and Matt Besler. Beginning in summer of 2013 and continuing in the run up to the 2014 World Cup, MLS began signing U.S. stars based abroad, including Clint Dempsey, Jermaine Jones, and Michael Bradley from Europe; and DaMarcus Beasley from Mexico's Liga MX.[96] By the 2014 season, fifteen of the nineteen MLS head coaches had previously played in MLS.[97] By 2013, the league's popularity had increased to the point where MLS was as popular as Major League Baseball among 12- to 17-year-olds, as reported by the 2013 Luker on Trends ESPN poll, having jumped in popularity since the 2010 World Cup.[98][99]  In 2014, the league announced Atlanta United FC as the 22nd team to start playing in 2017.[100] Even though New York City FC and Orlando City were not set to begin play until 2015, each team made headlines during the summer 2014 transfer window by announcing their first Designated Players\u2014Spain's leading scorer David Villa and Chelsea's leading scorer Frank Lampard to New York, and Ballon d'Or winner Kak\u00e1 to Orlando.[101] The 2014 World Cup featured 21 MLS players on World Cup rosters and a record 11 MLS players playing for foreign teams\u2014including players from traditional powerhouses Brazil (J\u00falio C\u00e9sar) and Spain (David Villa); in the U.S. v. Germany match the U.S. fielded a team with seven MLS starters.[102]  On September 18, 2014, MLS unveiled their new logo as part of a branding initiative. In addition to the new crest logo, MLS teams display versions in their own colors on their jerseys.[103] Chivas USA folded following the 2014 season, while New York City FC and Orlando City SC joined the league in 2015 as the 19th and 20th teams.[104] Sporting Kansas City and the Houston Dynamo moved from the Eastern Conference to the Western Conference in 2015 to make two 10-team conferences.[104][105]  In early 2015, the league announced that two teams\u2014Los Angeles FC and Minnesota United FC\u2014would join MLS in either 2017 or 2018.[106] The 20th season of MLS saw the arrivals of several players who have starred at the highest levels of European club soccer and in international soccer: Giovanni dos Santos, Kak\u00e1, Andrea Pirlo, Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard, Didier Drogba, David Villa, and Sebastian Giovinco.[107] MLS confirmed in August 2016 that Minnesota United would begin play in 2017 along with Atlanta United FC.[108]  In April 2016, the league's commissioner Don Garber reiterated the intention of the league to expand to 28 teams, with the next round of expansion \"likely happening in 2020\".[109][110] In December 2016, he updated the expansion plans stating that the league will look to approve the 25th and 26th teams in 2017 and to start play in 2020.[111] In January 2017, the league received bids from 12 ownership groups.[112]  In July 2017, it was reported that Major League Soccer had rejected an offer by MP & Silva to acquire all television rights to the league following the conclusion of its current contracts with Fox, ESPN, and Univision, where MP & Silva insisted that the deal would be conditional on Major League Soccer adopting a promotion and relegation system. The league stated that it rejected the offer due to the exclusive periods that the current rightsholders have to negotiate extensions to their contracts. Additionally, media noted that Major League Soccer has long-opposed the adoption of promotion and relegation, continuing to utilize the fixed, franchise-based model used in other U.S. sports leagues.[18][113] Furthermore, MP & Silva founder Riccardo Silva also owned Miami FC of the NASL, which stood to benefit from such a promotion and relegation system.[113]  In October 2017, Columbus Crew owner Anthony Precourt announced plans to move the franchise to Austin, Texas by 2019.[114] The announcement spawned a league-wide backlash and legal action against the league by the Ohio state government.[115] On August 15, 2018, the Austin City Council voted to approve an agreement with Precourt to move Crew SC to Austin, and on August 22, 2018, the club's new name, Austin FC, was announced.[116] After negotiations between Precourt and Jimmy Haslam, owner of the Cleveland Browns, were announced, MLS made it clear that Austin would receive an expansion team only after a deal to sell Columbus to a local buyer had completed.[117] The purchase of Crew SC by Haslam's group was finalized in late December 2018,[118] and on January 15, 2019, Austin FC was officially announced as a 2021 MLS entry.[119]  MLS announced on December 20, 2017, that it would be awarding an expansion franchise to Nashville, Tennessee, to play in a yet-to-be-built 27,000-seat soccer-specific stadium, Nashville Fairgrounds Stadium, and would join MLS in 2020.[120] The management of the Nashville franchise announced in February 2019 that the MLS side would assume the Nashville SC name then in use by the city's USL Championship team.[121]  On January 29, 2018, MLS awarded Miami an expansion team, led by David Beckham. Inter Miami CF started MLS play on March 1, 2020, and plan on opening the proposed 25,000-seat stadium sometime in the near future.[122] An expansion team was awarded to Cincinnati, Ohio on May 29, 2018, to the ownership group of USL's FC Cincinnati. The team, which assumed the existing FC Cincinnati name, started MLS play in 2019 and moved to the new 26,000-seat TQL Stadium in 2021.[123]  The league planned to expand to 30 teams with the addition of Austin FC in 2021,[119] Charlotte in 2022,[124] and Sacramento and St. Louis in 2023; however, this was reduced to 29 after Sacramento Republic FC's bid was placed on indefinite hold.[44][125][5][126] Commissioner Don Garber has suggested that another round of expansion could lead to 32 teams in MLS.[127]  The league suspended its 2020 season on March 12, 2020, after two weeks, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, and other U.S.-based sports leagues did the same.[128][129][130] The 2020 season resumed in July with the MLS is Back Tournament, a competition in which 24 out of the 26 teams competed at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Orlando for a spot in the CONCACAF Champions League. In September 2020, the league announced the formation of MLS Next, an academy league for MLS academy teams from the under-13 to under-19 level.[131]  In 2022, the league signed a $2.5 billion deal with Apple Inc. that will make Apple TV the primary broadcaster for all MLS games. The agreement will see both MLS and Leagues Cup games shared across the streaming service.[132]  In May 2023, the league announced it would expand to 30 teams with the addition of San Diego FC for the 2025 season.[133]  In 2005, Toronto FC's ownership paid $10 million (about $15.6\u00a0million in today's dollars)[134] to join the league in 2007; San Jose paid $20 million the next year, and the fee had risen to $30 million when Sounders FC paid the fee in 2007 to join the league in 2009.[135] In 2013, New York City FC agreed to pay a record $100 million expansion fee for the right to join MLS in 2015.[136] This record was surpassed by the ownership groups of FC Cincinnati and Nashville SC, which each paid $150 million to join MLS 2019 and 2020, respectively.[137] Despite being announced in January 2018, Inter Miami CF only paid a $25 million expansion fee due to a clause in part-owner David Beckham's original playing contract signed in 2007.[138] $150 million was paid as an effective entrance fee by a group that bought Columbus Crew in 2018, which led to that team's previous operator receiving rights to Austin FC, which joined MLS in 2021.[139][140] MLS has also announced the ownership groups of the 28th and 29th teams would each pay a $200 million entrance fee.[136]  As of the 2023 season, 32 different clubs have competed in the league, with 15 having won at least one MLS Cup, and 16 winning at least one Supporters' Shield.[141] The two trophies have been won by the same club in the same year on eight occasions (two clubs have accomplished the feat twice).[142]  Major League Soccer operates under a single-entity structure in which teams and player contracts are centrally owned by the league.[3][143][144] Each team has an investor-operator that is a shareholder in the league.[145] In order to control costs, MLS shares revenues and holds players contracts instead of players contracting with individual teams. In Fraser v. Major League Soccer, a lawsuit filed in 1996 and decided in 2002, the league won a legal battle with its players in which the court ruled that MLS was a single entity that can lawfully centrally contract for player services.[3] The court also ruled that even absent their collective bargaining agreement, players could opt to play in other leagues if they were unsatisfied.[3]  Having multiple clubs operated by a single investor was a necessity in the league's first ten years.[146] At one time, Phil Anschutz's AEG operated six MLS franchises and Lamar Hunt's Hunt Sports operated three franchises. In order to attract additional investors, in 2002 the league announced changes to the operating agreement between the league and its teams to improve team revenues and increase the incentives to be an individual club operator.[147] These changes included granting operators the rights to a certain number of players they develop through their club's academy system each year, sharing the profits of Soccer United Marketing, and being able to sell individual club jersey sponsorships.[147]  As MLS appeared to be on the brink of overall profitability in 2006 and developed significant expansion plans, MLS announced that it wanted each club to have a distinct operator.[148] The league has attracted new investors that have injected more money into the league.[149] Examples include Red Bull's purchase of the MetroStars from AEG in 2006 for over $100\u00a0million.[146][150] For the 2014 season, the league assumed control of the former Chivas USA club, which had suffered from mismanagement and poor financial results under its individual operator relationship.[151][152] The league eventually dissolved the team,[153] in favor of awarding rights to a second soccer club in the Los Angeles area to a new investor group on October 30, 2014.[154]  The league now has 29 investor-operators for its 29 current clubs, with no member of any club's investor group having a stake in that of any other club. Since December 2015, when AEG sold its remaining 50% interest in the Houston Dynamo, the former multiple-team operators AEG and Hunt Sports, with the LA Galaxy and FC Dallas respectively, now only control one franchise.[155][156]  Don Garber has been the commissioner of Major League Soccer since 1999, serving as the league's chief executive. The league's first commissioner was Doug Logan, who served in the role from 1995 to 1999.[157][158]  Mark Abbott, a former MLS business partner, has served as the league's president and Deputy Commissioner since 2006.[159]  In 2016, the average salary for MLS players was $373,094,[160] lower than the average salaries in England's second-tier EFL Championship ($420,000 in 2015),[161] the Netherlands' Eredivisie ($445,000),[162] or Mexico's Liga MX ($418,000 in 2015).[163] The league's minimum player salary increased in 2017 to $65,000 for most players, and roster players #25\u201330 saw their minimum salary increased to $53,000.[164][165]  MLS salaries are limited by a salary cap, which MLS has had in place since the league's inception in 1996. The purpose of the salary cap is to prevent the team's owners from unsustainable spending on player salaries and to prevent a competitive imbalance among teams.[54] The salary cap survived a legal challenge by the players in the Fraser v. Major League Soccer lawsuit. The 2017 salary cap increased to $3.845 million per team.[164][165] Each team is allowed up to 30 players on its first team roster.[166] All 30 players are eligible for selection to each 18-player game-day squad during the regular season and playoffs.  Teams may augment their squads by signing players from other leagues. MLS has two transfer windows\u2014the primary pre-season transfer window lasts three months from mid February until mid May, and the secondary mid season transfer window runs one month from early July to early August.[167] When an MLS club sells one of its players overseas, the club and the league split the transfer revenues, with the club retaining from 33% to 75% depending on the player's status and tenure.[168] MLS teams have a limited number of international roster slots that they can use to sign non-domestic players. However, MLS teams often obtain green cards for their non-domestic players in order to qualify them for domestic status and thus free up international roster slots.[169] In 2015, 49% of MLS players were born outside of the U.S. and Canada, with players from 58 countries represented.[170][171]  MLS has a set of pool goalkeepers who are signed to a contract with the league and are loaned to teams during emergencies in which they are missing a goalkeeper due to injuries or suspensions.[172] The pool goalkeeper trains with an MLS club or an affiliated team when not assigned to a team; some pool goalkeepers, including Tim Melia, have gone on to be signed to permanent contract with their assigned teams.[173] In the past, when rosters were smaller, there were multiple goalkeepers signed to the pool, however, in recent years only one or two keepers are signed as team rosters are much larger.[174]  MLS has also introduced various initiatives and rules intended to improve quality of players while still maintaining the salary cap. Rules concerning Designated Players and allocation money allow for additional wage spending that is exempt from the salary cap. These initiatives have brought about an increase in on-field competition.[175][unreliable source?]  The designated player (DP) rule allows teams to sign a limited number of players whose salary exceeds the maximum cap; in 2017, each DP player only counted as $480,625 (the maximum non-DP salary) against the cap. Instituted in 2007, England's David Beckham was the first signing under the DP rule.[81] The DP rule has led to large income inequality in MLS with top DPs earning as much as 180 times more than a player earning the league minimum.[176] In the 2013 season, 21% of the league's wage spending went to just five players; this stretched to 29% on the top 6 players in the 2014 season.[177][178][unreliable source?]  The league's \"Core Players\" initiative allows teams to re-sign players using retention funds that do not count against the salary cap.[95] Retention funds were implemented in 2013 as a mechanism for MLS to retain key players; among the first high-profile players re-signed using retention funds were U.S. national team regulars Graham Zusi and Matt Besler.[95] MLS teams can also obtain allocation money, which is money that the team can use on player salaries that does not count against the cap, and teams can earn allocation money in several ways, such as from the transfer fees earned by selling players to teams in other leagues.[179] MLS teams can also use Targeted Allocation Money (often referred to as TAM), an initiative announced in 2015. Teams can use TAM funds to attract high-profile players by \"buying down\" contracts of players to below the Designated Player level.[180] High-profile players for which TAM funds were used include Hector Villalba, Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 and Giorgio Chiellini.  MLS has introduced various initiatives and rules intended to develop young players. Rules concerning Generation Adidas players and home grown players provide incentives for clubs to develop and retain young players.[175]  MLS has required all of its teams to operate youth development programs since 2008.[181] MLS roster rules allow teams to sign an unlimited number of players straight from their academies and bypassing the draft process.[182] There is also supplementary salary budget made by MLS only for homegrown players that are registered using senior roster slots called homegrown player funds.[183] One of the most prominent and lucrative examples of success in \"home-grown\" development was Jozy Altidore, who rose to prominence as a teenager in MLS before his record transfer fee $10\u00a0million move to Villarreal in Spain in 2008.[184] The various MLS teams' development academies play matches in a U.S. Soccer developmental league against youth academies from other leagues such as the North American Soccer League (NASL), which had been a Division II league prior to 2018, and USL Pro, originally a Division III league but now the Division II USL Championship.[185]  The league operates a Generation Adidas program, which is a joint venture between MLS and U.S. Soccer that encourages young American players to enter MLS.[186] The Generation Adidas program has been in place since 1997, and has introduced players such as Landon Donovan, Clint Dempsey, Tim Howard and Michael Bradley into MLS. Players under the Home Grown Player rule are signed to Generation Adidas contracts,[167] all players on Generation Adidas contracts are \"off budget players\" and their salaries do not count against the cap.  MLS has operated reserve leagues, which give playing time to players who were not starters for their MLS teams, during two different periods. The MLS Reserve League was formed in 2005, and operated through 2014 (with the exception of the 2009 & 2010 seasons).[187] MLS began integrating its Reserve League with the league then known as USL Pro in 2013,[188] and after the 2014 season folded the Reserve League, with MLS then requiring all teams to either affiliate with a USL team or field their own reserve side in that league. However, this requirement was never strictly enforced, and MLS eventually relaunched its reserve league in 2022 under the banner of MLS Next Pro. In the inaugural 2022 season, 19 of the league's then-current clubs, plus future club St. Louis City SC, fielded reserve sides in Next Pro. In the 2023 season, the only MLS teams that will not field Next Pro sides are CF Montr\u00e9al and D.C. United.[189][190]  Following the folding of the Development Academy,[191] MLS announced its own development league in 2020.[192] It includes all of the MLS team academies as well as 95 clubs across the country; many of which were a part of the Development Academy.[citation needed]  Since 1999, the league has overseen the construction of twelve stadiums specifically designed for soccer. The development of soccer-specific stadiums owned by the teams has generated a better gameday experience for the fans.[193] The soccer-specific stadiums have yielded positive financial results as teams were no longer required to pay to rent out facilities and gained control over revenue streams such as concessions, parking, naming rights, and the ability to host non-MLS events.[152][193] Several teams have doubled their season tickets following the team's move into a soccer-specific stadium.[194] The establishment of soccer-specific stadiums is considered the key to the league and the ability of teams to turn a profit.[195] In 2006, Tim Leiweke, then CEO of Anschutz Entertainment Group, described the proliferation of soccer-specific stadiums as the turning point for MLS.[195]  Columbus Crew owner Lamar Hunt started this trend in 1999 by constructing Columbus Crew Stadium, now known as Historic Crew Stadium, as MLS's first soccer-specific stadium.[69] The Los Angeles Galaxy followed four years later with the opening of the Home Depot Center, now Dignity Health Sports Park, in 2003.[196] FC Dallas opened Pizza Hut Park, now Toyota Stadium, in 2005, and the Chicago Fire began playing their home games in Toyota Park, now SeatGeek Stadium, in 2006. The 2007 season brought the opening of Dick's Sporting Goods Park for the Colorado Rapids and BMO Field for Toronto FC.[197]  Near the end of the 2008 season, Rio Tinto Stadium (now known as America First Field) became the home of Real Salt Lake, which meant that for the first time in MLS history a majority of MLS's teams (8 out of 14) played in soccer-specific stadiums.[198] Red Bull Arena, the new home of the New York Red Bulls opened for the start of the 2010 season,[199] and the Philadelphia Union opened PPL Park, now Subaru Park, in June 2010, midway through their inaugural season.[200]  The following season, in 2011, the Portland Timbers made their MLS debut in a newly renovated Jeld-Wen Field, now renamed Providence Park, which was originally a multi-purpose venue but turned into a soccer-specific facility.[201] Also in 2011, Sporting Kansas City moved to new Livestrong Sporting Park, now Children's Mercy Park.[202] The Houston Dynamo relocated to their new home at BBVA Compass Stadium, now Shell Energy Stadium, in 2012.[199] In the same year, the Montreal Impact joined the league in an expanded Stade Saputo, which reopened in June 2012, when renovations pushed the seating capacity to over 20,000. The Impact has used Olympic Stadium for early season matches and for games that require a larger capacity.[203] The San Jose Earthquakes, who had played at Buck Shaw Stadium from 2008 until 2014, opened their new Avaya Stadium (now PayPal Park) before the 2015 season.[204] Orlando City SC intended to begin constructing its soccer-specific stadium, now known as Exploria Stadium, in 2014 to be completed in 2015.[205] Delays caused by changes to the stadium plans pushed back the new venue's opening, first to late 2016 and finally to the start of the 2017 season.[206] Orlando City played at the Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium, now Camping World Stadium, while awaiting the construction of their new venue through the 2016 season. Exploria Stadium hosted its first MLS match on March 5, 2017, against New York City FC as Orlando City Stadium.  The development of additional MLS stadiums has continued to progress.  D.C. United had played their home games at former NFL and Major League Baseball venue RFK Stadium. In 2013, D.C. United announced the signing of a public-private partnership term sheet to build a new soccer stadium in Washington, D.C., and a final deal was reached in late 2014. In late February 2017,  D.C. United finally broke ground on their new stadium, Audi Field.[207] After 21 years of playing at RFK Stadium, DC United played their first game at Audi field in July 2018.  Two teams have announced their desire to build a soccer-specific stadium, although these teams have not finalized the stadium site and received all necessary government approvals. New York City FC play home games at Yankee Stadium, a Major League Baseball venue, although they intend to move into a soccer-specific stadium in the future. The New England Revolution play home games at Gillette Stadium which is an NFL Stadium also owned by the Revolution's owner, Robert Kraft. The team are currently in discussion with the City of Boston regarding a potential soccer-specific stadium in South Boston.[208]  Several remaining clubs play in stadiums not originally built for MLS and have not announced plans to move. The Seattle Sounders FC play at Lumen Field, a dual-purpose facility used for both American football and soccer. The Vancouver Whitecaps FC joined the league with Portland in 2011 and temporarily held matches at Empire Field before moving into the refurbished BC Place in October 2011,[209] a retractable-roof stadium that hosts Canadian football as well as soccer.[210]  Of the three teams that made their MLS debuts in 2017 and 2018, one opened a soccer-specific stadium in 2019, a second is playing in a shared football stadium, and the last opened a soccer-specific stadium for its inaugural 2018 season. Minnesota United FC, which debuted in 2017, built Allianz Field in St. Paul which hosted its inaugural game against New York City FC on April 13, 2019.[211][212] Until that time, the team played in Minneapolis at TCF Bank Stadium (now Huntington Bank Stadium), home to University of Minnesota football.[213] Atlanta United FC began play in 2017 at a college football facility, Georgia Tech's Bobby Dodd Stadium, before moving into its permanent home at the retractable-roof Mercedes-Benz Stadium, which it shares with the NFL's Atlanta Falcons; the two teams share a common owner and the stadium is equipped with screens to cordon off the upper tiers for most matches.[214] Los Angeles FC, which began play in 2018, opened Banc of California Stadium (now BMO Stadium) on the former site of the Los Angeles Sports Arena in April of its inaugural season.[215]  FC Cincinnati made its MLS debut in 2019 at Nippert Stadium, the football home of the University of Cincinnati. The stadium had been home to FCC's USL Championship predecessor for all of its three seasons of play. The club moved within Cincinnati to the new TQL Stadium in 2021.[216] Inter Miami began play in 2020 at Inter Miami CF Stadium, now known as DRV PNK Stadium, at the former site of Lockhart Stadium in Fort Lauderdale before opening Miami Freedom Park in the future.[217] Nashville SC played the 2020 and 2021 seasons at an NFL facility, the Tennessee Titans' Nissan Stadium, before opening Geodis Park in 2022.[218] Austin FC opened Q2 Stadium for its first season in 2021.[119] St. Louis City SC opened CityPark in November 2022, a few months before the club's first season in 2023.[219]  Major League Soccer began to demonstrate positive signs of long-term profitability as early as 2004 with the single-entity ownership structure, salary cap, and the media and marketing umbrella Soccer United Marketing (SUM) all contributing towards MLS's financial security.[63] As soccer-specific stadiums are built, ownership expands, and television coverage increases, MLS has seen its revenues increase while controlling costs.[9]  Television coverage and revenue have increased since the league's early years. In 2006, MLS reached an 8-year TV deal with ESPN spanning the 2007\u20132014 seasons, and marked the first time that MLS earned rights fees, reported to be worth $7\u20138\u00a0million annually.[221] In September 2012 the league extended its distribution agreement with London-based Media rights agency MP & Silva until 2014 in a deal worth $10\u00a0million annually. Total league TV revenues are over $40\u00a0million annually.[222][223] In 2011, MLS earned $150\u00a0million when it sold a 25% stake in SUM.[9]  In early 2005, MLS signed a 10-year, $150\u00a0million sponsorship deal with Adidas for its jerseys and other equipment.[63] In 2007, MLS teams started selling ad space on the front of jerseys to go along with the league-wide sponsorship partners who had already been advertising on the back of club jerseys, following the practice of international sport, specifically soccer. MLS established a floor of $500,000 per shirt sponsorship, with the league receiving a flat fee of $200,000 per deal.[252] As of July 2014, sixteen teams had signed sponsorship deals to have company logos placed on the front of their jerseys (and another team is directly owned by its shirt sponsor), and the league average from jersey sponsors was about $2.4\u00a0million.[253] Sleeve sponsorship was introduced to MLS in the 2020 season, with the teams able to sell a 2-by-2-inch (51 by 51\u00a0mm) section on the right arm where the league logo patch is normally positioned.[254]  The Los Angeles Galaxy made a profit in 2003 in their first season at The Home Depot Center,[62] and FC Dallas turned a profit after moving into Pizza Hut Park in 2005.[255] For each season between 2006 and 2009, two to three MLS clubs (generally clubs with a soccer-specific stadium) were reported as profitable by the league.[255][256][257]  By 2012 the league had shown a marked improvement in its financial health. In November 2013, Forbes published a report that revealed that ten of the league's nineteen teams earned an operating profit in 2012, while two broke even and seven had a loss. Forbes estimated that the league's collective annual revenues were $494\u00a0million, and that the league's collective annual profit was $34 million. Forbes valued the league's franchises to be worth $103\u00a0million on average, almost three times as much as the $37\u00a0million average valuation in 2008. The Seattle Sounders FC franchise was named the most valuable at $175\u00a0million, a 483% gain over the $30 million league entrance fee it paid in 2009.[152]  The trend in increased team values has continued with MLS teams seeing a strong 52% increase in franchise values from 2012 to 2014. In August 2015 Forbes updated its MLS franchise values with the most profitable team measuring $245 million and the least $105 million. The average value jumped from $103 to $157 million.[10]  As of 2018 Forbes estimates Atlanta United FC is the most valuable MLS team, worth $330 million, while the Colorado Rapids are the lowest value, at $155 million.[258] These valuations do not include the value of stadiums or training facilities owned by the respective clubs.  Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, MLS teams typically used commercial flights to transport players and staff between matches, with only four charter flights allowed under league rules.[259] These commercial flights were often non-direct, requiring transfers and layovers, and contributed to long travel days.[260] The number of charters allowed for league matches was increased to eight legs prior to the 2020 season and lifted entirely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[261][262] Sun Country Airlines has provided charter service to MLS teams since 2020 and became the league's official carrier in 2022.[263]  When the league began play, it tried to gain popularity by \"Americanizing\" the game: the game clock counted down in each half and stopped for certain dead ball situations and games level at the end of regulation were resolved with a running penalty shootout.[264]  Now MLS follows the rules and standards of the International Football Association Board (IFAB). Since 2005, the playoff extra time structure follows IFAB standards: two full 15-minute periods, followed by a penalty shootout if necessary.  U.S. Soccer hired the first full-time professional referees in league history in 2007 as part of the league's \"Game First\" initiatives.[265] Major League Soccer has been implementing fines and suspensions since the 2011 season for simulation (diving) through its Disciplinary Committee, which reviews plays after the match. The first player fined under the new rule was Charlie Davies, fined $1,000 for intentionally deceiving match officials.[266]  MLS uses the list of banned substances published by the World Anti-Doping Agency.[267]  The current MLS logo debuted in 2014, ahead of the league's 20th season, replacing an earlier logo that featured a stylized boot and ball. The current logo is a simple crest with a diagonal stripe, the MLS wordmark, and three stars that represent \"community, club, and country\". The logo was designed to be remixed in different color schemes that match teams when used on merchandise and jerseys.[268]  The first MLS anthem was unveiled in 2007 and was composed by Audiobrain. The current league anthem debuted in 2020 and was composed by film score composer Hans Zimmer. It will be used during league broadcasts and as a prelude to kickoff at stadiums.[269]  In the early years of MLS, teams were typically given official nicknames in the style of other U.S. sports leagues (e.g., Columbus Crew, Los Angeles Galaxy, New England Revolution). Several club names in MLS originated with previous professional soccer clubs, such as the 1970s-era NASL team names San Jose Earthquakes, Seattle Sounders, Portland Timbers, and Vancouver Whitecaps.[270]  D.C. United was the only MLS team to adopt European naming conventions during the 1990s.[271] In more recent years, European-style names have become increasingly common in MLS, with expansion teams such as Real Salt Lake, Toronto FC, New York City FC, Atlanta United FC, Minnesota United FC, and FC Cincinnati, along with rebrandings such as FC Dallas (formerly the Dallas Burn),[272] Sporting Kansas City (formerly the Kansas City Wizards),[273] and CF Montr\u00e9al (formerly the Montreal Impact).  Austrian beverage company Red Bull GmbH owns and sponsors the New York Red Bulls as well as other sports teams outside the U.S.[150]  Starting in 2023, all MLS and Leagues Cup matches, as well as certain matches from MLS Next Pro and MLS Next, are streamed worldwide on MLS Season Pass via Apple TV. This agreement ended the previous regional sports network-based system.[274] The contract allows for some broadcasts on linear television. ESPN and Univision exited negotiations, apparently because MLS would not allow them to stream via their own platforms or use their own commentators.[275][276] Following their departures, Fox Sports joined Apple as MLS's linear broadcast partners in the U.S., with Bell Media's TSN and RDS doing so in Canada.[277]  From 2012 to 2014, MLS matches were broadcast by NBC Sports, with 40 matches per year\u2014primarily on NBCSN, and select matches broadcast on the NBC network.[278] The move from Fox Soccer to the more widely distributed NBCSN caused viewership numbers to double for the 2012 season.[279]  Soccer United Marketing partnered with Google and Bedrocket Media Ventures in 2012 to launch \"KickTV\", a premium YouTube channel with original soccer programming.[280] KickTV was sold to Copa90 in 2015 to form its American branch.[281] In 2020, Soccer United Marketing signed a multi-year agreement with Bleacher Report to produce content and highlights for MLS and the U.S. national teams through the 2022 season.[282]  From 2015 to 2022, MLS matches were broadcast nationally by ESPN networks and Fox Sports in English, and Univision networks in Spanish under an eight-year contract. Each broadcaster had a window for national regular season matches, with UniM\u00e1s airing a game on Friday nights in Spanish and additional matches on Univision Deportes Network, and ESPN and Fox Sports 1 airing games on Sunday evenings in English. ESPN, FS1, and Univision shared coverage of the playoffs, while ABC and Fox alternated broadcasting the MLS Cup final in English. In total, at least 125 matches were aired per-season across all three networks. The three contracts have an average estimated value of $90 million per season\u2014five times larger than the average $18 million value of the previous contracts with ESPN, Univision, and NBC Sports.[283][284][285]  Matches not televised nationally were broadcast regionally, often by regional sports networks like Bally Sports, NBC Sports Regional Networks, Spectrum Sports and Root Sports, and sometimes by terrestrial stations like KTXA, WGN and KMYU.[89] Regionally televised matches were available outside their local markets on ESPN+, which replaced MLS Live from 2018 until 2022.[286]  Coverage of MLS expanded into Canada in 2007 with the addition of Toronto FC. Currently, English-language national MLS broadcast rights in Canada are held by the TSN networks through a five-year deal first renewed in 2017. The networks primarily broadcast matches involving the league's Canadian franchises, in combination with separate \"regional\" rights deals giving TSN exclusive rights to all Toronto FC and Vancouver Whitecaps FC matches.[287][288][289] A limited number of matches are also carried by CTV.[289]  TVA Sports holds exclusive French-language rights to MLS in Canada as of the 2017 season. As part of a separate \"regional\" rights deal, it also holds exclusive rights to all CF Montr\u00e9al games.[289][290]  In 2018, online streaming service DAZN obtained Major League Soccer's digital out-of-market service MLS Live with live and on-demand streaming of matches featuring U.S. teams (matches with Canadian teams are only available after a 48-hour delay to protect the league's main rightsholders TSN and TVA Sports).[291]  MLS also entered into a four-year contract with Sky Sports to broadcast two MLS matches per week in the United Kingdom and Ireland from 2015 to 2019.[292] As part of the agreement, Sky Sports broadcast at least two MLS regular-season matches each week, as well as the MLS All-Star Game, every MLS Cup Playoff game, and the MLS Cup final. The matches appeared across Sky's family of networks. It also carried weekly MLS highlights across various platforms, including Sky Sports News and SkySports.com. Sky Sports also broadcast at least one match from MLS's \"Decision Day\" \u2013 the final day of the MLS regular season. Many of the matches on Decision Day every year are expected to determine the final spots for the MLS Cup Playoffs.[293]  DSport, owned by Discovery Communications, will televise league matches in India beginning in 2017.[294]  Major League Soccer is a playable league in the EA Sports FC series, the eFootball series, and the Football Manager series. The league made its video game debut in 1999 with FIFA 2000. Kids video game company Humongous Entertainment had the rights to teams and players for their game, Backyard Soccer MLS Edition and for Backyard Soccer 2004. In 2000, Konami released ESPN MLS GameNight, and two years later, they released its sequel, ESPN MLS ExtraTime 2002. The league made its first appearance in the management series Football Manager 2005 in 2004.[295]  Statistics below are for all-time leaders. Statistics are for regular season only. Bold indicates active MLS players.      Statistics below are for all-time leaders who are still playing. Statistics are for regular season only.    At the conclusion of each season, the league presents several awards for outstanding achievements, mostly to players, but also to coaches, referees, and teams. The finalists in each category are determined by voting from MLS players, team employees, and the media.[297]   "},{"title":"Offense (sports)","content":"  In sports, offense (American spelling) or offence (Commonwealth spelling, see spelling differences; pronounced with first-syllable stress; from Latin offensus), known as attack outside of North America, is the action of attacking or engaging an opposing team with the objective of scoring points or goals. The term may refer to the tactics involved in offense, or a sub-team whose primary responsibility is offense.  Generally, goals are scored by teams' offenses, but in sports such as American football it is common to see defenses and special teams (which serve as a team's offensive unit on kicking plays and defensive on returning plays) score as well. The fielding side in cricket is also generally known as the bowling attack despite the batting side being the side that scores runs, because they can prevent batting players from scoring by getting them out, and end the batting team's scoring turn by getting them all out.  In countries outside North America, the term offence is almost always taken to mean an infraction of the rules, a penalty or foul, and attack is more likely to be used where Americans would use offense.  Many sports involve elements of offense and defense, where teams take turns trying to score points while also trying to prevent the opposing team from scoring. Sports that use an offense and defense:  Baseball's offense revolves around the team trying to get on base and score runs against the opposing team. Each team has nine chances to score runs, with a total of once per inning.[1]  During an at-bat, the batter attempts to reach base by contacting the baseball with the baseball bat and putting it in fair territory without the defense making a play to get them out.[3] Hits are classified in four separate ways:   Once a batter reaches base, they becomes a baserunner. Baserunners can advance to the next base on subsequent hits, walks (when the pitcher throws four balls outside the strike zone), or when they steal a base (attempt to advance while the pitcher is delivering the ball). Baserunners must touch each base in order, and they can be tagged out by defenders with the ball.  The batting team's objective is to score runs. A run is scored when a baserunner successfully advances around all four bases and touches home plate before the defensive team can record three outs.[9]  The batting team has three outs per inning to try to score runs. An out can occur in various ways, including striking out (when the batter fails to hit the ball after three strikes), getting caught by a fielder, or by force outs (when a fielder with possession of the ball reaches a base before the baserunner).  Offense in baseball also involves strategic decisions by the batters and coaches. This includes bunting (purposefully tapping the ball lightly to advance baserunners), stealing bases, hitting for power, and executing hit-and-run plays.  In football, the offense is the team with the ball and trying to score points. At the start of the game, the offense gets the ball first. The main goal of the offense is to move the ball down the field toward the opponent's end zone. This is done by running with the ball or throwing it to the offensive teammates. The offense has four chances (called downs) to move the ball at least 10 yards. If the offense succeed, they get another set of downs. If the offense does not, the other team will get the ball. The offense uses different strategies and plays to outsmart the defense and move the ball efficiently and effectively. The coaches design these plays and involve players running specific routes, blocking opponents, and making quick decisions with the ball.[10]  The ultimate aim of the offense is to score points. They can do this by carrying the ball into the opponent's end zone for a touchdown (worth 6 points) or by kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal (worth 3 points). If they score a touchdown, they can also score an extra point by kicking the ball through the goalposts (1 point) or running or passing the ball into the end zone (2-point conversions).[11]  The offense's job is to advance the ball down the field and score points while avoiding turnovers and getting stopped by the defense.

Each team consists of one goalkeeper (who wears a different colour jersey), six backs, two midfielders, and six forwards: 15 players in all. Some under-age games are played 13-a-side (in which case the full-back and full-forward positions are removed) or 11-a-side (in which case the full-back, centre back, centre forward and full-forward positions are removed).[1]  The positions are listed below, with the jersey number usually worn by players in that position given.  The role of a goalkeeper, who wears the number 1 jersey in Gaelic games, is similar to other codes: to prevent the ball from entering the goal. The goalkeeper in Gaelic football and hurling also usually has the role of kicking or pucking the ball out to the outfield players. A good goalkeeper most often has great agility and bravery as well as strength and height. In Gaelic football a keeper's shot stopping ability is of great importance alongside blocking. There is no limit to where on the field the goalkeeper can travel, although once they are outside the penalty area, they are subject to the same rules as all other players. A goalkeeper in men's football may touch the ball on the ground within his own small parallelogram, and is the only player permitted to do so.It is not permitted to physically challenge a goalkeeper while inside his own small parallelogram, but players may harass him into playing a bad pass, or block an attempted pass. The substitute goalkeeper usually wears the number 16 jersey and the third choice goalkeeper usually wears the number 31.  The role of the right and left corner-back who, respectively, wear the number 2 and number 4 jerseys, is to defend against opposing attackers \u2013 in particular the left and right corner-forwards. They will play most around the 20-metre line. The positions require the players having decent speed over short bursts and good hand eye co-ordination, and agility is required.  The role of full-back who wears the number 3 jersey is one of the most important in Gaelic football or hurling. As well as defending against attackers, the full-back is responsible for organising the defence and is the key defender in front of goals, and is usually one of the tallest and strongest players on the team. The full back plays most often around the 20-metre line. The position of the full-back requires that the player have decent speed over short bursts, strength, and good hand eye co-ordination. In playing either corner-back or full-back positions a well-developed aerobic system is required although, unlike the corner-backs, the full-back is needed to make short burst sprints both away from and into the goal area.  The role of the half backs who wear the 5 (right) and 7 (left) jerseys is less defensive than that of the corner-backs. The half-backs operate most often in between the 45-metre line and the midfield. The half-backs are expected to defend against the opposition's half-forward line but also has a responsibility to make runs from the 45-metre line to advance the play to the half-forward and full-forward lines.  Sometimes referred to as right\/left wing-back.  The role of the centre half-back who wears the number 6 jersey, is less defensive than that of the full-back. The centre backs operates from the 45-metre line and forward to the midfield. The centre back will help win the breaking ball in the midfield and can be used as a third midfielder. The centre half-back generally marks the centre half-forward. Sometimes referred to as centre back. The required agilities of a centre half-back are strength, height, speed and a good catching game.  The role of the midfield who wears the number 8 or 9 jersey is to catch kick outs \/ puck outs from either team's goalkeeper, and to act as the main link between the defending and attacking sections of the team. Midfield is often described as the most important role on the pitch. If the opposing goalkeeper is kicking the ball to the middle of the field, the midfielder has the responsibility to retrieve the ball and therefore prevent the opposing team from taking advantage and bringing the ball forward. This then gives a new responsibility to the midfielder to get the ball moving forward to the half forward and full forward lines.  The position requires the player to have strength, height, speed, good catching ability, a good kicking game and, most importantly, endurance. It is important for the midfield to have a good understanding of their goalkeeper. They must anticipate where their goalkeeper will place the ball and therefore take advantage and bring the ball forward. Note that there is rarely a \"left midfielder\" and \"right midfielder\" \u2013 both play 'off' each other as a combined unit.  If one midfielder is attacking, the other always goes up the field with him in support. Both midfielders always attack or defend at the same time.  The role of the right and left wing-forward who wear, respectively, numbers 10 and number 12 jerseys, is to build up attacks and to feed the ball to the full-forward line and also taking shots on goal or above the bar when opportunities present themselves. The wing-forwards will cover much ground and utilising speedy wing-forwards to run at defences is a common tactic. They operate from the midfield to the opposition's 45 metre line. The right wing-forward's main opposing player is the left wing-back and vice versa.  Sometimes referred to as right\/left half forward.  The role of the centre -forward who wears the number 11 jersey, is to build up attacks and feed the ball to the full-forward line. The centre -forward is responsible for taking shots on goal and points when opportunities present themselves. The centre forward will cover much ground and utilising speedy half forwards to run at defences is a common tactic. The centre forward also helps win breaking ball in the midfield, helping to win the possession to bring the ball forward. The centre forward operates from the midfield to the opposition's 45-metre line.  Sometimes referred to as half forward.  The role of the left and right corner-forwards, who wear the number 15 and 13 jerseys respectively, is to watch the full-forward's breaks and to score points and goals. The full-forward line operates around the opposition's 21-metre line. The corner-forwards are generally marked by the corner-backs.  The role of the full-forward who wears the number 14 jersey is to score goals in particular although points are usually the outcome of their attempts on goal. The full-forward line operates around the opposition's 21-metre line. The full-forward is generally marked by the full back.  It is common for teams to employ a tall full-forward to pluck high balls from the sky and to challenge the size and strength of the full-back.  Substitutes wear jersey numbers 16 upwards (usually up to 31). 16 is usually worn by the substitute goalkeeper, and the third choice goalkeeper usually wears the number 31 jersey. "},{"title":"Metaphor","content":"  A metaphor is a figure of speech that, for rhetorical effect, directly refers to one thing by mentioning another.[1] It may provide (or obscure) clarity or identify hidden similarities between two different ideas. Metaphors are usually meant to create a likeness or an analogy.[2]  Metaphors are often compared with other types of figurative language, such as antithesis, hyperbole, metonymy, and simile.[3] One of the most commonly cited examples of a metaphor in English literature comes from the \"All the world's a stage\" monologue from As You Like It:  All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players; They have their exits and their entrances  And one man in his time plays many parts, His Acts being seven ages. At first, the infant... \u2014William Shakespeare, As You Like It, 2\/7[4]  This quotation expresses a metaphor because the world is not literally a stage, and most humans are not literally actors and actresses playing roles. By asserting that the world is a stage, Shakespeare uses points of comparison between the world and a stage to convey an understanding about the mechanics of the world and the behavior of the people within it.  In the ancient Hebrew psalms (around 1000 B.C.), one finds already vivid and poetic examples of metaphor such as, \"The Lord is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer; my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold\" and \"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want\". Some recent linguistic theories view all language in essence as metaphorical.[5]  The word\u00a0metaphor itself is a metaphor, coming from a Greek term meaning 'transference (of ownership)'. The user of a metaphor alters the reference of the word, \"carrying\" it from one semantic \"realm\" to another. The new meaning of the word might be derived from an analogy between the two semantic realms, but also from other reasons such as the distortion of the semantic realm - for example in sarcasm.  The English word metaphor derives from the 16th-century Old French word m\u00e9taphore, which comes from the Latin metaphora, 'carrying over', and in turn from the Greek \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03ac (metaphor\u00e1), 'transference (of ownership)',[6] from \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9 (metapher\u014d), 'to carry over, to transfer'[7] and that from \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac (meta), 'behind, along with, across'[8] + \u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9 (pher\u014d), 'to bear, to carry'.[9]  The Philosophy of Rhetoric (1936) by rhetorician I. A. Richards describes a metaphor as having two parts: the tenor and the vehicle. The tenor is the subject to which attributes are ascribed. The vehicle is the object whose attributes are borrowed. In the previous example, \"the world\" is compared to a stage, describing it with the attributes of \"the stage\"; \"the world\" is the tenor, and \"a stage\" is the vehicle; \"men and women\" is the secondary tenor, and \"players\" is the secondary vehicle.  Other writers[which?] employ the general terms ground and figure to denote the tenor and the vehicle. Cognitive linguistics uses the terms target and source, respectively.  Psychologist Julian Jaynes coined the terms metaphrand and metaphier, plus two new concepts, paraphrand and paraphier.[10][11] Metaphrand is equivalent to the metaphor-theory terms tenor, target, and ground. Metaphier is equivalent to the metaphor-theory terms vehicle, figure, and source. In a simple metaphor, an obvious attribute of the metaphier exactly characterizes the metaphrand (e.g. \"the ship plowed the seas\"). With an inexact metaphor, however, a metaphier might have associated attributes or nuances \u2013 its paraphiers \u2013 that enrich the metaphor because they \"project back\" to the metaphrand, potentially creating new ideas \u2013 the paraphrands \u2013 associated thereafter with the metaphrand or even leading to a new metaphor. For example, in the metaphor \"Pat is a tornado\", the metaphrand is Pat; the metaphier is tornado. As metaphier, tornado carries paraphiers such as power, storm and wind, counterclockwise motion, and danger, threat, destruction, etc. The metaphoric meaning of tornado is inexact: one might understand that 'Pat is powerfully destructive' through the paraphrand of physical and emotional destruction; another person might understand the metaphor as 'Pat can spin out of control'. In the latter case, the paraphier of 'spinning motion' has become the paraphrand 'psychological spin', suggesting an entirely new metaphor for emotional unpredictability, a possibly apt description for a human being hardly applicable to a tornado. Based on his analysis, Jaynes claims that metaphors not only enhance description, but \"increase enormously our powers of perception...and our understanding of [the world], and literally create new objects\".[10]:\u200a50\u200a  Metaphors are most frequently compared with similes.  A metaphor asserts the objects in the comparison are identical on the point of comparison, while a simile merely asserts a similarity through use of words such as like or as. For this reason a common-type metaphor is generally considered more forceful than a simile.[13][14]  The metaphor category contains these specialized types:  It is said that a metaphor is 'a condensed analogy' or 'analogical fusion' or that they 'operate in a similar fashion' or are 'based on the same mental process' or yet that 'the basic processes of analogy are at work in metaphor'. It is also pointed out that 'a border between metaphor and analogy is fuzzy'  and 'the difference between them might be described (metaphorically) as the distance between things being compared'.[This quote needs a citation]  Metaphor is distinct from metonymy, the two terms exhibit different fundamental modes of thought. Metaphor works by bringing together concepts from different conceptual domains, whereas metonymy uses one element from a given domain to refer to another closely related element. A metaphor creates new links between otherwise distinct conceptual domains, whereas a metonymy relies on pre-existent links within such domains.  For example, in the phrase \"lands belonging to the crown\", the word crown is a metonymy because some monarchs do indeed wear a crown, physically. In other words, there is a pre-existent link between crown and monarchy.[18] On the other hand, when Ghil'ad Zuckermann argues that the Israeli language is a \"phoenicuckoo cross with some magpie characteristics\", he is using metaphor.[19]:\u200a4\u200a There is no physical link between a language and a bird. The reason the metaphors phoenix and cuckoo are used is that on the one hand hybridic Israeli is based on Hebrew, which, like a phoenix, rises from the ashes; and on the other hand, hybridic Israeli is based on Yiddish, which like a cuckoo, lays its egg in the nest of another bird, tricking it to believe that it is its own egg. Furthermore, the metaphor magpie is employed because, according to Zuckermann, hybridic Israeli displays the characteristics of a magpie, \"stealing\" from languages such as Arabic and English.[19]:\u200a4\u20136\u200a  A dead metaphor is a metaphor in which the sense of a transferred image has become absent. The phrases \"to grasp a concept\" and \"to gather what you've understood\" use physical action as a metaphor for understanding. The audience does not need to visualize the action; dead metaphors normally go unnoticed. Some distinguish between a dead metaphor and a clich\u00e9. Others use \"dead metaphor\" to denote both.[20]  A mixed metaphor is a metaphor that leaps from one identification to a second inconsistent with the first, e.g.:  I smell a rat [...] but I'll nip him in the bud\" \u2014 Irish politician Boyle Roche This form is often used as a parody of metaphor itself:  If we can hit that bull's-eye then the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards... Checkmate. An extended metaphor, or conceit, sets up a principal subject with several subsidiary subjects or comparisons. In the above quote from As You Like It, the world is first described as a stage and then the subsidiary subjects men and women are further described in the same context.  An implicit metaphor has no specified tenor, although the vehicle is present. M. H. Abrams offers the following as an example of an implicit metaphor: \"That reed was too frail to survive the storm of its sorrows\". The reed is the vehicle for the implicit tenor, someone's death, and the storm is the vehicle for the person's sorrows.[22]  Metaphor can serve as a device for persuading an audience of the user's argument or thesis, the so-called rhetorical metaphor.  Aristotle writes in his work the Rhetoric that metaphors make learning pleasant: \"To learn easily is naturally pleasant to all people, and words signify something, so whatever words create knowledge in us are the pleasantest.\"[23] When discussing Aristotle's Rhetoric, Jan Garret stated \"metaphor most brings about learning; for when [Homer] calls old age \"stubble\", he creates understanding and knowledge through the genus, since both old age and stubble are [species of the genus of] things that have lost their bloom.\"[24] Metaphors, according to Aristotle, have \"qualities of the exotic and the fascinating; but at the same time we recognize that strangers do not have the same rights as our fellow citizens\".[25]  Educational psychologist Andrew Ortony gives more explicit detail: \"Metaphors are necessary as a communicative device because they allow the transfer of coherent chunks of characteristics -- perceptual, cognitive, emotional and experiential \u2013 from a vehicle which is known to a topic which is less so. In so doing they circumvent the problem of specifying one by one each of the often unnameable and innumerable characteristics; they avoid discretizing the perceived continuity of experience and are thus closer to experience and consequently more vivid and memorable.\"[26]  As a characteristic of speech and writing, metaphors can serve the poetic imagination. This allows Sylvia Plath, in her poem \"Cut\", to compare the blood issuing from her cut thumb to the running of a million soldiers, \"redcoats, every one\"; and enabling Robert Frost, in \"The Road Not Taken\", to compare a life to a journey.[27][28][29]  Metaphors can be implied and extended throughout pieces of literature.  Sonja K. Foss characterizes metaphors as \"nonliteral comparisons in which a word or phrase from one domain of experience is applied to another domain\".[30] She argues that since reality is mediated by the language we use to describe it, the metaphors we use shape the world and our interactions to it.  The term metaphor is used to describe more basic or general aspects of experience and cognition:  Some theorists have suggested that metaphors are not merely stylistic, but that they are cognitively important as well. In Metaphors We Live By, George Lakoff and Mark Johnson argue that metaphors are pervasive in everyday life, not just in language, but also in thought and action. A common definition of metaphor can be described as a comparison that shows how two things that are not alike in most ways are similar in another important way. They explain how a metaphor is simply understanding and experiencing one kind of thing in terms of another, called a \"conduit metaphor\". A speaker can put ideas or objects into containers, and then send them along a conduit to a listener who removes the object from the container to make meaning of it. Thus, communication is something that ideas go into, and the container is separate from the ideas themselves. Lakoff and Johnson give several examples of daily metaphors in use, including \"argument is war\" and \"time is money\". Metaphors are widely used in context to describe personal meaning. The authors suggest that communication can be viewed as a machine: \"Communication is not what one does with the machine, but is the machine itself.\"[31]  Experimental evidence shows that \"priming\" people with material from one area will influence how they perform tasks and interpret language in a metaphorically related area.[note 1]  Cognitive linguists emphasize that metaphors serve to facilitate the understanding of one conceptual domain\u2014typically an abstraction such as \"life\", \"theories\" or \"ideas\"\u2014through expressions that relate to another, more familiar conceptual domain\u2014typically more concrete, such as \"journey\", \"buildings\" or \"food\".[33][34] For example: one devours a book of raw facts, tries to digest them, stews over them, lets them simmer on the back-burner, regurgitates them in discussions, and cooks up explanations, hoping they do not seem half-baked.  A convenient short-hand way of capturing this view of metaphor is the following: CONCEPTUAL DOMAIN (A) IS CONCEPTUAL DOMAIN (B), which is what is called a conceptual metaphor. A conceptual metaphor consists of two conceptual domains, in which one domain is understood in terms of another. A conceptual domain is any coherent organization of experience. For example, we have coherently organized knowledge about journeys that we rely on in understanding life.[34] Lakoff and Johnson greatly contributed to establishing the importance of conceptual metaphor as a framework for thinking in language, leading scholars to investigate the original ways in which writers used novel metaphors and question the fundamental frameworks of thinking in conceptual metaphors.  From a sociological, cultural, or philosophical perspective, one asks to what extent ideologies maintain and impose conceptual patterns of thought by introducing, supporting, and adapting fundamental patterns of thinking metaphorically.[35] To what extent does the ideology fashion and refashion the idea of the nation as a container with borders? How are enemies and outsiders represented? As diseases? As attackers? How are the metaphoric paths of fate, destiny, history, and progress represented? As the opening of an eternal monumental moment (German fascism)? Or as the path to communism (in Russian or Czech for example)?[citation needed]  Some cognitive scholars have attempted to take on board the idea that different languages have evolved radically different concepts and conceptual metaphors, while others hold to the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. German philologist Wilhelm von Humboldt contributed significantly to this debate on the relationship between culture, language, and linguistic communities. Humboldt remains, however, relatively unknown in English-speaking nations. Andrew Goatly, in \"Washing the Brain\", takes on board the dual problem of conceptual metaphor as a framework implicit in the language as a system and the way individuals and ideologies negotiate conceptual metaphors. Neural biological research suggests some metaphors are innate, as demonstrated by reduced metaphorical understanding in psychopathy.[36]  James W. Underhill, in Creating Worldviews: Ideology, Metaphor & Language (Edinburgh UP), considers the way individual speech adopts and reinforces certain metaphoric paradigms. This involves a critique of both communist and fascist discourse. Underhill's studies are situated in Czech and German, which allows him to demonstrate the ways individuals are thinking both within and resisting the modes by which ideologies seek to appropriate key concepts such as \"the people\", \"the state\", \"history\", and \"struggle\".  Though metaphors can be considered to be \"in\" language, Underhill's chapter on French, English and ethnolinguistics demonstrates that language or languages cannot be conceived of in anything other than metaphoric terms.  Several other philosophers have embraced the view that metaphors may also be described as examples of a linguistic \"category mistake\" which have the potential of leading unsuspecting users into considerable obfuscation of thought within the realm of epistemology. Included among them is the Australian philosopher Colin Murray Turbayne.[37] In his book \"The Myth of Metaphor\", Turbayne argues that the use of metaphor is an essential component within the context of any language system which claims to embody richness and depth of understanding.[38] In addition, he clarifies the limitations associated with a literal interpretation of the mechanistic Cartesian and Newtonian depictions of the universe as little more than a \"machine\" \u2013 a concept which continues to underlie much of the scientific materialism which prevails in the modern Western world.[39] He argues further that the philosophical concept of \"substance\" or \"substratum\" has limited meaning at best and that physicalist theories of the universe depend upon mechanistic metaphors which are drawn from deductive logic in the development of their hypotheses.[40][41][39] By interpreting such metaphors literally, Turbayne argues that modern man has unknowingly fallen victim to only one of several metaphorical models of the universe which may be more beneficial in nature.[42][39]  Metaphors can map experience between two nonlinguistic realms. Musicologist Leonard B. Meyer demonstrated how purely rhythmic and harmonic events can express human emotions.[43] It is an open question whether synesthesia experiences are a sensory version of metaphor, the \"source\" domain being the presented stimulus, such as a musical tone, and the target domain, being the experience in another modality, such as color.[44]  Art theorist Robert Vischer argued that when we look at a painting, we \"feel ourselves into it\" by imagining our body in the posture of a nonhuman or inanimate object in the painting. For example, the painting The Lonely Tree by Caspar David Friedrich shows a tree with contorted, barren limbs.[45][46] Looking at the painting, we imagine our limbs in a similarly contorted and barren shape, evoking a feeling of strain and distress. Nonlinguistic metaphors may be the foundation of our experience of visual and musical art, as well as dance and other art forms.[47][48]  In historical onomasiology or in historical linguistics, a metaphor is defined as a semantic change based on a similarity in form or function between the original concept and the target concept named by a word.[49]  For example, mouse: small, gray rodent with a long tail \u2192 small, gray computer device with a long cord.  Some recent linguistic theories hold that language evolved from the capability of the brain to create metaphors that link actions and sensations to sounds.[50]  Aristotle discusses the creation of metaphors at the end of his Poetics: \"But the greatest thing by far is to be a master of metaphor. It is the one thing that cannot be learnt from others; and it is also a sign of genius, since a good metaphor implies an intuitive perception of the similarity in dissimilars.\"[51]  Baroque literary theorist Emanuele Tesauro defines the metaphor \"the most witty and acute, the most strange and marvelous, the most pleasant and useful, the most eloquent and fecund part of the human intellect\". There is, he suggests, something divine in metaphor: the world itself is God's poem[52] and metaphor is not just a literary or rhetorical figure but an analytic tool that can penetrate the mysteries of God and His creation.[53]  Friedrich Nietzsche makes metaphor the conceptual center of his early theory of society in On Truth and Lies in the Non-Moral Sense.[54] Some sociologists have found his essay useful for thinking about metaphors used in society and for reflecting on their own use of metaphor. Sociologists of religion note the importance of metaphor in religious worldviews, and that it is impossible to think sociologically about religion without metaphor.[55] "},{"title":"Rugby league playing field","content":"  The rugby league playing field,[1] also referred to as a pitch[2] or paddock, is the playing surface for the sport of rugby league football and is surfaced exclusively with grass.[3]  The dimensions and markings of a full-sized playing area are defined in Section 1 of the Laws of the Game.[1] These Laws are the agreed upon and maintained by the Rugby League International Federation. The playing field is defined as \"the area bounded by, but not including, the touch lines and dead ball lines\" by Section 2.[4] If the ball or any player in possession of it makes contact with the touch lines or dead ball lines or the ground beyond them it is deemed to be out of play.  The rugby league field also has markings to denote where restarts, such as scrums, should be placed.[5]  A rugby league pitch (or field) is 68\u00a0m (74 yards) wide and 112\u2013122\u00a0m (122\u2013133 yards) long. The try lines (or goal lines) stand 100\u00a0m (110 yards) apart. On each one is a goal post that is 5.5\u00a0m (6 yards) wide and at least 16\u00a0m (17 yards) high, with a crossbar set 3\u00a0m (3.3 yards) above the ground. The distance from try line to dead-ball line is 6\u201311\u00a0m (7\u201312 yards).[6]  The field of play is a fixed size \u2013 100\u00a0m (110 yards) long and 68\u00a0m (74 yards) wide and does not include the line markings, meaning all touchlines and dead ball lines are considered out of play.[6]  Near each end of the field is a goal line,[1] or try-line; they are 100\u00a0m (110 yards) apart.[1] A scoring area called the in-goal area extends 6\u201311\u00a0m (7\u201312 yards) from each try-line to each dead ball line.[1]  Most play will occur within the field of play, this \"is the area bounded by, but not including, the touch lines and goal lines\".[7]  When the team in possession of the ball is attempting to score a try, the goal line is included in the in-goal area, grounding the ball correctly on either is a try.[8]  When the team in possession is attempting to return the ball to the field of play from their own in-goal area the goal line is part of the field of play. A team caught with the ball in their own in-goal must restart play with a drop kick of the ball from between their posts, this usually results in the other team gaining possession.  Between the goal lines, broken lines run parallel to each touch line at 10 and 20\u00a0m (11 and 22 yards) from touch.[1] Free kicks are taken 10\u00a0m (11 yards) in from the point where the ball entered touch after being kicked out to gain ground from a penalty.[7] If a scrum is required to restart play and the event that caused it occurred \"within 20 metres of a touch line or ten metres of a goal line the scrum shall be brought in twenty metres from the touch line and ten metres from the goal line\".[9]  Lines with distance markers transverse the field every 10\u00a0m (11 yards) perpendicular to the touch lines.[1] The distances ascend from each goal line towards the halfway line, which is marked \"50\" (similar to a typical American football field).[1][10] These lines, as well as the goal lines, dead ball lines and touch lines are 15\u00a0cm (6 inches) wide and white in colour,[10] the only exception being the 40-metre (44-yard) lines, which are usually coloured red to distinguish them for the determination of 40\u201320 kicks in play.  The broken lines 10 metres (11 yards) and 20 metres (22 yards) in from the touch lines are 10\u00a0cm (4 inches) wide and white in colour.[10]  The distance markers on the playing field are white with a red outline.[10] These numbers are 2\u00a0m (6.6 feet).[10]  On each goal line are two goal posts 5.5\u00a0m (18 feet) apart connected by a cross bar 3\u00a0m (9.8 feet) from the ground.[1] Each goal post is 16\u00a0m (52 feet) in height (however they can be built higher)[1] and for the purpose of judging a goal are considered to extend upwards indefinitely.[11] The posts and crossbar form an \"H\" shape. Goal posts supported by only one post below the crossbar are permissible.[11] The bottom 2\u00a0m (6.6 feet) of a goal post is recommended to be padded to protect players from injury.[10] At professional level, these pads are usually cuboids that encase each post.  A corner post is placed at the points where each touch line meets each goal line.[12] The post must consist of non-rigid material and should be at least 1.3\u00a0m (4.3 feet) in height.[6] The corner posts are in touch in-goal,[12] that is to say they act in the same way as sidelines and the ball-carrier touching them immediately halts play.  During the 2010 NRL season, a rule change to the playing field was implemented so that if a player in possession of the ball made contact with the corner post that player would no longer be considered to be touch in-goal.[13] Proponents of the move argued a series a possible future scenarios made this preventative measure necessary, with ARL chief executive Geoff Carr stating, \"no one has thought of the possibility of using the corner post as a weapon to defuse a try and we want to stop it before they do\".[14] One scenario was that a defending player might manipulate the corner post to put an attacker out of play.[14] Another concern cited was that the corner post might be made to make contact with a rolling ball to ensure the defending team gains possession with a 20-metre restart.[14] Corner posts, which sometimes lean to one side, have no upper height limit set and this led to a fear that corner posts might become \"long rubber snakes, biting attackers and sending them into touch\", in the words of Roy Masters.[14] Other laws concerning the corner posts remained unchanged.[15] A ball that makes contact with the corner post while not in the possession of a player will be deemed to be touch in-goal as before.[15] There was no attempt to remove the corner posts from the playing field as they are used to promote sponsors and are also a useful aid for players to judge their kicks.[14] The change was agreed by the NRL Board and approved by the RLIF as an experimental rule.[13] Implementation occurred mid-season following feedback from clubs.[13] "},{"title":"World Rugby","content":"  World Rugby is the governing body for the sport of rugby union.[1] World Rugby organises the Rugby World Cup every four years, the sport's most recognised and most profitable competition.[2] It also organises a number of other international competitions, such as the World Rugby Sevens Series, the Rugby World Cup Sevens, the World Under 20 Championship, and the Pacific Nations Cup.  World Rugby's headquarters are in Dublin, Ireland.[3][4] Its membership now comprises 120 national unions.[5] Each member country must also be a member of one of the six regional unions into which the world is divided: Africa, North America, Asia, Europe, South America, and Oceania.[6]  World Rugby was founded as the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) in 1886 by Scotland, Wales and Ireland, with England joining in 1890.[7] Australia, New Zealand and South Africa became full members in 1949.[7] France became a member in 1978 and a further 80 members joined from 1987 to 1999.[7] The body was renamed the International Rugby Board (IRB) in 1998, and took up its current name of World Rugby in November 2014.[8] In 2009, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted to include rugby sevens in the 2016 Summer Olympics.[9] World Rugby gained membership of the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF) in 2010.[10]  Until 1885 the laws of rugby football were made by England as the founder nation. However, following a disputed try in an international between Scotland and England in 1884, letters were exchanged in which England claimed that they made the laws, and the try should stand.[11] Scotland refused to play England in the 1885 Home Nations Championship. Following the dispute, the home unions of Scotland, Ireland and Wales decided to form an international union whose membership would agree on the standard rules of rugby football. The three nations met in Dublin in 1886, though no formal regulations were agreed upon.   On 5 December 1887, committee members of the Irish Rugby Football Union, Scottish Rugby Union (named the Scottish Football Union at the time) and Welsh Rugby Union met in Manchester and wrote up the first four principles of the International Rugby Football Board. England refused to take part in the founding of the IRFB, stating that they should have greater representation, as they had more clubs.[12] The England Union also refused to accept the IRFB as the recognised lawmaker of the game.[12] This led to the IRFB taking the stance of member countries not playing England until they joined, and no games were played against England in 1888 and 1889.[13] In 1890 England joined the IRFB, gaining six seats while the other unions had two each.[13] The same year, the IRFB wrote the first international laws of rugby union.[14]  In 1893, the IRFB was faced with the divide between amateurism and professionalism, which was nicknamed the \"Great Schism\". Following the introduction of working-class men to the game in Northern England, clubs began paying \"broken time\" payments to players, due to the loss of earnings from playing on a Saturday.[15] Cumberland County Union also complained of another club using monetary incentives to lure players, leading to the IRFB conducting an enquiry. The IRFB was warned by all the chief clubs in Lancashire and Yorkshire that any punishment would lead to the clubs seceding from the union.[15] The debate over broken time payments ultimately caused the 22 leading clubs in Yorkshire and Lancashire to form the Northern Rugby Football Union. The competing unions' laws of the game diverged almost immediately; the northern body's code eventually became known as rugby league football.[15]  England's seats on the IRFB were reduced from six to four in 1911. The Australian Rugby Union, New Zealand Rugby Football Union and South African Rugby Board joined the board with one seat each in 1948, with England's seats being reduced to two, the same as the other home nations. The three Southern Hemisphere unions were given a second seat each in 1958.[16] The French Rugby Federation was admitted in 1978, the Argentine Rugby Union, Italian Rugby Federation and  USA Rugby Football Union in 1987, and the Canadian Rugby Union, and Japan Rugby Football Union were admitted in 1991.[13] In 2016, the Georgia Rugby Union, Romanian Rugby Federation, and the USA were added to the voting Council with one vote each. Additionally, current Council members Argentina, Canada and Italy were granted a second representative and vote. The six regional associations represented on the council also received an additional vote.[17]  After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, World Rugby suspended Russia from international and European continental rugby union competition. In addition, the Rugby Union of Russia was suspended from World Rugby.[18][19]  In the 1960s Australians Harold Tolhurst and Jock Kellaher suggested a World Rugby Championship be held in Australia but the IRFB refused.[20] In 1983 and 1984 respectively, the Australian and New Zealand Rugby Football Unions each proposed hosting such a tournament.[21] The following year the board committed to conduct a feasibility study. A year later another meeting took place in Paris, and the Union subsequently voted on the idea. The South African Rugby Board's vote that proved crucial in setting up a tied vote, as they voted in favour, even though they knew they would be excluded due to the sporting boycott because of their apartheid policies. English and Welsh votes then changed, and the vote was won 10 to 6.[21]  As at November 2022, World Rugby has 108 member unions and 21 associate member unions.[22]  Membership of World Rugby is a four-step process:[23]  Regional Unions  Six regional associations, which represent each continent, are affiliated with World Rugby and help to develop the fifteen-a-side game as well as Rugby sevens across the world. Not all members of the regional associations are members of World Rugby. Below is a list of member and associate unions and their regional associations with the year that they joined World Rugby. Associate unions are in italics.  There are 21 World Rugby members and 6 World Rugby associates:  Suspended unions:  Notes:  \u00a0* Denotes associate membership date.

There are 11 World Rugby members:  World Rugby's largest members, ranked by number of participants in 2019, are:[32]  The World Rugby Council meets twice a year and manages and controls the affairs of World Rugby.[33] The Council formulates and oversees the implementation of World Rugby's strategic plan and application of policy decisions, and selects the host nation(s) for the Rugby World Cup. The Council considers recommendations of the General Assembly. The Council may admit or expel member nations. The council is also the supreme legislative authority of World Rugby. Most Council decisions require approval of simple majority, but to amend the World Rugby's by-laws, regulations, or the Laws of the Game requires approval of three quarters of the council.  Prior to 2016, the council had 28 voting members from 12 national unions. In November 2015, World Rugby announced that they would add more unions to the voting council and give the six regional associations two votes each on the council.[34][17]  As of October\u00a02023[update], the council had 52 members including the non-voting chairman, so there were 51 voting members from 17 national unions and 6 regional associations, allocated as follows:[35][36]  In total, Europe has 22 votes; Oceania 9 votes; South America 6 votes; Africa 5 votes; Asia 5 votes and North America 4 votes.  A Chairman and Vice Chairman are elected from among the council members.[37] These positions are held by Bill Beaumont of England and Bernard Laporte of France, respectively, elected as of April\u00a02020[update].[38][39]  The executive committee, in accordance with bye-laws 9.14\u20139.16, ensures the effective management and operation of the World Rugby.[40] The Committee formulates and monitors the implementation of the World Rugby's strategic plan, business plan, operational plan and budget.  In 2016, as part of the reforms to the World Rugby Council, the executive committee was increased to 12 members. The Chairman, Vice-chairman, nine elected officials, including two independent members, and the Chief Executive sit on the World Rugby Executive Committee.[41]  A General Assembly of the full membership is convened every two years.[4] The General Assembly may make recommendations to the council, and may consider business that the council has referred to it,[42] but the General Assembly has no legislative powers.[43]  The Chairman and vice-chairman of the World Rugby are elected by the council. The current chairman is Bill Beaumont, previously president of the Rugby Football Union (RFU). He was elected chairman effective on 1 July 2016 following the Executive Council vote on 11 May 2016.  Previous chairmen include Bernard Lapasset (2008 to 2016), Syd Millar (2002 to 2007) and Vernon Pugh, QC (1994 to 2002).  In July 2012, Brett Gosper was appointed as the new Chief Executive of what was then the IRB.[44] He will leave this role at the end of 2020 to become head of the National Football League's operations in Europe.[45]  In 2013 World Rugby released \u00a318.6\u00a0million of funding over three years for developing rugby in Canada, the United States, Japan, Romania, Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga. Argentina also received additional support to enable it to retain its tier one status. The money, built up from successful World Cups, was released following a report commissioned by World Rugby highlighting the growing disparity between tier one and tier two nations.[46] This is in addition to the \u00a310\u201312\u00a0million it normally gives out grants and tournament costs. The emphasis is on three areas infrastructure, high performance units and cross border competitions. In April 2006, tier-3 rugby nations Georgia, Portugal, Tunisia and Russia were identified as key investment nations over the next three years. The program was designed to increase the competitiveness of international rugby union.  World Rugby organises the Rugby World Cup, the sport's most recognised and most profitable competition, which has been held every four years since 1987.[2] Despite the profitability of the World Cup, the majority of its revenues and viewers come from a small number of countries. For the 2007 Rugby World Cup final, 87% of viewers came from England, France, Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, 15% came from the South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, with just 2% of viewers coming from all other countries.[43]  The most recent Rugby World Cup was held in France in 2023. South Africa defeated New Zealand 12\u201311 in the Rugby World Cup final, winning a record fourth title.  World Rugby also organises the women's Rugby World Cup, also held every four years. It was first held by the IRB in 1998, though tournaments in 1991 and 1994 were retrospectively recognised in 2009. The women's World Cup is contested by fewer teams than the men's Cup, with only the 1998 and 2002 editions featuring more than 12 teams (these competitions both had 16 teams, compared to the 20 teams in the men's Rugby World Cup).  On 21 August 2019, World Rugby announced that all future men's and women's World Cups would officially be known as \"Rugby World Cup\", with no sex or gender designations. The first tournament to be affected by this policy was the 2021 women's World Cup in New Zealand.[47]  World Rugby organised three international sevens tournaments - two annual Sevens Series (one for men and one for women) which are now defunct. The quadrennial Rugby World Cup Sevens is still active.  The men's season-long annual Sevens Series took place over 10 legs, each held in a different country. The women's Sevens Series is held over five- or six-legs. Both tournaments followed the same principle\u2014points are awarded based on a teams position in each round of the series, and the team with the most points at the end of the Series is crowned champions. Following the inclusion of rugby sevens into the Olympics, beginning with the 2014\u201315 series, the series prior to an Olympic event (i.e. the series which ends in the year before the Olympics takes place) forms the first phase of Olympic qualification. When Olympic Qualification was included, the top four teams from both the men's and women's series qualified for the Olympic Games, and remaining teams competed in regional competitions for one of the remaining places.  The quadrennial Rugby World Cup Sevens includes both the men's and women's world cup tournaments. It was originally due to be discontinued after the inclusion of rugby sevens into the Olympic Programme. However, it was later decided to retain the tournament, as it involved a significantly larger number of teams than the Olympics would, and to move the tournament so as to create a more even sevens calendar (with the major sevens events alternating every two years). As a result, the most recent tournament was the 2018 Rugby World Cup Sevens in San Francisco, USA.[48] The men's and women's competitions at this event were both won by New Zealand.  In 2023 World Rugby re-branded the Sevens series to a new World Rugby SVNS Series known as the HSBC SVNS. The new format will showcase the twelve best men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams, which will conclude in a Grand Final weekend where the top eight teams will compete to be crowned Series champions. The teams ranked ninth to twelfth will compete against the top four teams from a new Challenger Series in a relegation play-off to see who secures their place in the 2024-2025 season. Both men and women\u2019s teams will earn the same with equal participation fees. Both men and women will play in joint tournaments in eight cities around the world. Starting in December 2023 in Dubai, Cape Town, Perth, Vancouver, Los Angeles, Hong Kong, Singapore and will conclude in Madrid in June 2024. The tournament is set to bring about a festival type atmosphere and serve as a build up to the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.[49][50]  World Rugby organizes annual international competitions involving Tier 2 nations.  World Rugby organizes two competitions for under-20 national teams, the World Rugby Under 20 Championship and the World Rugby Under 20 Trophy. These competitions were created following the merger of under-19 and under-21 representative teams, into an under-20 age group  The sport of rugby union has been played at the Summer Olympics on four occasions, with the last being in 1924. The winners, and thus the reigning champions, were the U.S. team. Rugby union made one more appearance as a demonstration event but was then removed from the Games. World Rugby has most recently been very keen to see it return to the Games and is adamant that the sport (specifically referring to rugby sevens) satisfies every respect of the criteria set out in the Olympic Charter.  The main problem for reintroducing the 15-man game to the Olympics is the 7-day turnaround required by World Rugby regulations for players to rest between games. Since the Olympics only officially run for 16 days, with only slight expansions allowed to accommodate sports such as football, this effectively makes it impossible to conduct a 15s tournament within the current Olympic schedule. This limitation does not apply to sevens, as games last only 14 minutes (20 in championship finals) instead of the 80 minutes in the 15s game. All of the events in the current men's and women's Sevens Series, which feature a minimum of 16 national teams for men and 12 for women, are conducted within a single weekend.  But in furthering the World Rugby cause, the organisation became an International Olympic Committee Recognised International Federation in 1995, marked by a ceremonial signing by President Juan Antonio Samaranch prior to a match between Wales and South Africa in Cardiff.[51]  World Rugby cites rugby union's global participation, with men playing the game in well over 100 countries and women playing in over 50 as well; the organisation's compliance with the World Anti-Doping Code; and that a rugby sevens tournament could be (and generally is) accommodated in one stadium and is relatively inexpensive to play.[51] Not only is the sevens game successful in the context of the Sevens World Series and World Cup Sevens, it is also very successfully played in the Commonwealth Games; the sevens tournament at the 2006 Games in Melbourne set all-time attendance records for a sevens tournament.  As a result of this, World Rugby applied to the International Olympic Committee for a Sevens tournament to form part of the Olympics. Subsequently, Sevens was accepted into the Summer Olympic Games and was first played in 2016 in Rio de Janeiro which was won by Fiji in the men's competition (defeating Great Britain) and by Australia in the women's competition (defeating New Zealand). In the Tokyo Olympics 2020 edition, the Fiji 7s men's team and the New Zealand 7s women's team claimed the gold medals in their respective competitions.[52]  The laws of rugby union are controlled by a standing Laws Committee, which is established by the World Rugby Council. The current chairman of the committee is Bill Beaumont. The Laws of the Game are formulated by World Rugby, and are then circulated by the national Unions. The official laws of the game are written in English, French, Russian and Spanish. There are variations for under-19 and Sevens rugby. There are 21 regulations in total, these regulations range from definitions, eligibility, advertising, disciplinary, anti-doping and a number of other areas. World Rugby also approves equipment, which are tested at an Approved Testing House.  In 2006, the IRB initiated proposals for variations to the laws, which were formulated and trialled initially at Stellenbosch University in South Africa. Further trials were set down for 2007 and 2008. The law variations aimed to push the balance between defensive and attacking play more in favour of attacking play, and to reduce stoppages for penalties and infringements.  World Rugby is compliant with the WADA code. The World Rugby anti doping programme includes testing at the under 19 and under 21 level, sevens and senior 15 a side. Testing is a mix of in-competition at World Rugby organised events, as well as out-of-competition testing, which can occur during a specified one-hour time slot designated by a player. In 2003, World Cup year, the World Rugby member unions undertook approximately 3,000 tests.[53] \"Keep Rugby Clean\" is a campaign message run by the World Rugby Anti-Doping Manager Tim Ricketts. The programme is supported by stars such as Brian O'Driscoll.[54]  The following table has the Top 20 ranked men's rugby union countries in the world.[55]  The following table has the Top 20 ranked women's rugby union countries in the world.[57]    World Rugby publishes and maintains the World Rugby Rankings of the men's national rugby union teams (and more recently also for women's teams[59]). The concept was launched in October 2003, at the start of that year's world cup in Australia. The rankings are calculated using a Points Exchange system, whereby nations take points off each other based on a match result. Several years of research went into developing the rankings system, using an extensive database of international matches that date back to 1871.  The system's reliability is assessed in a number of objective ways, which includes predictions of current strength and responds to changes in form. The system takes into account home advantage, in that the home nation is treated as though it has an extra three rating points, effectively handicapping them, as they will gain fewer ranking points for a win, and lose more should they lose. In the case of a freak result, there is a maximum number of movements on the ranking that any nation can gain from one match.  If a nation does not play for a number of years they are considered dormant, and excluded from the rankings, upon returning, picking up from where they were excluded. If a nation is to merge or split, the highest rating of any of the rankings is inherited.  Currently all capped international matches are equally weighted, whether or not they take place within a competition or are played as tests; the sole exception to this is the World Cup final tournament.  The World Rugby Awards were introduced in 2001, to honour outstanding achievements in rugby union. Prior to 2009, all of the awards were announced at an annual ceremony; the most recent such ceremony was held in London on 23 November 2008.  However, as a response to the Great Recession, the annual ceremony only saw the International Player, Team, and Coach of the Year Awards presented in 2009 and 2010; all other awards were presented at different times throughout the year. The IRB reinstated a single year-end ceremony in 2011 after the 2011 Rugby World Cup.[60] Since then, it has chosen to present some awards at times relevant to those specific prizes\u2014such as Sevens awards after the London Sevens, the final event of the Sevens World Series, and the Junior Player award after the final of the Junior World Championship. The bulk of awards will be presented at the year-end Awards ceremony.  The current awards are:  At the year-end ceremony, the International Rugby Players' Association also hands out the following awards:  In the past, the following awards have also been awarded:  The awards that recognise achievements in the preceding 12 months tend to be won by that season's most successful nation(s): France in 2002, England in 2003, South Africa in 2004, New Zealand in 2005, South Africa again in 2007. For those award categories that have nominees, a shortlist is drawn up by an independent panel of judges, who are all former internationals. The panel then reconvenes to choose a winner. The current judges are Jonathan Davies, Will Greenwood, Gavin Hastings, Michael Jones, Dan Lyle, Federico M\u00e9ndez, Francois Pienaar and past Player of the Year winners Fabien Galthi\u00e9 and Keith Wood, with John Eales as convenor. The judges have a total of over 500 caps between them.  In 2006 a Hall of Fame was established to chronicle the achievements and special contribution of the sport's players, coaches, administrators, match officials, institutions and other individuals. The Hall of Fame was inaugurated at the 2006 IRB Awards, when William Webb Ellis and Rugby School were named as the first two inductees. Hall of Fame inductees in 2007 were Pierre de Coubertin, Danie Craven, John Eales, Gareth Edwards and Wilson Whineray. The 2008 inductees were the 1888\u201389 New Zealand Native football team and its organiser Joe Warbrick, Jack Kyle, Melrose RFC and Ned Haig (for their roles in the invention of rugby sevens), Hugo Porta, and Philippe Sella. Since then, induction ceremonies have been held annually, except in 2010.  The last year for a single induction ceremony was 2009. Starting in 2011, ceremonies have been held at multiple locations around the world. Also, some or all of the inductions have had an overriding theme since 2009: "},{"title":"List of islands of England","content":" This is a list of islands of England (excluding the mainland which is itself a part of the island of Great Britain), as well as a table of the largest English islands by area and by population.

They include: "},{"title":"United States","content":"  The United States of America (USA or U.S.A.), commonly known as the United States (US or U.S.) or America, is a country primarily located in North America. It is a federation of 50 states, a federal capital district (Washington, D.C.), and 326 Indian reservations. Outside the union of states, it asserts sovereignty over five major unincorporated island territories and various uninhabited islands.[j] The country has the world's third-largest land area,[d] second-largest exclusive economic zone, and third-largest population, exceeding 334 million.[k]  Paleo-Indians migrated across the Bering land bridge more than 12,000 years ago. British colonization led to the first settlement of the Thirteen Colonies in Virginia in 1607. Clashes with the British Crown over taxation and political representation sparked the American Revolution, with the Second Continental Congress formally declaring independence on July 4, 1776. Following its victory in the Revolutionary War (1775\u20131783), the country continued to expand across North America. As more states were admitted, sectional division over slavery led to the secession of the Confederate States of America, which fought the remaining states of the Union during the 1861\u20131865 American Civil War. With the Union's victory and preservation, slavery was abolished nationally. By 1890, the United States had established itself as a great power. After Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the U.S. entered World War II. The aftermath of the war left the U.S. and the Soviet Union as the world's two superpowers and led to the Cold War, during which both countries engaged in a struggle for ideological dominance and international influence. Following the Soviet Union's collapse and the end of the Cold War in 1991, the U.S. emerged as the world's sole superpower.  The U.S. national government is a presidential constitutional republic and liberal democracy with three separate branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. It has a bicameral national legislature composed of the House of Representatives, a lower house based on population; and the Senate, an upper house based on equal representation for each state. Substantial autonomy is given to states and several territories, with a political culture that emphasizes liberty, equality under the law, individualism, and limited government.  One of the world's most developed countries, the United States has had the largest nominal GDP since 1890 and accounted for 15% of the global economy in 2023.[l] It possesses by far the largest amount of wealth of any country and the highest disposable household income per capita among OECD countries.[20] The U.S. ranks among the world's highest in economic competitiveness, productivity, innovation, human rights, and higher education. Its hard power and cultural influence have a global reach. The U.S. is a founding member of the World Bank, IMF, Organization of American States, NATO, World Health Organization, and a permanent member of the UN Security Council.  The first documentary evidence of the phrase \"United States of America\" dates to a letter from January 2, 1776, written by Stephen Moylan, a Continental Army aide to General George Washington, to Joseph Reed, Washington's aide-de-camp. Moylan expressed his desire to go \"with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain\" to seek assistance in the Revolutionary War effort.[21][22] The first known publication of the phrase \"United States of America\" was in an anonymous essay in The Virginia Gazette newspaper in Williamsburg, on April\u00a06, 1776.[23]  By June 1776, the name \"United States of America\" appeared in drafts of the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, authored by John Dickinson, a Founding Father from the Province of Pennsylvania,[24][25] and in the Declaration of Independence, written primarily by Thomas Jefferson and adopted by the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, on July 4, 1776.[24][26]  The first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia across the Bering land bridge at least 12,000 years ago;[28][29] the Clovis culture, which appeared around 11,000 BC, is believed to be the first widespread culture in the Americas.[30][31] Over time, indigenous North American cultures grew increasingly sophisticated, and some, such as the Mississippian culture, developed agriculture, architecture, and complex societies.[32] Indigenous peoples and cultures such as the Algonquian peoples,[33] Ancestral Puebloans,[34] and the Iroquois developed across the present-day United States.[35] Native population estimates of what is now the United States before the arrival of European immigrants range from around 500,000[36][37] to nearly 10 million.[37][38]  Christopher Columbus began exploring the Caribbean in 1492, leading to Spanish settlements in present-day Puerto Rico, Florida, and New Mexico.[39][40][41] France established its own settlements along the Mississippi River and Gulf of Mexico.[42] British colonization of the East Coast began with the Virginia Colony (1607) and Plymouth Colony (1620).[43][44] The Mayflower Compact and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut established precedents for representative self-governance and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.[45][46] While European settlers in what is now the United States experienced conflicts with Native Americans, they also engaged in trade, exchanging European tools for food and animal pelts.[47][m] Relations ranged from close cooperation to warfare and massacres. The colonial authorities often pursued policies that forced Native Americans to adopt European lifestyles, including conversion to Christianity.[51][52] Along the eastern seaboard, settlers trafficked African slaves through the Atlantic slave trade.[53]  The original Thirteen Colonies[n] that would later found the United States were administered by Great Britain,[54] and had local governments with elections open to most white male property owners.[55][56] The colonial population grew rapidly, eclipsing Native American populations;[57] by the 1770s, the natural increase of the population was such that only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.[58] The colonies' distance from Britain allowed for the development of self-governance,[59] and the First Great Awakening, a series of Christian revivals, fueled colonial interest in religious liberty.[60]  After winning the French and Indian War, Britain began to assert greater control over local colonial affairs, creating colonial political resistance; one of the primary colonial grievances was a denial of their rights as Englishmen, particularly the right to representation in the British government that taxed them. In 1774, the First Continental Congress met in Philadelphia, and passed a colonial boycott of British goods that proved effective. The British attempt to then disarm the colonists resulted in the 1775 Battles of Lexington and Concord, igniting the American Revolutionary War. At the Second Continental Congress, the colonies appointed George Washington commander-in-chief of the Continental Army and created a committee led by Thomas Jefferson to write the Declaration of Independence, adopted on July 4, 1776.[61] The political values of the American Revolution included liberty, inalienable individual rights; and the sovereignty of the people;[62] supporting republicanism and rejecting monarchy, aristocracy, and hereditary political power; virtue and faithfulness in the performance of civic duties; and vilification of corruption.[63] The Founding Fathers of the United States, which included George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, John Jay, James Madison, Thomas Paine, and John Adams, were inspired by Greco-Roman, Renaissance, and Age of Enlightenment philosophies and ideas.[64][65]  After the British surrender at the siege of Yorktown in 1781, American sovereignty was internationally recognized by the Treaty of Paris (1783), through which the U.S. gained territory stretching west to the Mississippi River, north to present-day Canada, and south to Spanish Florida.[66] Ratified in 1781, the Articles of Confederation established a decentralized government that operated until 1789.[61] The Northwest Ordinance (1787) established the precedent by which the country's territory would expand with the admission of new states, rather than the expansion of existing states.[67] The U.S. Constitution was drafted at the 1787 Constitutional Convention to overcome the limitations of the Articles; it went into effect in 1789, creating a federation administered by three branches on the principle of checks and balances.[68] Washington was elected the country's first president under the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights was adopted in 1791 to allay concerns by skeptics of the more centralized government;[69][70] his resignations first as commander-in-chief after the Revolution and later as president set a precedent followed by John Adams, establishing the peaceful transfer of power between rival parties.[71][72]  In the late 18th century, American settlers began to expand westward, some with a sense of manifest destiny.[73] The Louisiana Purchase (1803) from France nearly doubled the territory of the United States.[74] Lingering issues with Britain remained, leading to the War of 1812, which was fought to a draw.[75] Spain ceded Florida and its Gulf Coast territory in 1819.[76] The Missouri Compromise attempted to balance desires of northern states to prevent expansion of slavery in the country with those of southern states to expand it, admitting Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state and declared a policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining Louisiana Purchase lands north of the 36\u00b030\u2032 parallel.[77] As Americans expanded further into land inhabited by Native Americans, the federal government often applied policies of Indian removal or assimilation.[78][79] The infamous Trail of Tears (1830\u20131850) was a U.S. government policy that forcibly removed and displaced most Native Americans living east of the Mississippi River to lands far to the west. These and earlier organized displacements prompted a long series of American Indian Wars west of the Mississippi.[80][81] The Republic of Texas was annexed in 1845,[82] and the 1846 Oregon Treaty led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.[83] Victory in the Mexican\u2013American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest.[73][84] The California Gold Rush of 1848\u20131849 spurred a huge migration of white settlers to the Pacific coast, leading to even more confrontations with Native populations. One of the most violent, the California genocide of thousands of Native inhabitants, lasted into the early 1870s,[85][86] just as additional western territories and states were created.[87]  During the colonial period, slavery was legal in the American colonies, though the practice began to be significantly questioned during the American Revolution.[88] States in The North enacted abolition laws,[89] though support for slavery strengthened in Southern states, as inventions such as the cotton gin made the institution increasingly profitable for Southern elites.[90][91][92] This sectional conflict regarding slavery culminated in the American Civil War (1861\u20131865).[93][94]  Eleven slave states seceded and formed the Confederate States of America, while the other states remained in the Union.[95] War broke out in April 1861 after the Confederacy bombarded Fort Sumter.[96] After the January 1863 Emancipation Proclamation, many freed slaves joined the Union Army.[97] The war began to turn in the Union's favor following the 1863 Siege of Vicksburg and Battle of Gettysburg, and the Confederacy surrendered in 1865 after the Union's victory in the Battle of Appomattox Court House.[98]  The Reconstruction era followed the war. After the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, Reconstruction Amendments were passed to protect the rights of African Americans. National infrastructure, including transcontinental telegraph and railroads, spurred growth in the American frontier.[99]  From 1865 through 1917 an unprecedented stream of immigrants arrived in the United States, including 24.4 million from Europe.[102] Most came through the port of New York City, and New York City and other large cities on the East Coast became home to large Jewish, Irish, and Italian populations, while many Germans and Central Europeans moved to the Midwest. At the same time, about one million French Canadians migrated from Quebec to New England.[103] During the Great Migration, millions of African Americans left the rural South for urban areas in the North.[104] Alaska was purchased from Russia in 1867.[105]  The Compromise of 1877 effectively ended Reconstruction and white supremacists took local control of Southern politics.[106][107] African Americans endured a period of heightened, overt racism following Reconstruction, a time often called the nadir of American race relations.[108][109] A series of Supreme Court decisions, including Plessy v. Ferguson, emptied the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments of their force, allowing Jim Crow laws in the South to remain unchecked, sundown towns in the Midwest, and segregation in cities across the country, which would be reinforced by the policy of redlining later adopted by the federal Home Owners' Loan Corporation.[110]  An explosion of technological advancement accompanied by the exploitation of cheap immigrant labor[111] led to rapid economic development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, allowing the United States to outpace England, France, and Germany combined.[112][113] This fostered the amassing of power by a few prominent industrialists, largely by their formation of trusts and monopolies to prevent competition.[114] Tycoons led the nation's expansion in the railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. The United States emerged as a pioneer of the automotive industry.[115] These changes were accompanied by significant increases in economic inequality, slum conditions, and social unrest, creating the environment for labor unions to begin to flourish.[116][117][118] This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which was characterized by significant reforms.[119][120]  Pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy; the islands were annexed in 1898. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines were ceded by Spain following the Spanish\u2013American War.[121] American Samoa was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the Second Samoan Civil War.[122] The U.S. Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark in 1917.[123] The United States entered World War I alongside the Allies of World War I, helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers.[124] In 1920, a constitutional amendment granted nationwide women's suffrage.[125] During the 1920s and 30s, radio for mass communication and the invention of early television transformed communications nationwide.[126] The Wall Street Crash of 1929 triggered the Great Depression, which President Franklin D. Roosevelt responded to with New Deal social and economic policies.[127][128]  At first neutral during World War II, the U.S. began supplying war materiel to the Allies of World War II in March 1941 and entered the war in December after the Empire of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor.[129][130] The U.S. developed the first nuclear weapons and used them against the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, ending the war.[131][132] The United States was one of the \"Four Policemen\" who met to plan the postwar world, alongside the United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and China.[133][134] The U.S. emerged relatively unscathed from the war, with even greater economic and international political influence.[135]  After World War II, the United States entered the Cold War, where geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union led the two countries to dominate world affairs.[136] The U.S. engaged in regime change against governments perceived to be aligned with the Soviet Union, and competed in the Space Race, culminating in the first crewed Moon landing in 1969.[137][138][139][140]  Domestically, the U.S. experienced economic growth, urbanization, and population growth following World War II.[141] The civil rights movement emerged, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader in the early 1960s.[142] The Great Society plan of President Lyndon Johnson's administration resulted in groundbreaking and broad-reaching laws, policies and a constitutional amendment to counteract some of the worst effects of lingering institutional racism.[143] The counterculture movement in the U.S. brought significant social changes, including the liberalization of attitudes toward recreational drug use and sexuality. It also encouraged open defiance of the military draft (leading to the end of conscription in 1973) and wide opposition to U.S. intervention in Vietnam (with the U.S. totally withdrawing in 1975).[144][145][146] The societal shift in the roles of women partly resulted in large increases in female labor participation in the 1970s, and by 1985 the majority of women aged 16 and older were employed.[147] The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which marked the end of the Cold War and solidified the U.S. as the world's sole superpower.[148][149][150][151]  The 1990s saw the longest recorded economic expansion in American history, a dramatic decline in crime, and advances in technology, with the World Wide Web, the evolution of the Pentium microprocessor in accordance with Moore's law, rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, the first gene therapy trial, and cloning all emerging and being improved upon throughout the decade. The Human Genome Project was formally launched in 1990, while Nasdaq became the first stock market in the United States to trade online in 1998.[152] In 1991, an American-led international coalition of states expelled an Iraqi invasion force from Kuwait in the Gulf War.[153]  The September 11 attacks in 2001 by the pan-Islamist militant organization al-Qaeda led to the war on terror and subsequent military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq.[154][155] The cultural impact of the attacks was profound and long-lasting.  The U.S. housing bubble culminated in 2007 with the Great Recession, the largest economic contraction since the Great Depression.[156] Coming to a head in the 2010s, political polarization increased as sociopolitical debates on cultural issues dominated politics.[157] This polarization was capitalized upon in the January 2021 Capitol attack,[158] when a mob of protesters entered the U.S. Capitol and attempted to prevent the peaceful transfer of power.[159]  The United States is the world's third-largest country by total area behind Russia and Canada.[d][160][161] The 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia occupy a combined area of 3,119,885 square miles (8,080,470\u00a0km2).[162][163] The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way to inland forests and rolling hills in the Piedmont plateau region.[164]  The Appalachian Mountains and the Adirondack massif separate the East Coast from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest.[165] The Mississippi River System, the world's fourth-longest river system, runs predominantly north\u2013south through the heart of the country. The flat and fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.[165]  The Rocky Mountains, west of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, peaking at over 14,000 feet (4,300\u00a0m) in Colorado.[166] Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and Chihuahua, Sonoran, and Mojave deserts.[167] In the northwest corner of Arizona, carved by the Colorado River over millions of years, is the Grand Canyon, a steep-sided canyon and popular tourist destination known for its overwhelming visual size and intricate, colorful landscape.  The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast. The lowest and highest points in the contiguous United States are in the state of California,[168] about 84 miles (135\u00a0km) apart.[169] At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5\u00a0m), Alaska's Denali is the highest peak in the country and continent.[170] Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska's Alexander and Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the Rockies is the continent's largest volcanic feature.[171] In 2021, the United States had 8% of global permanent meadows and pastures and 10% of cropland.[172]  With its large size and geographic variety, the United States includes most climate types. East of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south.[173] The western Great Plains are semi-arid. Many mountainous areas of the American West have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon, Washington, and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii, the southern tip of Florida and U.S. territories in the Caribbean and Pacific are tropical.[174]  States bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur in the country, mainly in Tornado Alley.[175] Overall, the United States receives more high-impact extreme weather incidents than any other country.[176] Extreme weather became more frequent in the U.S. in the 21st century, with three times the number of reported heat waves as in the 1960s. In the American Southwest, droughts became more persistent and more severe.[177]    The U.S. is one of 17 megadiverse countries containing large numbers of endemic species: about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and over 1,800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland.[179] The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 birds, 311 reptiles, 295 amphibians,[180] and 91,000 insect species.[181]  There are 63 national parks, and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas, managed by the National Park Service and other agencies.[182] About 28% of the country's land is publicly owned and federally managed,[183] primarily in the western states.[184] Most of this land is protected, though some is leased for commercial use, and less than one percent is used for military purposes.[185][186]  Environmental issues in the United States include debates on non-renewable resources and nuclear energy, air and water pollution, biodiversity, logging and deforestation,[187][188] and climate change.[189][190] The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the federal agency charged with addressing most environmental-related issues.[191] The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act.[192] The Endangered Species Act of 1973 provides a way to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service implements and enforces the Act.[193] As of 2022[update], the U.S. ranked 43rd among 180 countries in the Environmental Performance Index.[194] The country joined the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2016 and has many other environmental commitments.[195]  The United States is a federal republic of 50 states, with its capital in a federal district, asserting sovereignty over five unincorporated territories and several uninhabited island possessions (some of which are disputed).[196][197] It is the world's oldest surviving federation, and, according to the World Economic Forum, the oldest democracy as well.[198] It is a liberal representative democracy \"in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law.\"[199] The Constitution of the United States serves as the country's supreme legal document, also establishing the structure and responsibilities of the national federal government and its relationship with the individual states.[200]  Composed of three branches, all headquartered in Washington, D.C., the federal government is the national government of the United States. It is regulated by a strong system of checks and balances.[201]  The three-branch system is known as the presidential system, in contrast to the parliamentary system, where the executive is part of the legislative body. Many countries around the world copied this aspect of the 1789 Constitution of the United States, especially in the Americas.[209]  The Constitution is silent on political parties. However, they developed independently in the 18th century with the Federalist and Anti-Federalist parties.[210] Since then, the United States has operated as a de facto two-party system, though the parties in that system have been different at different times.  The two main national parties are presently the Democratic and the Republican. The former is perceived as relatively liberal in its political platform while the latter is perceived as relatively conservative.[211] Each has a primary system to nominate a presidential ticket, and each runs candidates for other offices in every state in the Union. Other smaller and less influential parties exist but do not have the national scope and breadth of the two main parties.  In the American federal system, sovereign powers are shared between two levels of elected government: national and state. People in the states are also represented by local elected governments, which are administrative divisions of the states.[212] States are subdivided into counties or county equivalents, and further divided into municipalities. The District of Columbia is a federal district that contains the capital of the United States, the city of Washington.[213] The territories and the District of Columbia are administrative divisions of the federal government.[214] Federally recognized tribes govern 326[215] Indian reservations.  The United States has an established structure of foreign relations, and it has the world's second-largest diplomatic corps as of 2024[update]. It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council,[216] and home to the United Nations headquarters.[217] The United States is a member of the G7,[218] G20,[219] and OECD intergovernmental organizations.[220] Almost all countries have embassies and many have consulates (official representatives) in the country. Likewise, nearly all countries host formal diplomatic missions with the United States, except Iran,[221] North Korea,[222] and Bhutan.[223] Though Taiwan does not have formal diplomatic relations with the U.S., it maintains close unofficial relations.[224] The United States regularly supplies Taiwan with military equipment to deter potential Chinese aggression.[225] Its geopolitical attention also turned to the Indo-Pacific when the United States joined the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue with Australia, India, and Japan.[226]  The United States has a \"Special Relationship\" with the United Kingdom[227] and strong ties with Canada,[228] Australia,[229] New Zealand,[230] the Philippines,[231] Japan,[232] South Korea,[233] Israel,[234] and several European Union countries (France, Italy, Germany, Spain, and Poland).[235] The U.S. works closely with its NATO allies on military and national security issues, and with countries in the Americas through the Organization of American States and the United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Free Trade Agreement. In South America, Colombia is traditionally considered to be the closest ally of the United States.[236] The U.S. exercises full international defense authority and responsibility for Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau through the Compact of Free Association.[237] It has increasingly conducted strategic cooperation with India,[238] but its ties with China have steadily deteriorated.[239][240] Since 2014, the U.S. has become a key ally of Ukraine;[241] it has also provided the country with significant military equipment and other support in response to Russia's 2022 invasion.[242]  The President is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces and appoints its leaders, the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Department of Defense, which is headquartered at the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., administers five of the six service branches, which are made up of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Space Force. The Coast Guard is administered by the Department of Homeland Security in peacetime and can be transferred to the Department of the Navy in wartime.[243]  The United States spent $916 billion on its military in 2023, which is by far the largest amount of any country, making up 37% of global military spending and accounting for 3.4% of the country's GDP.[244][245] The U.S. has 45% of the world's nuclear weapons, the second-largest amount after Russia.[246]  The United States has the third-largest combined armed forces in the world, behind the Chinese People's Liberation Army and Indian Armed Forces.[247] The military operates about 800 bases and facilities abroad,[248] and maintains deployments greater than 100 active duty personnel in 25 foreign countries.[249]  There are about 18,000 U.S. police agencies from local to national level in the United States.[250] Law in the United States is mainly enforced by local police departments and sheriff departments in their municipal or county jurisdictions. The state police departments have authority in their respective state, and federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service have national jurisdiction and specialized duties, such as protecting civil rights, national security and enforcing U.S. federal courts' rulings and federal laws.[251] State courts conduct most civil and criminal trials,[252] and federal courts handle designated crimes and appeals of state court decisions.[253]  As of January 2023, the United States has the sixth highest per-capita incarceration rate in the world, at 531 people per 100,000; and the largest prison and jail population in the world with almost 2\u00a0million people incarcerated.[254][255][256] An analysis of the World Health Organization Mortality Database from 2010 showed U.S. homicide rates \"were 7 times higher than in other high-income countries, driven by a gun homicide rate that was 25 times higher.\"[257]  The U.S. has been the world's largest economy nominally since about 1890.[260] The 2023 nominal U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) of $27\u00a0trillion was the largest in the world, constituting over 25% of the global economy or 15% at purchasing power parity (PPP).[261][13] From 1983 to 2008, U.S. real compounded annual GDP growth was 3.3%, compared to a 2.3% weighted average for the rest of the Group of Seven.[262] The country ranks first in the world by nominal GDP,[263] second when adjusted for purchasing power parities (PPP),[13] and ninth by GDP (PPP) per capita.[13] It possesses the highest disposable household income per capita among OECD countries.[264]  Of the world's 500 largest companies, 136 are headquartered in the U.S.[265] The U.S. dollar is the currency most used in international transactions and is the world's foremost reserve currency, backed by the country's dominant economy, its military, the petrodollar system, and its linked eurodollar and large U.S. treasuries market.[258] Several countries use it as their official currency and in others it is the de facto currency.[266][267] It has free trade agreements with several countries, including the USMCA.[268] The U.S. ranked second in the Global Competitiveness Report in 2019, after Singapore.[269] While its economy has reached a post-industrial level of development, the United States remains an industrial power.[270] As of 2021[update], the U.S. is the second-largest manufacturing country after China.[271]  New York City is the world's principal financial center[273][274] and the epicenter of the world's largest metropolitan economy.[275] The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, both located in New York City, are the world's two largest stock exchanges by market capitalization and trade volume.[276][277] The United States is at or near the forefront of technological advancement and innovation[278] in many economic fields, especially in artificial intelligence; computers; pharmaceuticals; and medical, aerospace and military equipment.[279] The country's economy is fueled by abundant natural resources, a well-developed infrastructure, and high productivity.[280] The largest U.S. trading partners are the European Union, Mexico, Canada, China, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Vietnam, India, and Taiwan.[281] The United States is the world's largest importer and the second-largest exporter after China.[282] It is by far the world's largest exporter of services.[283]  Americans have the highest average household and employee income among OECD member states,[284] and the fourth-highest median household income,[285] up from sixth-highest in 2013.[286] Wealth in the United States is highly concentrated; the richest 10% of the adult population own 72% of the country's household wealth, while the bottom 50% own just 2%.[287] Income inequality in the U.S. remains at record highs,[288] with the top fifth of earners taking home more than half of all income[289] and giving the U.S. one of the widest income distributions among OECD members.[290][291] The U.S. ranks first in the number of dollar billionaires and millionaires, with 735 billionaires and nearly 22 million millionaires (as of 2023).[292] There were about 582,500 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons in the U.S. in 2022, with 60% staying in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program.[293] In 2018, six million children experienced food insecurity.[294] Feeding America estimates that around one in seven, or approximately 11 million, children experience hunger and do not know where they will get their next meal or when.[295] As of 2021,[update] 38\u00a0million people, about 12% of the U.S. population, were living in poverty.[296]  The United States has a smaller welfare state and redistributes less income through government action than most other high-income countries.[297][298] It is the only advanced economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation nationally[299] and is one of a few countries in the world without federal paid family leave as a legal right.[300] The United States has a higher percentage of low-income workers than almost any other developed country, largely because of a weak collective bargaining system and lack of government support for at-risk workers.[301]  The United States has been a leader in technological innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. Methods for producing interchangeable parts and the establishment of a machine tool industry enabled the large-scale manufacturing of U.S. consumer products in the late 19th century. By the early 20th century, factory electrification, the introduction of the assembly line, and other labor-saving techniques created the system of mass production.[302] The United States is a leader in the development of artificial intelligence technology and has maintained a space program since the late 1950s, with plans for long-term habitation of the Moon.[303][304]  In 2022, the United States was the country with the second-highest number of published scientific papers.[305] As of 2021, the U.S. ranked second by the number of patent applications, and third by trademark and industrial design applications.[306] In 2023, the United States ranked 3rd in the Global Innovation Index.[307]  As of 2022[update], the United States receives approximately 81% of its energy from fossil fuel and the largest source of the country's energy came from petroleum (35.8%), followed by natural gas (33.4%), renewable sources (13.3%), coal (9.8%), and nuclear power (8%).[308][309] The United States constitutes less than 5% of the world's population, but consumes 17% of the world's energy.[310][311] The U.S. ranks as the second-highest emitter of greenhouse gases.[312]  Personal transportation in the United States is dominated by automobiles,[314][315] which operate on a network of 4\u00a0million miles (6.4\u00a0million kilometers) of public roads, making it the longest network in the world.[316][317] The Oldsmobile Curved Dash and the Ford Model T, both American cars, are considered the first mass-produced[318] and mass-affordable[319] cars, respectively. As of 2022, the United States is the second-largest manufacturer of motor vehicles[320] and is home to Tesla, the world's most valuable car company.[321] American automotive company General Motors held the title of the world's best-selling automaker from 1931 to 2008.[322] The American automotive industry is the world's second-largest automobile market by sales, having been overtaken by China in 2010,[323] and the U.S. has the highest vehicle ownership per capita in the world,[324] with 910 vehicles per 1000 people.[325] The United States's rail transport network, the longest network in the world,[326] handles mostly freight.[327][328]  The American civil airline industry is entirely privately owned and has been largely deregulated since 1978, while most major airports are publicly owned.[329] The three largest airlines in the world by passengers carried are U.S.-based; American Airlines is number one after its 2013 acquisition by US Airways.[330] Of the world's 50 busiest passenger airports, 16 are in the United States, including the top five and the busiest, Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport.[331][332] As of 2022[update], there are 19,969 airports in the U.S., of which 5,193 are designated as \"public use\", including for general aviation and other activities.[333]  Of the fifty busiest container ports, four are located in the United States, of which the busiest is the Port of Los Angeles.[334] The country's inland waterways are the world's fifth-longest, and total 41,009\u00a0km (25,482\u00a0mi).[335]  The U.S. Census Bureau reported 331,449,281 residents as of April 1, 2020,[o][336] making the United States the third-most-populous country in the world, after China and India.[337] According to the Bureau's U.S. Population Clock, on January\u00a028, 2021, the U.S. population had a net gain of one person every 100 seconds, or about 864 people per day.[338] In 2018, 52% of Americans age 15 and over were married, 6% were widowed, 10% were divorced, and 32% had never been married.[339] In 2021, the total fertility rate for the U.S. stood at 1.7 children per woman,[340] and it had the world's highest rate of children (23%) living in single-parent households in 2019.[341] As of 2023, the five most populous states in the nation are California (38.9 million), Texas (30.5 million), Florida (22.6 million), New York (19.5 million), and Pennsylvania (12.9 million).  The United States has a diverse population; 37 ancestry groups have more than one million members.[342] White Americans with ancestry from Europe, the Middle East or North Africa, form the largest racial and ethnic group at 57.8% of the United States population.[343][344] Hispanic and Latino Americans form the second-largest group and are 18.7% of the United States population. African Americans constitute the country's third-largest ancestry group and are 12.1% of the total U.S. population.[342] Asian Americans are the country's fourth-largest group, composing 5.9% of the United States population. The country's 3.7 million Native Americans account for about 1%,[342] and some 574 native tribes are  recognized by the federal government.[345] In 2020, the median age of the United States population was 38.5 years.[337]  While many languages are spoken in the United States, English is by far the most commonly spoken and written.[346] Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws, such as U.S. naturalization requirements, standardize English, and most states have declared it the official language.[347] Three states and four U.S. territories have recognized local or indigenous languages in addition to English, including Hawaii (Hawaiian),[348] Alaska (twenty Native languages),[p][349] South Dakota (Sioux),[350] American Samoa (Samoan), Puerto Rico (Spanish), Guam (Chamorro), and the Northern Mariana Islands (Carolinian and Chamorro). In total, 169 Native American languages are spoken in the United States.[351] In Puerto Rico, Spanish is more widely spoken than English.[352]  According to the American Community Survey in 2010, some 229 million people out of the total U.S. population of 308 million spoke only English at home. About 37 million spoke Spanish at home, making it the second most commonly used language. Other languages spoken at home by one million people or more include Chinese (2.8 million), Tagalog (1.6 million), Vietnamese (1.4 million), French (1.3 million), Korean (1.1 million), and German (1 million).[353]  America's immigrant population, 51 million, is by far the world's largest in absolute terms.[354][355] In 2022, there were 87.7 million immigrants and U.S.-born children of immigrants in the United States, accounting for nearly 27% of the overall U.S. population.[356] In 2017, out of the U.S. foreign-born population, some 45% (20.7\u00a0million) were naturalized citizens, 27% (12.3\u00a0million) were lawful permanent residents, 6% (2.2\u00a0million) were temporary lawful residents, and 23% (10.5\u00a0million) were unauthorized immigrants.[357] In 2019, the top countries of origin for immigrants were Mexico (24% of immigrants), India (6%), China (5%), the Philippines (4.5%), and El Salvador (3%).[358] The United States has led the world in refugee resettlement for decades, admitting more refugees than the rest of the world combined.[359]  Religious affiliation in the U.S., according to a 2022 Gallup poll:[7]  The First Amendment guarantees the free exercise of religion and forbids Congress from passing laws respecting its establishment.[360][361] Religious practice is widespread, among the most diverse in the world,[362] and profoundly vibrant.[363] The country has the world's largest Christian population.[364] A majority of the global Jewish population lives in the United States, as measured by the Law of Return.[365] Other notable faiths include Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, many New Age movements, and Native American religions.[366] Religious practice varies significantly by region.[367] \"Ceremonial deism\" is common in American culture.[368]  The overwhelming majority of Americans believe in a higher power or spiritual force, engage in spiritual practices such as prayer, and consider themselves religious or spiritual.[369][370] In the \"Bible Belt\", located within the Southern United States, evangelical Protestantism plays a significant role culturally, whereas New England and the Western United States tend to be more secular.[367] Mormonism\u2014a Restorationist movement, whose members migrated westward from Missouri and Illinois under the leadership of Brigham Young in 1847 after the assassination of Joseph Smith[371]\u2014remains the predominant religion in Utah to this day.[372]  About 82% of Americans live in urban areas, including suburbs;[160] about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000.[373] In 2022, 333 incorporated municipalities had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four cities (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston) had populations exceeding two million.[374] Many U.S. metropolitan populations are growing rapidly, particularly in the South and West.[375]     According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), average American life expectancy at birth was 77.5 years in 2022 (74.8 years for men and 80.2 years for women). This was a gain of 1.1 years from 76.4 years in 2021, but the CDC noted that the new average \"didn't fully offset the loss of 2.4 years between 2019 and 2021\". The COVID pandemic and higher overall mortality due to opioid overdoses and suicides were held mostly responsible for the previous drop in life expectancy.[380] The same report stated that the 2022 gains in average U.S. life expectancy were especially significant for men, Hispanics, and American Indian\u2013Alaskan Native people (AIAN). Starting in 1998, the life expectancy in the U.S. fell behind that of other wealthy industrialized countries, and Americans' \"health disadvantage\" gap has been increasing ever since.[381] The U.S. has one of the highest suicide rates among high-income countries.[382] Approximately one-third of the U.S. adult population is obese and another third is overweight.[383] The U.S. healthcare system far outspends that of any other country, measured both in per capita spending and as a percentage of GDP, but attains worse healthcare outcomes when compared to peer countries for reasons that are debated.[384] The United States is the only developed country without a system of universal healthcare, and a significant proportion of the population that does not carry health insurance.[385] Government-funded healthcare coverage for the poor (Medicaid) and for those age 65 and older (Medicare) is available to Americans who meet the programs' income or age qualifications. In 2010, former President Obama passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.[q][386]  American primary and secondary education (known in the U.S. as K-12, \"kindergarten through 12th grade\") is decentralized. It is operated by state, territorial, and sometimes municipal governments and regulated by the U.S. Department of Education. In general, children are required to attend school or an approved homeschool from the age of five or six (kindergarten or first grade) until they are 18 years old. This often brings students through the 12th grade, the final year of a U.S. high school, but some states and territories allow them to leave school earlier, at age 16 or 17.[387] The U.S. spends more on education per student than any country in the world,[388] an average of $12,794 per year per public elementary and secondary school student in 2016\u20132017.[389] Among Americans age 25 and older, 84.6% graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a bachelor's degree, and 9.6% earned a graduate degree.[390] The U.S. literacy rate is near-universal.[160][391] The country has the most Nobel Prize winners in history, with 411 (having won 413 awards).[392][393]  U.S. tertiary or higher education has earned a global reputation. Many of the world's top universities, as listed by various ranking organizations, are in the United States, including 19 of the top 25.[394][395] American higher education is dominated by state university systems, although the country's many private universities and colleges enroll about 20% of all American students. Large amounts of federal financial aid are provided to students in the form of grants and loans.  Colleges and universities directly funded by the federal government are limited to military personnel and government employees and include the U.S. service academies, the Naval Postgraduate School, and military staff colleges. Local community colleges generally offer coursework and degree programs covering the first two years of college study. They often have more open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition.[396]  As for public expenditures on higher education, the U.S. spends more per student than the OECD average, and more than all nations in combined public and private spending.[397] Despite some student loan forgiveness programs in place,[398] student loan debt has increased by 102% in the last decade,[399] and exceeded 1.7\u00a0trillion dollars as of 2022.[400]  Americans have traditionally been characterized by a unifying political belief in an \"American creed\" emphasizing liberty, equality under the law, democracy, social equality, property rights, and a preference for limited government.[402][403] Culturally, the country has been described as having the values of individualism and personal autonomy,[404][405] having a strong work ethic,[406] competitiveness,[407] and voluntary altruism towards others.[408][409][410] According to a 2016 study by the Charities Aid Foundation, Americans donated 1.44% of total GDP to charity, the highest rate in the world by a large margin.[411] The United States is home to a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values. It has acquired significant cultural and economic soft power.[412][413]  Nearly all present Americans or their ancestors came from Europe, Africa, and Asia (\"the Old World\") within the past five centuries.[414] Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa.[415] More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl, with immigrants contributing to, and often assimilating into, mainstream American culture. The American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.[416] Whether this perception is accurate has been a topic of debate.[417][418][419] While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society,[420] scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values.[421] Americans tend to greatly value socioeconomic achievement, but being ordinary or average is promoted by some as a noble condition as well.[422]  The United States is considered to have the strongest protections of free speech of any country under the First Amendment,[423] which protects flag desecration, hate speech, blasphemy, and lese-majesty as forms of protected expression.[424][425][426] A 2016 Pew Research Center poll found that Americans were the most supportive of free expression of any polity measured.[427] They are the \"most supportive of freedom of the press and the right to use the Internet without government censorship.\"[428] It is a socially progressive country[429] with permissive attitudes surrounding human sexuality.[430] LGBT rights in the United States are advanced by global standards.[430][431][432]  Colonial American authors were influenced by John Locke and various other Enlightenment philosophers.[434][435] Before and shortly after the Revolutionary War, the newspaper rose to prominence, filling a demand for anti-British national literature.[436][437] Led by Ralph Waldo Emerson and Margaret Fuller in New England,[438] transcendentalism branched from Unitarianism as the first major American philosophical movement.[439][440] During the nineteenth-century American Renaissance, writers like Walt Whitman and Harriet Beecher Stowe established a distinctive American literary tradition.[441][442] As literacy rates rose, periodicals published more stories centered around industrial workers, women, and the rural poor.[443][444] Naturalism, regionalism, and realism\u2014the latter associated with Mark Twain\u2014were the major literary movements of the period.[445][446]  While modernism generally took on an international character, modernist authors working within the United States more often rooted their work in specific regions, peoples, and cultures.[447] Following the Great Migration to northern cities, African-American and black West Indian authors of the Harlem Renaissance developed an independent tradition of literature that rebuked a history of inequality and celebrated black culture. An important cultural export during the Jazz Age, these writings were a key influence on the n\u00e9gritude philosophy.[448][449] In the 1950s, an ideal of homogeneity led many authors to attempt to write the Great American Novel,[450] while the Beat Generation rejected this conformity, using styles that elevated the impact of the spoken word over mechanics to describe drug use, sexuality, and the failings of society.[451][452] Contemporary literature is more pluralistic than in previous eras, with the closest thing to a unifying feature being a trend toward self-conscious experiments with language.[453]  Media is broadly uncensored, with the First Amendment providing significant protections, as reiterated in New York Times Co. v. United States.[423] The four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), American Broadcasting Company (ABC), and Fox Broadcasting Company (FOX). The four major broadcast television networks are all commercial entities. Cable television offers hundreds of channels catering to a variety of niches.[454] As of 2021[update], about 83% of Americans over age 12 listen to broadcast radio, while about 40% listen to podcasts.[455] As of 2020[update], there were 15,460 licensed full-power radio stations in the U.S. according to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).[456] Much of the public radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR, incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967.[457]  U.S. newspapers with a global reach and reputation include The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and USA Today.[458] About 800 publications are produced in Spanish.[459][460] With few exceptions, newspapers are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or, in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have alternative newspapers to complement the mainstream daily papers, such as The Village Voice in New York City and LA Weekly in Los Angeles. The five most popular websites used in the U.S. are Google, YouTube, Amazon, Yahoo, and Facebook, with all of them being American companies.[461]  As of 2022[update], the video game market of the United States is the world's largest by revenue.[462] There are 444 publishers, developers, and hardware companies in California alone.[463]  The United States is well known for its cinema and theater. Mainstream theater in the United States derives from the old European theatrical tradition and has been heavily influenced by the British theater.[464] By the middle of the 19th century America had created new distinct dramatic forms in the Tom Shows, the showboat theater and the minstrel show.[465] The central hub of the American theater scene is Manhattan, with its divisions of Broadway, off-Broadway, and off-off-Broadway.[466]  Many movie and television stars have gotten their big break working in New York productions. Outside New York City, many cities have professional regional or resident theater companies that produce their own seasons. The biggest-budget theatrical productions are musicals. U.S. theater has an active community theater culture.[467]  The Tony Awards recognizes excellence in live Broadway theatre and are presented at an annual ceremony in Manhattan. The awards are given for Broadway productions and performances. One is also given for regional theatre. Several discretionary non-competitive awards are given as well, including a Special Tony Award, the Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre, and the Isabelle Stevenson Award.[468]  In the visual arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European naturalism. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.[470]  Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new and individualistic styles, which would become known as American modernism. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. Major photographers include Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, Dorothea Lange, Edward Weston, James Van Der Zee, Ansel Adams, and Gordon Parks.[471]  The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought global fame to American architects, including Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry.[472] The Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan is the largest art museum in the United States.[473]  American folk music encompasses numerous music genres, variously known as traditional music, traditional folk music, contemporary folk music, or roots music. Many traditional songs have been sung within the same family or folk group for generations, and sometimes trace back to such origins as the British Isles, Mainland Europe, or Africa.[474] The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music in particular have influenced American music.[475] Banjos were brought to America through the slave trade. Minstrel shows incorporating the instrument into their acts led to its increased popularity and widespread production in the 19th century.[476][477] The electric guitar, first invented in the 1930s, and mass-produced by the 1940s, had an enormous influence on popular music, in particular due to the development of rock and roll.[478]  Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz grew from blues and ragtime in the early 20th century, developing from the innovations and recordings of composers such as W.C. Handy and Jelly Roll Morton. Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington increased its popularity early in the 20th century.[479] Country music developed in the 1920s,[480] rock and roll in the 1930s,[478] and bluegrass[481] and rhythm and blues in the 1940s.[482] In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of the country's most celebrated songwriters.[483] The musical forms of punk and hip hop both originated in the United States in the 1970s.[484]  The United States has the world's largest music market with a total retail value of $15.9 billion in 2022.[485] Most of the world's major record companies are based in the U.S.; they are represented by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[486] Mid-20th-century American pop stars, such as Frank Sinatra[487] and Elvis Presley,[488] became global celebrities and best-selling music artists,[479] as have artists of the late 20th century, such as Michael Jackson,[489] Madonna,[490] Whitney Houston,[491] and Prince,[492] and of early 21st century such as Taylor Swift and Beyonc\u00e9.[493]  The United States and China collectively account for the majority of global apparel demand. Apart from professional business attire, American fashion is eclectic and predominantly informal. While Americans' diverse cultural roots are reflected in their clothing, sneakers, jeans, T-shirts, and baseball caps are emblematic of American styles.[494] New York is considered to be one of the \"big four\" global fashion capitals, along with Paris, Milan, and London. A study demonstrated that general proximity to Manhattan's Garment District has been synonymous with American fashion since its inception in the early 20th century.[495]  The headquarters of many designer labels reside in Manhattan. Labels cater to niche markets, such as pre teens. There has been a trend in the United States fashion towards sustainable clothing.[496] New York Fashion Week is one of the most influential fashion weeks in the world, and occurs twice a year.[497]  The U.S. film industry has a worldwide influence and following. Hollywood, a district in northern Los Angeles, the nation's second-most populous city, is also metonymous for the American filmmaking industry, the third-largest in the world, following India and Nigeria.[498][499][500] The major film studios of the United States are the primary source of the most commercially successful and most ticket-selling movies in the world.[501][502] Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization.[503] The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929,[504] and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since January 1944.[505]  The industry enjoyed its golden years, in what is commonly referred to as the \"Golden Age of Hollywood\", from the early sound period until the early 1960s,[506] with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures.[507][508] In the 1970s, \"New Hollywood\" or the \"Hollywood Renaissance\"[509] was defined by grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period.[510] The 21st century was marked by the rise of American streaming platforms, which came to rival traditional cinema.[511][512]  Early settlers were introduced by Native Americans to foods such as turkey, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup. Of the most enduring and pervasive examples are variations of the native dish called succotash. Early settlers and later immigrants combined these with foods they were familiar with, such as wheat flour,[513] beef, and milk to create a distinctive American cuisine.[514][515] New World crops, especially pumpkin, corn, potatoes, and turkey as the main course are part of a shared national menu on Thanksgiving, when many Americans prepare or purchase traditional dishes to celebrate the occasion.[516]  Characteristic American dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, doughnuts, french fries, macaroni and cheese, ice cream, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrant groups.[517][518][519][520] Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos preexisted the United States in areas later annexed from Mexico, and adaptations of Chinese cuisine as well as pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are all widely consumed.[521] American chefs have had a significant impact on society both domestically and internationally. In 1946, the Culinary Institute of America was founded by Katharine Angell and Frances Roth. This would become the United States' most prestigious culinary school, where many of the most talented American chefs would study prior to successful careers.[522][523]  The United States restaurant industry was projected at $899 billion in sales for 2020,[524][525] and employed more than 15 million people, representing 10% of the nation's workforce directly.[524] It is the country's second-largest private employer and the third-largest employer overall.[526][527] The United States is home to over 220 Michelin Star rated restaurants, 70 of which are in New York City alone.[528] Wine has been produced in what is now the United States since the 1500s, with the first widespread production beginning in what is now New Mexico in 1628.[529][530][531] Today, wine production is undertaken in all fifty states, with California producing 84 percent of all US wine. With more than 1,100,000 acres (4,500\u00a0km2) under vine, the United States is the fourth-largest wine producing country in the world, after Italy, Spain, and France.[532][533]  The American fast-food industry, the world's first and largest, pioneered the drive-through format in the 1940s[534] and is often viewed as being a symbol of U.S. marketing dominance. American companies such as McDonald's,[535] Burger King, Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Domino's Pizza, among many others, have numerous outlets around the world.[536]  The most popular spectator sports in the U.S. are American football, basketball, baseball, soccer, and ice hockey.[537] While most major U.S. sports such as baseball and American football have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, many of which have become popular worldwide.[538] Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate European contact.[539] The market for professional sports in the United States was approximately $69\u00a0billion in July 2013, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.[540]  American football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport in the United States;[541] the National Football League has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by tens of millions globally.[542] However, baseball has been regarded as the U.S. \"national sport\" since the late 19th century. After American football, the next four most popular professional team sports are basketball, baseball, soccer, and ice hockey. Their premier leagues are, respectively, the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer, and the National Hockey League. The most-watched individual sports in the U.S. are golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR and IndyCar.[543][544]  On the collegiate level, earnings for the member institutions exceed $1 billion annually,[545] and college football and basketball attract large audiences, as the NCAA March Madness tournament and the College Football Playoff are some of the most watched national sporting events.[546] In the U.S., the intercollegiate sports level serves as a feeder system for professional sports. This differs greatly from practices in nearly all other countries, where publicly and privately funded sports organizations serve this function.[547]  Eight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States. The 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, were the first-ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.[548] The Olympic Games will be held in the U.S. for a ninth time when Los Angeles hosts the 2028 Summer Olympics. U.S. athletes have won a total of 2,959 medals (1,173 gold) at the Olympic Games, the most of any country.[549][550][551]  In international competition, the U.S. men's national soccer team has qualified for eleven World Cups, while the women's national team has won the FIFA Women's World Cup and Olympic soccer tournament four times each.[552] The United States hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup and will co-host, along with Canada and Mexico, the 2026 FIFA World Cup.[553] The 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup was also hosted by the United States. Its final match was watched by 90,185, setting the world record for most-attended women's sporting event.[554]    40\u00b0N 100\u00b0W\ufeff \/ \ufeff40\u00b0N 100\u00b0W\ufeff \/ 40; -100\ufeff (United States of America) "},{"title":"Football pitch","content":"  A football pitch (also known as a soccer field in the United States)[1] is the playing surface for the game of association football. Its dimensions and markings are defined by Law 1 of the Laws of the Game, \"The Field of Play\".[2] The pitch is typically made of natural turf or artificial turf, although amateur and recreational teams often play on dirt fields. Artificial surfaces are allowed only to be green in colour.[2]  All line markings on the pitch form part of the area which they define. For example, a ball on or above the touchline is still on the field of play, and a foul committed over the line bounding the penalty area results in a penalty. Therefore, a ball has to completely cross the touchline to be out of play, and a ball has to fully cross the goal line (between the goal posts) in order for a goal to be scored; if any part of the ball is still on or above the line, a goal is not scored and the ball is still in play.[3]  The field descriptions that apply to adult matches are described below. Because of the role of the British football associations in the history of the game, the dimensions of the field of play were originally formulated and expressed in imperial units.  Since 1999, the Laws of the Game have preferred metric units, with imperial equivalents given only in brackets.  Because the actual values have, in general, not changed since the early twentieth century, they tend to be round numbers in imperial units (for example the width of the goal, unchanged since 1863, is 8 yards (7.32 metres)). Use of the imperial values remains common, especially in the United Kingdom.[citation needed]  The pitch is rectangular in shape. The shorter sides are called goal lines and the longer sides are called the touchlines. The two goal lines are between 50 and 100 yards (46 and 91 metres) wide and have to be of the same length.[4] The two touchlines are between 100 and 130 yards (91 and 119 metres) long and have to be of the same length.[4] All lines on the ground are equally wide, not to exceed 12 centimetres (5 inches).[4] The corners of the pitch are marked by corner flags.[5]  For international matches the field dimensions are more tightly constrained; the goal lines are between 70 and 80 yards (64 and 75 metres) wide and the touchlines are between 110 and 120 yards (100 and 110 metres) long.[4] The majority of top-level professional football pitches, including those belonging to teams in the English Premier League, measure 112 to 115 yards (102.4 to 105.2 metres) long and 70 to 75 yards (64.0 to 68.6 metres) wide.[6]  Although the term goal line is often taken to mean only that part of the line between the goalposts, in fact it refers to the complete line at either end of the pitch, from one corner flag to the other. In contrast the term byline (or by-line) is often used to refer to that portion of the goal line outside the goalposts. This term is commonly used in football commentaries and match descriptions.[7]  Goals are placed at the centre of each goal-line.[8] These consist of two upright posts placed equidistant from the corner flagposts, joined at the top by a horizontal crossbar. The inner edges of the posts are regulated to be 8 yards (7.32 metres) (wide) apart, and the lower edge of the crossbar is elevated to 8 feet (2.44 metres) above the pitch. As a result, the area that players shoot at is 192 square feet (17.84 square metres).[9] Nets are usually placed behind the goal, though are not required by the Laws.[citation needed]  Goalposts and crossbars have to be white and made of wood, metal or other approved material. Rules regarding the shape of goalposts and crossbars are somewhat more lenient, but they have to conform to a shape that does not pose a threat to players. Despite this, injuries due to goalpost collisions are still quite common, and not much research goes into this aspect of player safety.[citation needed]  Recent developments in material science, however, have shown that there are a variety of materials that can be used to coat goalposts to reduce impact on players, hence improving safety. The majority of these materials come from various mixtures of polymers with desirable properties. An example of this would be a mixture made of 63% by weight of methyl methacrylate, 32% by weight of polyethylene glycol, crosslinked with 5% by weight of ethylene glycol dimethacrylate. This has up to a 99% shape recovery rate with very heavy impacts (such as that of a high speed player hitting the post), and deform significantly enough so as to reduce the impact on the player. This significantly improves player safety, while sacrificing very little in terms of function of the goal post.[citation needed]  A goal is scored when the ball fully crosses the goal line between the goal-posts and beneath the crossbar, even if a defending player last touched the ball before it crossed the goal line (see own goal). A goal may, however, be ruled illegal (and void by the referee) if the player who scored or a member of their team commits an offence under any of the laws between the time the ball was previously out of play and the goal being scored. It is also deemed void if a player on the opposing team commits an offence before the ball has passed the line, as in the case of fouls being committed, a penalty awarded but the ball continued on a path that caused it to cross the goal line.[citation needed]  The football goal size for a junior match goal is approximately half the size of an adult sized match goal.[10]  Football goals were first described in England in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. In 1584 and 1602 respectively, John Norden and Richard Carew referred to \"goals\" in Cornish hurling. Carew described how goals were made: \"they pitch two bushes in the ground, some eight or ten foote asunder; and directly against them, ten or twelue [twelve] score off, other twayne in like distance, which they terme their Goales\".[11] The first reference to scoring a goal is in John Day's play The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green (performed circa 1600; published 1659). Similarly in a poem in 1613, Michael Drayton refers to \"when the Ball to throw, And drive it to the Gole, in squadrons forth they goe\". Solid crossbars were first introduced by the Sheffield Rules. Football nets were invented by Liverpool engineer John Brodie in 1891,[12] and they were a necessary help for discussions about whether or not a goal had been scored.[13]  Two rectangular boxes are marked out on the pitch in front of each goal.[4]  The goal area (colloquially the \"six-yard box\"), consists of the rectangle formed by the goal-line, two lines starting on the goal-line 6 yards (5.49 metres) from the goalposts and extending 6 yards (5.49 metres) into the pitch from the goal-line, and the line joining these, i.e. they are a rectangle 6 yards (5.49 metres) by 20 yards (18.29 metres). Goal kicks and any free kick by the defending team may be taken from anywhere in this area. FIFA's laws of the game stipulates that: \"All free kicks are taken from the place where the offence occurred, except: indirect free kicks to the attacking team for an offence inside the opponents' goal area are taken from the nearest point on the goal area line which runs parallel to the goal line, and free kicks to the defending team in their goal area may be taken from anywhere in that area.\"[14]  The penalty area (colloquially \"the 18-yard box\" or just \"the box\") is similarly formed by the goal-line and lines extending from it, but its lines start 18 yards (16.46 metres) from the goalposts and extend 18 yards (16.46 metres) into the field. i.e. this is a rectangle 44 yards (40.23 metres) by 18 yards (16.46 metres).  This area has a number of functions, the most prominent being to denote where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a foul by a defender, usually punished by a direct free kick, becomes punishable by a penalty kick. Both the goal and penalty areas were formed as semicircles until 1902.[13]  The penalty mark (colloquially \"the penalty spot\" or just \"the spot\") is 12 yards (10.97 metres) in front of the very centre of the goal: this is the point from where penalty kicks are taken.[citation needed]  The penalty arc (colloquially \"the D\") is marked from the outside edge of the penalty area, 10 yards (9.14 metres) from the penalty mark; this, along with the penalty area, marks an exclusion zone for all players other than the penalty kicker and defending goalkeeper during a penalty kick.[15]  The centre circle is marked at 10 yards (9.14 metres) from the centre mark. Similar to the penalty arc, this indicates the minimum distance that opposing players have to keep at kick-off; the ball itself is placed on the centre mark.[13] During penalty shootouts all players other than the two goalkeepers and the current kicker are required to remain within this circle.[citation needed]  The half-way line divides the pitch in two. The half which a team defends is commonly referred to as being their half. Players have to be located within their own half at a kick-off and may not be penalised as being offside in their own half. The intersections between the half-way line and the touchline can be indicated with flags like those marking the corners \u2013 the laws consider this as an optional feature.[5]  The arcs in the corners denote the area (within 1 yard (0.91 metres) of the corner) in which the ball has to be placed for corner kicks; opposition players have to be 10 yards (9.14 metres) away during a corner, and there may be optional lines off-pitch 10 yards (9.14 metres) away from the corner arc on the goal- and touch-lines to help gauge these distances.[8]  Grass is the normal surface of play, although artificial turf may sometimes be used especially in locations where maintenance of grass may be difficult due to inclement weather. This may include areas where it is very wet, causing the grass to deteriorate rapidly; where it is very dry, causing the grass to die; and where the turf is under heavy use. Artificial turf pitches are also increasingly common in the Nordic countries, due to the amount of snow during the winter months. The strain put on grass pitches by the cold climate and subsequent snow clearing has necessitated the installation of artificial turf in the stadia of many top-tier clubs in Norway, Sweden and Finland. The latest artificial surfaces use rubber crumbs, as opposed to the previous system of sand infill. Some leagues and football associations have specifically prohibited artificial surfaces due to injury concerns and require teams' home stadia to have grass pitches. All artificial turf has to be green and also meet the requirements specified in the FIFA Quality Concept for Football Turf.[16][17][18]  Football can also be played on a dirt or gravel field. In most parts of the world dirt is used only for casual recreational play.[citation needed]  In the winter the pitch may be used for bandy (similar to ice hockey) by being filled with water which is allowed to freeze.[citation needed] "},{"title":"Sport of athletics","content":"  Athletics is a group of sporting events that involves competitive running, jumping, throwing, and walking.[1] The most common types of athletics competitions are track and field, road running, cross-country running, and racewalking.  The results of racing events are decided by finishing position (or time, where measured), while the jumps and throws are won by the athlete that achieves the highest or furthest measurement from a series of attempts. The simplicity of the competitions, and the lack of a need for expensive equipment, makes athletics one of the most common types of sports in the world. Athletics is mostly an individual sport, with the exception of relay races and competitions which combine athletes' performances for a team score, such as cross country.  Organized athletics are traced back to the Ancient Olympic Games from 776\u00a0BC. The rules and format of the modern events in athletics were defined in Western Europe and North America in the 19th and early 20th century, and were then spread to other parts of the world. Most modern top level meetings are held under the auspices of World Athletics, the global governing body for the sport of athletics, or its member continental and national federations.  The athletics meeting forms the backbone of the Summer Olympics. The foremost international athletics meeting is the World Athletics Championships, which incorporates track and field, marathon running and race walking. Other top level competitions in athletics include the World Athletics Cross Country Championships and the World Athletics Road Running Championships. Athletes with a physical disability compete at the Summer Paralympics and the World Para Athletics Championships.  The word athletics is derived from the Ancient Greek \u1f00\u03b8\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 (athl\u0113t\u0113s, \"combatant in public games\") from \u1f06\u03b8\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd (athlon, \"prize\") or \u1f06\u03b8\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 (athlos, \"competition\").[2] Initially, the term described athletic contests in general \u2013 i.e. sporting competition based primarily on human physical feats. In the 19th century, the term athletics acquired a more narrow definition in Europe and came to describe sports involving competitive running, walking, jumping and throwing. This definition continues to be prominent in the United Kingdom and the former British Empire.  Related words in Germanic and Romance languages also have a similar meaning.  In much of North America, athletics is synonymous with sports in general, maintaining the historical usage of the term. The word \"athletics\" is rarely used to refer to the sport of athletics in this region. Track and field is preferred, and is used in the United States and Canada to refer to athletics events, including race-walking and marathon running (although cross country running is typically considered a separate sport).  Athletic contests in running, walking, jumping and throwing are among the oldest of all sports and their roots are prehistoric.[3] Athletics events were depicted in the Ancient Egyptian tombs in Saqqara, with illustrations of running at the Heb Sed festival and high jumping  appearing in tombs from as early as of 2250\u00a0BC.[4] The Tailteann Games were an ancient Celtic festival in Ireland, founded c.\u20091800\u00a0BC, and the thirty-day meeting included running and stone-throwing among its sporting events.[5] The original and only event at the first Olympics in 776\u00a0BC was a stadium-length running event  known as the stadion. This later expanded to include throwing and jumping events within the ancient pentathlon. Athletics competitions also took place at other Panhellenic Games, which were founded later around 500\u00a0BC.[6]  The Cotswold Olympic Games, a sports festival which emerged in 17th century England, featured athletics in the form of sledgehammer throwing contests.[7] Annually, from 1796 to 1798, L'Olympiade de la R\u00e9publique was held in revolutionary France, and is an early forerunner to the modern Olympic Games. The premier event of this competition was a running event, but various ancient Greek disciplines were also on display. The 1796 Olympiade marked the introduction of the metric system into the sport.[8]  Athletics competitions were held about 1812 at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst,[9] and in 1840 in Shrewsbury, Shropshire at the Royal Shrewsbury School Hunt. The Royal Military Academy at Woolwich held an organised competition in 1849, and a regular series of closed meetings open only to undergraduates, was held by Exeter College, Oxford, from 1850.[10] The annual Wenlock Olympian Games, first held in 1850 in Wenlock, England, incorporated athletics events into its sports programme.[11]  The first modern-style indoor athletics meetings were recorded shortly after in the 1860s, including a meet at Ashburnham Hall in London which featured four running events and a triple jump competition.[12][13]  The Amateur Athletic Association (AAA) was established in England in 1880 as the first national body for the sport of athletics and began holding its own annual athletics competition \u2013 the AAA Championships. The United States also began holding an annual national competition \u2013 the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships \u2013 first held in 1876 by the New York Athletic Club.[14] Athletics became codified and standardized via the English AAA and other general sports organisations in the late 19th century, such as the Amateur Athletic Union (founded in the US in 1888) and the Union des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s fran\u00e7aises de sports athl\u00e9tiques (founded in France in 1889).  An athletics competition was included in the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 and it has been as one of the foremost competitions at the quadrennial multi-sport event ever since. Originally for men only, the 1928 Olympics saw the introduction of women's events in the athletics programme. Athletics is part of the Paralympic Games since the inaugural Games in 1960. Athletics has a very high-profile during major championships, especially the Olympics, but otherwise is less popular.  An international governing body, the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF), was founded in 1912. It enforced amateur sport status on competitions during much of the 20th century. Professional competition continued at a low level, becoming increasingly more common as the century progressed. The International Track Association briefly formed a professional track and field circuit in the United States in the 1970s. Athletes used their increasing status to push for remuneration and the IAAF responded with the IAAF Golden Events series and the establishment an outdoor World Championships in 1983, including track and field, racewalking and a marathon event. In modern times, athletes can receive money for racing, putting an end to the so-called \"amateurism\" that existed before. The global body updated the name to the International Association of Athletics Federations in 2001, moving away from its amateur origins,[15] before taking on its current name World Athletics in 2019.[16]  The Comit\u00e9 International Sports des Sourds had been formed by 1922, to govern international deaf sports, including athletics.[17]  The first organized international competitions for athletes with a physical disability (not deaf) began in 1952, when the first international Stoke Mandeville Games were organized for World War II veterans.[17][18] This only included athletes in a wheelchair. This inspired the first Paralympic Games, held in 1960. Competitions would over time be expanded to include mainly athletes with amputation, cerebral palsy and visual impairment, in addition to wheelchair events.  World Athletics, the sport's governing body, defines athletics in six disciplines: track and field, road running, race walking, cross country running, mountain running, and trail running.[19] Mountain running was added in 2003 and trail running was added in 2015.[20][21][22][23]  All forms of athletics are individual sports with the exception of relay races. However, athletes' performances are often tallied together by country at international championships, and, in the case of cross country and road races, finishing positions or times of the top athletes from a team may be combined to declare a team victor.  Several further forms of competitive running exist outside of the governance of World Athletics. The International Skyrunning Federation (ISF) governs high-altitude mountain running, defined as skyrunning, and is affiliated with the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation rather than World Athletics.[24] Competitive stair climbing events, usually hosted in skyscrapers, has two common names: vertical running (as described by the ISF) and tower running (as described by the Towerrunning World Association).[25][26] Snowshoe running is a winter sport governed by the World Snowshoe Federation, which is similarly to cross country running but has athletes wearing snowshoes to race over deep snow on an obstacle-free course.[27] The International Association of Ultrarunners organises ultra running as an affiliate of World Athletics, but these long-distance forms of competition fit within World Athletics disciplines, albeit with additional distance.[28]  Track and field competitions emerged in the late 19th century and were typically contested between athletes who were representing rival educational institutions, military organisations and sports clubs.[29] Participating athletes may compete in one or more events, according to their specialities. Men and women compete separately. Track and field comes in both indoor and outdoor formats, with most indoor competitions occurring in winter, while outdoor events are mostly held in summer. The sport is defined by the venue in which the competitions are held \u2013 the athletics stadium.  A variety of running events are held on the track which fall into three broad distance categories: sprints, middle-distance, and long-distance track events. Relay races feature teams comprising four runners each, who must pass a baton to their teammate after a specified distance with the aim of being the first team to finish. Hurdling events and the steeplechase are a variation upon the flat running theme in that athletes must clear obstacles on the track during the race. The field events come in two types \u2013 jumping and throwing competitions. In throwing events, athletes are measured by how far they hurl an implement, with the common events being the shot put, discus, javelin, and hammer throw. There are four common jumping events: the long jump and triple jump are contests measuring the horizontal distance an athlete can jump, while the high jump and pole vault are decided on the height achieved. Combined events, which include the decathlon (typically competed by men) and heptathlon (typically competed by women), are competitions where athletes compete in a number of different track and field events, with each performance going toward a final points tally.  The most prestigious track and field contests occur within athletics championships and athletics programmes at multi-sport events. The Olympic athletics competition and World Championships in Athletics, and the Paralympic athletics competition and World Para Athletics Championships, are the highest and most prestigious levels of competition in track and field. Track and field events have become the most prominent part of major athletics championships and many famous athletes within the sport of athletics come from this discipline. Discrete track and field competitions are found at national championships-level and also at annual, invitational track and field meets. Meetings range from elite competitions\u00a0\u2013 such as those in the IAAF Diamond League series\u00a0\u2013 to basic all comers track meets, inter-sports club meetings and schools events, which form the grassroots of track and field.    Road running competitions are running events (predominantly long distance) which are mainly conducted on courses of paved or tarmac roads, although major events often finish on the track of a main stadium. In addition to being a common recreational sport, the elite level of the sport\u00a0\u2013 particularly marathon races\u00a0\u2013 are one of the most popular aspects of athletics. Road racing events can be of virtually any distance, but the most common and well known are the marathon, half marathon, 10\u00a0km and 5\u00a0km. The marathon is the only road running event featured at the IAAF World Championships in Athletics and the Summer Olympics, although there is also an annual IAAF World Half Marathon Championships. The marathon is also the only road running event featured at the World Para Athletics Championships and the Summer Paralympics. The World Marathon Majors series includes the six most prestigious marathon competitions at the elite level\u00a0\u2013 the Berlin, Boston, Chicago, London, New York City and Tokyo Marathons.  The sport of road running finds its roots in the activities of footmen: male servants who ran alongside the carriages of aristocrats around the 18th century, and who also ran errands over distances for their masters. Foot racing competitions evolved from wagers between aristocrats, who pitted their footman against that of another aristocrat in order to determine a winner. The sport became professionalised as footmen were hired specifically on their athletic ability and began to devote their lives to training for the gambling events. The amateur sports movement in the late 19th century marginalised competitions based on the professional, gambling model. The 1896 Summer Olympics saw the birth of the modern marathon and the event led to the growth of road running competitions through annual events such as the Boston Marathon (first held in 1897) and the Lake Biwa Marathon and Fukuoka Marathons, which were established in the 1940s. The 1970s running boom in the United States made road running a common pastime and also increased its popularity at the elite level.[30]  Ekiden contests\u00a0\u2013 which originated in Japan and remain very popular there\u00a0\u2013 are a relay race variation on the marathon, being in contrast to the typically individual sport of road running.  Cross country running is the most naturalistic of the sports in athletics as competitions take place on open-air courses over surfaces such as grass, woodland trails, and earth. It is both an individual and team sport, as runners are judged on an individual basis and a points scoring method is used for teams. Competitions are typically long distance races of 3\u00a0km (1.9\u00a0mi) or more which are usually held in autumn and winter. Cross country's most successful athletes often compete in long-distance track and road events as well.  The Crick Run in England in 1838 was the first recorded instance of an organised cross country competition. The sport gained popularity in British, then American schools in the 19th century and culminated in the creation of the first International Cross Country Championships in 1903.[31] The annual IAAF World Cross Country Championships was inaugurated in 1973 and this remains the highest level of competition for the sport. A number of continental cross country competitions are held, with championships taking place in Asia, Europe, North America and South America. The sport has retained its status at the scholastic level, particularly in the United Kingdom and United States. At the professional level, the foremost competitions come under the banner of the IAAF Cross Country Permit Meetings.  While cross country competitions are no longer held at the Olympics, having featured in the athletics programme from 1912 to 1924, it has been present as one of the events within the modern pentathlon competition since the 1912 Summer Olympics. One variation on traditional cross country is mountain running, which incorporates significant uphill and\/or downhill sections as an additional challenge to the course. Fell running and Orienteering are other competitive sports similar to cross country, although they feature an element of navigation which is absent from the set courses of cross country.  Racewalking is a form of competitive walking that usually takes place on open-air roads, although running tracks are also occasionally used. Racewalking is the only sport in athletics in which judges monitor athletes on their technique. Racewalkers must always have a foot in contact with the ground and their advancing leg must be straightened, not bent at the knee\u00a0\u2013 failure to follow these rules results in disqualification from the race.[32]  Racewalking finds its roots in the sport of pedestrianism which emerged in the late 18th century in England. Spectators would gamble on the outcome of the walking competitions. The sport took on an endurance aspect and competitions were held over long distances or walkers would have to achieve a certain distance within a specified time frame, such as Centurion contests of walking 100 miles (160\u00a0km) within 24 hours.[32] During this period, racewalking was frequently held on athletics tracks for ease of measurement, and the 1908 Summer Olympics in London saw the introduction of the 3500-metre and 10-mile walks. Racewalking was briefly dropped from the Olympic programme in 1928, but the men's 50 kilometres race walk has been held at every Olympic Games but one since 1932. The men's 20 kilometres race walk was added to the Olympic athletics schedule in 1956 and the women's event was first held in 1992. The most common events in modern competition are over 10\u00a0km, 20\u00a0km and 50\u00a0km on roads, although women's 3\u00a0km and men's 5\u00a0km are held on indoor tracks.  The highest level racewalking competitions occur at the IAAF World Championships in Athletics and at the Summer Olympics, although the sport also has its own separate major competition\u00a0\u2013 the IAAF World Race Walking Cup\u00a0\u2013 which has been held since 1961. The IAAF World Race Walking Challenge forms the primary seasonal competition \u2013 athletes earn points for their performances at ten selected racewalking competitions and the highest scoring walkers are entered into that year's IAAF Race Walking Challenge Final.  The significant variation in people's abilities in the sport of athletics has led to the creation of numerous competitive categories, in order that athletes are pitted against rivals of a similar kind or ability, and to include groups of people who would otherwise not be competitive in open-to-all events. The eligibility of athletes for a given category is occasionally a source of controversy among the sport's participants, officials and spectators, with disputes typically being rooted in deliberate cheating in order to gain a competitive advantage or differing cultural perspectives over the eligibility of a category.  Beyond the primary categories based on physical attributes, some competitions have further eligibility criteria based on nationality, community membership or occupation.  The foremost division of this kind is by sex[ling]: in athletics, men and women almost exclusively compete against people of the same sex. In contrast to the men's division, the development of the women's division has caused regular dispute in terms of eligibility. Several intersex athletes had success in the women's division in the early 20th century, such as Stanis\u0142awa Walasiewicz and Mary Weston (later Mark), and the IAAF responded by introducing sex verification for all athletes in the women's category, beginning with the disqualification of sprinter Foekje Dillema in 1950 after she refused to be tested.[33] Olympic champion Ewa K\u0142obukowska became the first athlete to publicly fail the test in 1967 and the humiliation she suffered as a result of the announcement led to sex tests becoming a confidential process.[34] Hurdler Maria Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez-Pati\u00f1o failed a test and was disqualified in 1985, but publicly fought the ban in court and was reinstated in 1988. In 1991, the IAAF replaced the sex chromatin test with general medical tests for athletes of all divisions, due to changes in ethical and scientific viewpoints.[35]  The question of eligibility for the women's division continued to be a contentious and public issue into the 21st century, with Caster Semenya and Dutee Chand bearing periods of ineligibility and taking the IAAF to the Court of Arbitration for Sport over their bans under the hyperandrogenism rules.[36] An increasing number of trans men and trans women began to compete in the women's division in the 2010s, which caused other athletes in the division to raise questions of fairness in competition.[37][38]  The dispute reached new heights in 2019 with the United Nations Human Rights Council issuing a statement that the IAAF was breaching \"international human rights norms and standards\" through its practice of allowing some athletes to compete in the women's division only once they had lowered their testosterone levels through medical intervention.[39] The IAAF and several prominent women athletes, such as Paula Radcliffe, said this was required in order to prevent a situation where countries deliberately sought out athletes who were intersex, transgender or had a difference in sex development in order to succeed in women's sport.[40] Others have argued for the abolition of gender verification testing, with academic Maren Behrensen citing the harm to tested athletes' social and emotional well-being, the inaccuracy of the medical tests, the difficulty of determining the exact performance advantage provided by a given condition, and the moral risk of \"gender-engineering\" by setting a biological definition for a female athlete.[41]  Age is a significant determiner of ability to compete in athletics, with athletic ability generally increasing through childhood and adolescence, peaking in early adulthood, then gradually declining from around the age of 30 onwards.[42][43] As a result, numerous age categories have been created to encourage younger and older athletes to engage in competition. At international level, there are three major categories for young athletes: under-23, under-20 (formerly junior), and under-18 (formerly youth). Beyond international rules, different youth categories are in use in the sport, often in the form of two-year or single age groupings.[44] Age categories are more extensive for older athletes and these are commonly organised under the umbrella of masters athletics, which has age groups spanning five years for all athletes aged 35 and above. There is no limit to the number of age groupings, hence Stanis\u0142aw Kowalski holds a world record for men aged 105 years and over.[45] For competitions where age is not taken into account, this is known as senior or open class athletics; in international rules there remain some restrictions on younger people competing in endurance events for health reasons .[44]  Athletes' eligibility for a competitive age grouping is typically assessed through official documentation, such as birth records or passports. Instances of age cheating have occurred at all of the IAAF's global age category championships. One prominent incident was Olympic medalist Thomas Longosiwa, who provided a falsified passport to compete at the 2006 World Junior Championships in Athletics at age 24.[46] Age falsification for youth categories is mostly limited to less developed parts of the world, such as Africa and South Asia, which have less stringent controls on official documentation and many mature athletes engaging in high school competition due to disruptions to education.[47][48][49][50] The same regions of the world also present issues with age verification in masters age categories, with examples such as Indian distance runners Dharampal Singh Gudha and Fauja Singh (both claiming to be over 100 years old) reaching mainstream attention.[51]  Athletes with physical disabilities have competed at separate international events since 1952. The International Paralympic Committee governs the competitions in athletics, and hosts the Paralympic Games, which have continued since 1960.[17][18]  Competitors at elite level competitions, are classified by disability, to arrange athletes with a similar disability in the same event. A classified T12 athlete for example, is a track athlete with a visual impairment.[52]  Operating independently of the Paralympic movement, deaf athletes have a long-established tradition of organised athletics, with the first major world competition being included at the 1924 Deaflympics.[53] The primary impediments to the inclusion of deaf athletes in mainstream athletics are sound based elements of the sport, such as the starter's pistol. This can be a disadvantage even in Paralympic sport, as shown in by the example of Olivia Breen who failed to hear a false start in a cerebral palsy class race at the 2012 Paralympics.[54]  In wheelchair racing athletes compete in lightweight racing chairs.  Most major marathons have wheelchair divisions and the elite racers consistently beat the runners on foot. The speed of wheel chair racers has caused difficulties for race organisers in properly staggering their start times compared to runners. A collision between Josh Cassidy (a wheelchair racer) and Tiki Gelana (a leading female marathoner) at the 2013 London Marathon brought the issue into the spotlight again.[55]  Occasionally, athletes with a disability reach a level at which they can compete against able-bodied athletes.  Legally blind Marla Runyan ran in the 2000 and 2004 Olympics and won a gold medal in the 1500 metres at the 1999 Pan American Games.  Oscar Pistorius, a double amputee, was a semi-finalist at the 2011 World Championships and won a silver medal as part of South Africa's 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay team.[56] In masters athletics it is far more common to make an accommodation for athletes with a disability.  Blind Ivy Granstrom set numerous Masters world records while being guided around the track.[57]  The disability categories have caused dispute among athletes, with some athletes being accused of exaggerating their level of disability in order to compete in less challenging categories.[58] Athletes with intellectual disabilities were banned from competition in all Paralymic sports in response to verification issues and cheating at the 2000 Summer Paralympics and the intellectual disability athletics programme was only restored twelve years later at the 2012 Summer Paralympics.[59]  Professional athletics almost exclusively takes place in one of three types of venue: stadiums, set courses on grass or woodland, and road-based courses. Such venues ensure that events take place in a relatively standardised manner, as well as improving the safety of athletes and enjoyment for spectators. At a more basic level, many forms of athletics demand very little in terms of venue requirements; almost any open space or area of field can provide a suitable venue for basic running, jumping and throwing competitions.  A standard outdoor track is in the shape of a stadium,[60] 400 metres in length, and has at least eight lanes 1.22\u00a0m in width (small arenas might have six lanes). Older track facilities may have nonstandard track lengths, such as 440 yards (402.3\u00a0m; 1\/4 mile) (common in the United States). Historically, tracks were covered by a dirt running surface. Modern All-weather running tracks are covered by a synthetic weather-resistant running surface, which typically consists of rubber (either black SBR or colored EPDM granules), bound by polyurethane or latex resins. Older tracks may be cinder-covered. The facilities can be called track and field stadiums or athletics stadiums.[61][62]  A standard indoor track is designed similarly to an outdoor track, but is only 200 metres in length and has between four and eight lanes, each with width between 0.90\u00a0m and 1.10\u00a0m.[63] Often, the bends of an indoor track will be banked to compensate for the small turning radius. However, because of space limitations, indoor tracks may have other nonstandard lengths, such as 160-yard (146.3\u00a0m) indoor track at Madison Square Garden used for the Millrose Games. Because of space limitations, meetings held at indoor facilities do not hold many of athletics events typically contested outdoors.  There is no standardised form of cross country course and each venue is significantly defined by the environment it contains \u2013 some may be relatively flat and featureless, while others may be more challenging with natural obstacles, tight turns, and undulating ground. While a small number of purpose-built courses exist, the vast majority of cross country running courses are created by cordoning a specific area within any open natural land, typically a park, woodland or greenspace near a settlement.[64]  At the elite and professional level, courses must be looped and each lap must be between 1750\u00a0m and 2000\u00a0m in length. Severe obstacles such as deep ditches, high barriers and thick undergrowth not normally present; the course should be able to be completed whilst remaining on foot throughout. In order to maintain the sport's distinction from road running, the usage of unnatural or macadamised surfaces is generally kept to a minimum or avoided entirely.[64]  Because the majority of races take place on areas of grass, soil, mud or earth, weather conditions can significantly affect the difficulty of cross country courses, as snow and rain reduces traction and can create areas of standing water.  The surface of road races is highly important and the IAAF dictate that the courses must be along man-made roads, bicycle paths or footpaths. Courses set along major roads of cities are typical of road running events, and traffic is usually cordoned off from the area during the competition. While soft ground, such as grass, is generally avoided, races may start and finish on soft ground or within an athletics stadium. Road racing courses come in two primary types: looped and point-to-point. Courses may be measured and designed to cover a standardised distance, such as 10\u00a0km (6.2\u00a0mi), or they may simply follow a set route between two landmarks.[65]  Road running courses over 5\u00a0km usually offer drinks or refreshment stations for runners at designated points alongside the course and medical professionals are present at the courses of major races due to the health risks involved with long-distance running.[65]  Elite road walks are conducted on closed loop courses (usually loops of 2,000 or 2,500 meters). Refreshment stations are also present over long distance walking competitions, with drinks being available on every lap for races longer than 10\u00a0km.[66]  In 1912, the formation of the international governing body for athletics, the International Amateur Athletics Federation, began. In recognition of the movement of the sport from amateurism towards professionalism that began in the late 1970s, the word amateur was dropped from the name, and the organization was rebranded as the International Association of Athletics Federations in 2001. In late 2019, another rebranding began, with World Athletics as the new title of the governing body.  World Athletics has 215 member nations and territories, which are divided into six continental areas (or area associations).[67] The six association areas are for Asia, Africa, Europe, Oceania, North and Central America and Caribbean and South America. The sports within athletics do not have their own independent governing bodies at either international or continental level; instead, all fall under the athletics authorities.[68][69]  National level athletics organisations are responsible for the regulation of the sport within their respective countries and most major competitions have some form of permit or approval from their national body.  Athletics competitions can be broadly divided into three types: international championships, national championships, and annual meetings and races. Athletics at international championships, or Games, represent the pinnacle of competition within the sport, and they are contested between athletes representing their country or region. The organisation of these competitions is usually overseen by either a world, continental, or regional athletics governing body. Athletes gain entry into these competitions by earning selection from their national athletics governing body, which is generally done by assessing athletes via their past achievements or performances at a national selection event. National championships are annual competitions endorsed by a national governing body which serve the purpose of deciding the country's best athlete in each event. Annual one-day meetings and races form the most basic level of competition and are the most common format of athletics contests. These events are often invitational and are organised by sports organisations, sports promoters, or other institutions.  Competitions typically feature only one of the sports within athletics. However, major outdoor international athletics championships and athletics competitions held as part of multi-sport events usually feature a combination of track and field, road running and racewalking events  The modern Summer Olympics was the first event at which a global athletics competition took place. All the four major sports within athletics have featured in the Olympic athletics programme since its inception in 1896, although cross country has since been dropped. The Olympic competition is the most prestigious athletics contest, and many athletics events are among the most watched events at the Summer Olympics. A total of 47 athletics events are held at the Olympics, 24 for men and 23 for women (as of London 2012). The events within the men's and women's programmes are either identical or have a similar equivalent, with the sole exception being that men contest the 50\u00a0km race walk.[70]  Following the model of the Olympics, various other multi-sport events arose during the 20th century, which included athletics as a core sport within the programme from the outset. These included the Commonwealth Games, the Central American and Caribbean Games, Universiade, and many others.  The Summer Paralympics include athletes with a physical disability. Track and field, and road events have featured in the Paralympic athletics programme since its inception in 1960. The Paralympic competition is the most prestigious athletics contest where athletes with a physical disability compete. Athletics at the Paralympic Games also include wheelchair racing where athletes compete in lightweight racing chairs. Athletes with a visual impairment compete with a sighted guide. At the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, for the first time at an international athletics event, the guides received medals,[71] such as the pilots in cycling, and the guides at the Paralympic Winter Games have done for a while.  The World Athletics Championships is the primary global athletics championships held by World Athletics. The biennial competition was first held in 1983 and now features an event programme which is identical to the Olympics. Thus, road running, racewalking and track and field are the sports which feature at the competition. Cross country running has its own discrete global championships \u2013 the World Athletics Cross Country Championships \u2013 which has been held annually since 1973. The World Athletics Indoor Championships is a biennial athletics championships which features solely indoor track and field events. The foremost separate road running event is the annual World Athletics Half Marathon Championships (formerly IAAF World Half Marathon Championships). While not having official world championship status, the biennial World Athletics Race Walking Team Championships fulfils a similar role for the sport of racewalking. Outdoor track and field is the only sport in athletics that does not have a its own distinct global championship which is separate from other types of athletics, although the IAAF Continental Cup (a quadrennial competition between continental teams) is composed entirely of outdoor track and field events.  Other world championships include the World Athletics U20 Championships and the 2017 defunct World Youth Championships in Athletics, which are for athletes under-19 and under-17, respectively. World Masters Athletics conducts the World Masters Athletics Championships for athletes in 5-year age divisions over the age of 35.  The now defunct IAAF World Road Relay Championships served as the global event for ekiden marathon relay races.   Elite athletes with a physical disability compete at the World Para Athletics Championships.  African, Asian, European, North & Central and Caribbean (NACAC), Oceania and South American Athletics Championships are held regularly in a variety of configurations. For example, the Oceania Area Championships in Athletics are combined with the Oceania U20 Athletics Championships. Most of the main regions hold separate cross-country, road-running and marathon championships.  There is the Pan American Combined Events Cup. Central American and Caribbean Championships are organised by the Central American and Caribbean Athletic Confederation (the CACAC)).  Athletics, and its athletes in particular, has been artistically depicted since ancient times \u2013 one of the surviving instances include runners and high jumpers in the motifs of Ancient Egyptian tombs dating from 2250\u00a0BC. Athletics was much respected in Ancient Greece and the events within the ancient pentathlon provided inspiration for large statues such as the Discobolus and Discophoros, and for motifs on countless vase and pottery works. Aristotle discussed the significance of the pentathlon in his treatise Rhetoric and reflected on the athlete aesthetic of the period: \"a body capable of enduring all efforts, either of the racecourse or of bodily strength...This is why the athletes in the pentathlon are most beautiful\".[72]  Films about athletics are overwhelmingly focused on running events: the 1962 film The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner (based on the book of the same name) explores cross country running as a means of escape. Chariots of Fire, perhaps one of the most well-known athletics films, is a fictionalised account of Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams's chase for sprint gold medals at the 1924 Olympics. Track and field has been the subject of American films such as Personal Best (1981) and Across the Tracks (1991). Biopics are found within the genre, including Prefontaine (regarding Steve Prefontaine) and Jim Thorpe \u2013 All-American (1951) featuring Burt Lancaster as Thorpe. Documentaries are also common with examples such as 2007 film Spirit of the Marathon, which follows runners' preparations for the 2005 Chicago Marathon.  Books on the subject are predominantly non-fiction, and tend towards the forms of training manuals and historical accounts of athletics. The story of the four-minute mile has been a particularly popular subject, spawning books such as The Perfect Mile and 3:59.4: The Quest to Break the Four Minute Mile.  Athletics journalism has spawned a number of dedicated periodicals including Athletics Weekly and Race Walking Record, both of which were first published in England in the early 1940s, and Track & Field News which was first published in the United States in 1948. Runner's World has been in print since 1966 and the Track & Field Magazine of Japan (Rikujyo Kyogi Magazine) is another long-running publication.  Athletics events have been selected as a main motif in numerous collectors' coins.  One of the recent samples is the \u20ac10 Greek Running commemorative coin, minted in 2003 to commemorate the 2004 Summer Olympics. In the obverse of the coin, a modern athlete figure appears in the foreground, shown in the starting position, while in the background two ancient runners are carved in a manner that gives the appearance of a coin that is \"worn\" by time. This scene originally appeared on a black-figure vase of the 6th century BC. "},{"title":"Penalty kick (association football)","content":"  A penalty kick (commonly known as a penalty or a spot kick) is a method of restarting play in association football, in which a player is allowed to take a single shot at the goal while it is defended only by the opposing team's goalkeeper. It is awarded when an offence punishable by a direct free kick is committed by a player in their own penalty area. The shot is taken from the penalty spot, which is 11 m (12 yards) from the goal line and centred between the touch lines.  The ball is placed on the penalty spot, regardless of where in the penalty area the foul occurred. The player taking the kick must be identified to the referee. Only the kicker and the defending team's goalkeeper are allowed to be within the penalty area; all other players must be within the field of play, outside the penalty area, behind the penalty mark, and a minimum of 9.15\u00a0m (10\u00a0yd) from the penalty mark (this distance is denoted by the penalty arc).[1] The goalkeeper is allowed to move before the ball is kicked, but must remain on the goal-line between the goal-posts, facing the kicker, without touching the goalposts, crossbar, or goal net.  At the moment the kick is taken, the goalkeeper must have at least part of one foot touching, or in line with, the goal line. The assistant referee responsible for the goal line where the penalty kick is being taken is positioned at the intersection of the penalty area and goal line, and assists the referee in looking for infringements and\/or whether a goal is scored.  The referee blows the whistle to indicate that the penalty kick may be taken. The kicker may make feinting (deceptive or distracting) movements during the run-up to the ball, but may not do so once the run-up is completed. The kick and the last step the kicker takes must be in motion. The ball must be stationary before the kick, and it must be kicked forward. The ball is in play once it is kicked and moves, and at that time other players may enter the penalty area and the penalty arc. The kicker may not touch the ball a second time until it has been touched by another player of either team or goes out of play (including into the goal).  In case of an infringement of the laws of the game during a penalty kick, most commonly entering the penalty area illegally, the referee must consider both whether the ball entered the goal, and which team(s) committed the offence. If both teams commit an offence, a rekick is taken.  The following infringements committed by the kicking team result in an indirect free kick for the defending team, regardless of the outcome of the kick:  In the case of a player repeatedly infringing the laws during the penalty kick, the referee may caution the player for persistent infringement. All offences that occur before kick may be dealt with in this manner, regardless of the location of the offence.  If the ball touches an outside agent (i.e., an object foreign to the playing field) as it moves forward from the kick, the kick is retaken.  A two-man penalty, or \"tap\" penalty, occurs when the kicker, instead of shooting for goal, taps the ball slightly forward so that a teammate can run on to it and shoot or pass. If properly executed, it is a legal play since the kicker is not required to shoot for goal and need only kick the ball forward. This strategy relies heavily on the element of surprise, as it first requires the goalkeeper to believe the kicker will actually shoot, then dive or move to one side in response. It then requires the goalkeeper to remain out of position long enough for the kicker's teammate to reach the ball before any defenders, and for that teammate to place a shot on the undefended side of the goal.  The first recorded tap penalty was taken by Jimmy McIlroy and Danny Blanchflower of Northern Ireland against Portugal on 1 May 1957.[2] Another was taken by Rik Coppens and Andr\u00e9 Piters in the World Cup qualifying match Belgium versus Iceland on 5 June 1957. Another attempt was made by Mike Trebilcock and John Newman, playing for Plymouth Argyle in 1964.[3] In 1982, Johan Cruyff passed to his Ajax team-mate Jesper Olsen, who then passed back, allowing Cruyff to tap in for a goal.[3]  Arsenal players Thierry Henry and Robert Pires failed in an attempt at a similar penalty in 2005, during a Premier League match against Manchester City at Highbury. Pires ran in to take the kick, attempted to pass to the onrushing Henry, but miskicked and the ball hardly moved; as he had slightly touched the ball, he could not touch it again, and City defender Sylvain Distin cleared the ball before Henry could shoot.[4]  Lionel Messi tapped a penalty for Luis Su\u00e1rez as Su\u00e1rez completed his hat-trick on 14 February 2016 against league opponents Celta de Vigo.[5]  Defending against a penalty kick is one of the most difficult tasks a goalkeeper can face. Owing to the short distance between the penalty spot and the goal, there is very little time to react to the shot. Because of this, the goalkeeper will usually start their dive before the ball is actually struck. In effect, the goalkeeper must act on their best prediction about where the shot will be aimed. Some goalkeepers decide which way they will dive beforehand, thus giving themselves a good chance of diving in time. Others try to read the kicker's motion pattern. On the other side, kickers often feign and prefer a relatively slow shot in an attempt to foil the goalkeeper. The potentially most fruitful approach, shooting high and centre, i.e., in the space that the goalkeeper will evacuate, also carries the highest risk of shooting above the bar (or even hitting it).  As the shooter makes their approach to the ball, the goalkeeper has only a fraction of a second to \"read\" the shooter's motions and decide where the ball will go. If their guess is correct, this may result in a missed penalty. Helmuth Duckadam, Steaua Bucure\u0219ti's goalkeeper, saved a record four consecutive penalties in the 1986 European Cup Final against Barcelona. He dived three times to the right and a fourth time to his left to save all penalties taken, securing victory for his team.  A goalkeeper may also rely on knowledge of the shooter's past behaviour to inform their decision. An example of this would be by former Netherlands national team goalkeeper Hans van Breukelen, who always had a box with cards with all the information about the opponent's penalty specialist. Ecuadorian goalkeeper Marcelo Elizaga saving a penalty from Carlos Tevez in a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier between Ecuador and Argentina, revealed that he had studied some penalty kicks from Tevez and suspected he was going to shoot to the goalkeeper's left side. Two other examples occurred during the 2006 FIFA World Cup:  This approach may not always be successful; the player may intentionally switch from their favoured spot after witnessing the goalkeeper obtaining knowledge of their kicks. Most times, especially in amateur football, the goalkeeper is often forced to guess. Game theoretic research shows that both the penalty taker and also the goalkeeper must randomize their strategies in precise ways to avoid having the opponent take advantage of their predictability.[7]  The goalkeeper also may try to distract the penalty taker, as the expectation is on the penalty taker to succeed, hence more pressure on the penalty taker, making them more vulnerable to mistakes. For example, in the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final between Manchester United and Chelsea, United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar pointed to his left side when Nicolas Anelka stepped up to take a shot in the penalty shoot out. This was because all of Chelsea's penalties went to the left. Anelka's shot instead went to Van der Sar's right, which was saved. Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar used a method of distracting the players called the \"spaghetti legs\" trick to help his club defeat Roma to win the 1984 European Cup. This tactic was emulated in the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final, which Liverpool also won, by Liverpool goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek, helping his team defeat Milan.  An illegal method of saving penalties is for the goalkeeper to make a quick and short jump forward just before the penalty taker connects with the ball. This not only shuts down the angle of the shot, but also distracts the penalty taker. The method was used by Brazilian goalkeeper Cl\u00e1udio Taffarel. FIFA was less strict on the rule during that time. In more recent times, FIFA has advised all referees to strictly obey the rule book.[citation needed]  Similarly, a goalkeeper may also attempt to delay a penalty by cleaning their boots, asking the referee to see if the ball is placed properly and other delaying tactics. This method builds more pressure on the penalty taker, but the goalkeeper may risk punishments, most likely a yellow card.  A goalkeeper can also try to distract the taker by talking to them prior to the penalty being taken. Netherlands national team goalkeeper Tim Krul used this technique during the penalty shootout in the quarter-final match of the 2014 FIFA World Cup against Costa Rica. As the Costa Rican players were preparing to take the kick, Krul told them that he \"knew where they were going to put their penalty\" in order to \"get in their heads\".[8] This resulted in him saving two penalties and the Netherlands winning the shootout 4\u20133.  Argentine goalkeeper Emiliano Mart\u00ednez is known for using mind games in shootouts, most notably when he talked to the Colombian players as they went to take their penalties in the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica semifinal, and throwing the ball away when Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni was about to kick in the 2022 FIFA World Cup final.  Some goalkeepers have become well known for their ability to save penalty kicks. One such goalkeeper is Diego Alves, who boasts a 49 per cent save success rate. Other goalkeepers with high save rates include Claudio Bravo, Kevin Trapp, Samir Handanovi\u0107, Gianluigi Buffon, Tim Krul, Danijel Suba\u0161i\u0107, Sergio Goycochea, Sergio Romero, and Manuel Neuer.[9][10][11]  Even if the goalkeeper succeeds in blocking the shot, the ball may rebound back to the penalty taker or one of their teammates for another shot, with the goalkeeper often in a poor position to make a second save. This makes saving penalty kicks more difficult. This is not a concern in penalty shoot-outs, where only a single shot is permitted.  While penalty kicks are considerably more often successful than not, missed penalty kicks are not uncommon: for instance, of the 78 penalty kicks taken during the 2005\u201306 English Premier League season, 57 resulted in a goal, thus almost 30% of the penalties were unsuccessful.[12]  A German professor who has been studying penalty statistics in the German Bundesliga for 16 years found 76% of all the penalties during those 16 years went in, and 99% of the shots in the higher half of the goal went in[citation needed], although the higher half of the goal is a more difficult target to aim at. During his career, Italian striker Roberto Baggio had two occurrences where his shot hit the upper bar, bounced downwards, rebounded off the keeper and passed the goal line for a goal.  A penalty kick is awarded whenever one of the following offences is committed by a player within that player's own penalty area while the ball is in play (the ball must be in play at the time of the offence, but it does not need to be within the penalty area at that time).[13][14]  A penalty kick is also awarded if, while the ball is in play, a player, substitute, substituted player, sent-off player or team official commits any direct free-kick offence against a match official or against an opposing player, substitute, substituted player, sent-off player, or team official outside the field of play, provided that the closest boundary line to the location of the offence is within the offending team's own penalty area.[23]  The original laws of the game, in 1863, had no defined punishments for infringements of the rules.[24] In 1872, the indirect free kick was introduced as a punishment for illegal handling of the ball; it was later extended to other offences.[25] This indirect free-kick was thought to be an inadequate remedy for a handball which prevented an otherwise-certain goal.[26] As a result of this, in 1882 a law was introduced to award a goal to a team prevented from scoring by an opponent's handball.  This law lasted only one season before being abolished in 1883.  One possible reason for its abolition is that it was felt to be too harsh, especially given the imprecise nature of refereeing at the time. Another possibility is that it was simply not seen as necessary, as the indirect free kick was thought to be a sufficient punishment for most handball offenses.  The invention of the penalty kick is credited to the goalkeeper and businessman William McCrum in 1890 in Milford, County Armagh.[27] The Irish Football Association presented the idea to the International Football Association Board's 1890 meeting, where it was deferred until the next meeting in 1891.[28]  Two incidents in the 1890\u20131 season lent additional force to the argument for the penalty kick.  On 20 December 1890, in the Scottish Cup quarter-final between East Stirlingshire and Heart of Midlothian Jimmy Adams[29] fisted the ball out from under the bar,[30][31] and on 14 February 1891, there was a blatant goal-line handball by a Notts County player in the FA Cup quarter-final against Stoke City   Finally after much debate, the International Football Association Board approved the idea on 2 June 1891.[32][33] The penalty-kick law ran:  If any player shall intentionally trip or hold an opposing player, or deliberately handle the ball, within twelve yards [11\u00a0m] from his own goal-line, the referee shall, on appeal, award the opposing side a penalty kick, to be taken from any point twelve yards [11\u00a0m] from the goal-line, under the following conditions:\u2014 All players, with the exception of the player taking the penalty kick and the opposing goalkeeper (who shall not advance more than six yards [5.5\u00a0m] from the goal-line) shall stand at least six yards [5.5\u00a0m] behind the ball. The ball shall be in play when the kick is taken, and a goal may be scored from the penalty kick.[34] Some notable differences between this original 1891 law and today's penalty-kick are listed below:  The world's first penalty kick was awarded just 5 days after the change had been approved and introduced to the rules of the game by the Scottish Football Association. It was awarded to Airdrieonians against Royal Albert in the final of the Airdrie Charity Cup on 6 June 1891 at Airdrieonians' then home ground of Mavisbank Park[35] 15 minutes into the match, with the eventual spot-kick being buried past the Albert keeper. The first penalty kick in the Football League was awarded to Wolverhampton Wanderers in their match against Accrington at Molineux Stadium on 14 September 1891. The penalty was taken and scored by Billy Heath[36] as Wolves went on to win the game 5\u20130.  In 1892, the player taking the penalty-kick was forbidden to kick the ball again before the ball had touched another player.  A provision was also added that \"[i]f necessary, time of play shall be extended to admit of the penalty kick being taken\".[37]  In 1896, the ball was required to be kicked forward, and the requirement for an appeal was removed.[38]  In 1902, the penalty area was introduced with its current dimensions (a rectangle extending 18 yards (16\u00a0m) from the goal-posts).  The penalty spot was also introduced, 12 yards (11\u00a0m) from the goal.  All other players were required to be outside the penalty area.[39]  In 1905, the goalkeeper was required to remain on the goal-line.[40]  In 1923, all other players were required to be at least 10 yards (9.15\u00a0m) from the penalty-spot (in addition to being outside the penalty-area).[41] This change was made in order to stop defenders from lining up on the edge of the penalty area to impede the player taking the kick.[42]  In 1930, a footnote was appended to the laws, stating that \"the goal-keeper must not move his feet until the penalty kick has been taken\".[43]  In 1937, an arc (colloquially known as the \"D\") was added to the pitch markings, to assist in the enforcement of the 10-yard (9.15\u00a0m) restriction.[44] The goalkeeper was required to stand between the goal-posts.[44]  In 1939, it was specified that the ball must travel the distance of its circumference before being in play.[45] In 1997, this requirement was eliminated: the ball became in play as soon as it was kicked and moved forward.[46] In 2016, it was specified that the ball must \"clearly\" move.[47]  In 1995, all other players were required to remain behind the penalty spot.  The Scottish Football Association claimed that this new provision would \"eliminate various problems which have arisen regarding the position of players who stand in front of the penalty-mark at the taking of a penalty-kick as is presently permitted\".[48]  In 1997, the goalkeeper was once again allowed to move the feet, and was also required to face the kicker.[49]  The question of \"feinting\" during the run-up to a penalty was popularized by Pel\u00e9 in the 1970s and it was called paradinha, which in Portuguese means \"little stop\".[50] It has occupied the International FA Board since 1982, when it was decided that \"if a player stops in his run-up it is an offence for which he shall be cautioned (for ungentlemanly conduct) by the referee\".[51] However, in 1985 the same body reversed itself, deciding that the \"assumption that feigning was an offence\" was \"wrong\", and that it was up to the Referee to decide whether any instance should be penalized as ungentlemanly conduct.[52] From 2000 to 2006, documents produced by IFAB specified that feinting during the run-up to a penalty-kick was permitted.[53] In 2007, this guidance emphasized that \"if in the opinion of the referee the feinting is considered an act of unsporting behaviour, the player shall be cautioned\".[54] In 2010, because of concern over \"an increasing trend in players feinting a penalty kick to deceive the goalkeeper\", a proposal was adopted to specify that while \"feinting in the run-up to take a penalty kick to confuse opponents is permitted as part of football\", \"feinting to kick the ball once the player has completed his run-up is considered an infringement of Law 14 and an act of unsporting behaviour for which the player must be cautioned\".[55]  Since its introduction in 1891, a penalty kick has been awarded for two broad categories of offences:  The number of offences eligible for punishment by a penalty-kick, small when initially introduced in 1891, expanded rapidly thereafter. This led to some confusion: for example, in September 1891, a referee awarded a penalty kick against a goalkeeper who \"[lost] his temper and [kicked] an opponent\", even though under the 1891 laws this offence was punishable only by an indirect free-kick.[56]  The table below shows the punishments[57] specified by the laws for offences involving handling the ball or physical contact, between 1890 and 1903:[58]  Since 1903, the offences for which a penalty kick is awarded within the defending team's penalty area have been identical to those for which a direct free kick is awarded outside the defending team's penalty area.  These consisted of handball (excluding technical handling offences by the goalkeeper), and foul play, with the following exceptions (which were punished instead by an indirect free kick in the penalty area):[62] "},{"title":"Gaelic football, hurling and camogie positions","content":"  The following are the positions in the Gaelic sports of Gaelic football, hurling and camogie.  Each team consists of one goalkeeper (who wears a different colour jersey), six backs, two midfielders, and six forwards: 15 players in all. Some under-age games are played 13-a-side (in which case the full-back and full-forward positions are removed) or 11-a-side (in which case the full-back, centre back, centre forward and full-forward positions are removed).[1]  The positions are listed below, with the jersey number usually worn by players in that position given.  The role of a goalkeeper, who wears the number 1 jersey in Gaelic games, is similar to other codes: to prevent the ball from entering the goal. The goalkeeper in Gaelic football and hurling also usually has the role of kicking or pucking the ball out to the outfield players. A good goalkeeper most often has great agility and bravery as well as strength and height. In Gaelic football a keeper's shot stopping ability is of great importance alongside blocking. There is no limit to where on the field the goalkeeper can travel, although once they are outside the penalty area, they are subject to the same rules as all other players. A goalkeeper in men's football may touch the ball on the ground within his own small parallelogram, and is the only player permitted to do so.It is not permitted to physically challenge a goalkeeper while inside his own small parallelogram, but players may harass him into playing a bad pass, or block an attempted pass. The substitute goalkeeper usually wears the number 16 jersey and the third choice goalkeeper usually wears the number 31.  The role of the right and left corner-back who, respectively, wear the number 2 and number 4 jerseys, is to defend against opposing attackers \u2013 in particular the left and right corner-forwards. They will play most around the 20-metre line. The positions require the players having decent speed over short bursts and good hand eye co-ordination, and agility is required.  The role of full-back who wears the number 3 jersey is one of the most important in Gaelic football or hurling. As well as defending against attackers, the full-back is responsible for organising the defence and is the key defender in front of goals, and is usually one of the tallest and strongest players on the team. The full back plays most often around the 20-metre line. The position of the full-back requires that the player have decent speed over short bursts, strength, and good hand eye co-ordination. In playing either corner-back or full-back positions a well-developed aerobic system is required although, unlike the corner-backs, the full-back is needed to make short burst sprints both away from and into the goal area.  The role of the half backs who wear the 5 (right) and 7 (left) jerseys is less defensive than that of the corner-backs. The half-backs operate most often in between the 45-metre line and the midfield. The half-backs are expected to defend against the opposition's half-forward line but also has a responsibility to make runs from the 45-metre line to advance the play to the half-forward and full-forward lines.  Sometimes referred to as right\/left wing-back.  The role of the centre half-back who wears the number 6 jersey, is less defensive than that of the full-back. The centre backs operates from the 45-metre line and forward to the midfield. The centre back will help win the breaking ball in the midfield and can be used as a third midfielder. The centre half-back generally marks the centre half-forward. Sometimes referred to as centre back. The required agilities of a centre half-back are strength, height, speed and a good catching game.  The role of the midfield who wears the number 8 or 9 jersey is to catch kick outs \/ puck outs from either team's goalkeeper, and to act as the main link between the defending and attacking sections of the team. Midfield is often described as the most important role on the pitch. If the opposing goalkeeper is kicking the ball to the middle of the field, the midfielder has the responsibility to retrieve the ball and therefore prevent the opposing team from taking advantage and bringing the ball forward. This then gives a new responsibility to the midfielder to get the ball moving forward to the half forward and full forward lines.  The position requires the player to have strength, height, speed, good catching ability, a good kicking game and, most importantly, endurance. It is important for the midfield to have a good understanding of their goalkeeper. They must anticipate where their goalkeeper will place the ball and therefore take advantage and bring the ball forward. Note that there is rarely a \"left midfielder\" and \"right midfielder\" \u2013 both play 'off' each other as a combined unit.  If one midfielder is attacking, the other always goes up the field with him in support. Both midfielders always attack or defend at the same time.  The role of the right and left wing-forward who wear, respectively, numbers 10 and number 12 jerseys, is to build up attacks and to feed the ball to the full-forward line and also taking shots on goal or above the bar when opportunities present themselves. The wing-forwards will cover much ground and utilising speedy wing-forwards to run at defences is a common tactic. They operate from the midfield to the opposition's 45 metre line. The right wing-forward's main opposing player is the left wing-back and vice versa.  Sometimes referred to as right\/left half forward.  The role of the centre -forward who wears the number 11 jersey, is to build up attacks and feed the ball to the full-forward line. The centre -forward is responsible for taking shots on goal and points when opportunities present themselves. The centre forward will cover much ground and utilising speedy half forwards to run at defences is a common tactic. The centre forward also helps win breaking ball in the midfield, helping to win the possession to bring the ball forward. The centre forward operates from the midfield to the opposition's 45-metre line.  Sometimes referred to as half forward.  The role of the left and right corner-forwards, who wear the number 15 and 13 jerseys respectively, is to watch the full-forward's breaks and to score points and goals. The full-forward line operates around the opposition's 21-metre line. The corner-forwards are generally marked by the corner-backs.  The role of the full-forward who wears the number 14 jersey is to score goals in particular although points are usually the outcome of their attempts on goal. The full-forward line operates around the opposition's 21-metre line. The full-forward is generally marked by the full back.  It is common for teams to employ a tall full-forward to pluck high balls from the sky and to challenge the size and strength of the full-back.  Substitutes wear jersey numbers 16 upwards (usually up to 31). 16 is usually worn by the substitute goalkeeper, and the third choice goalkeeper usually wears the number 31 jersey. "},{"title":"American football","content":"  American football (referred to simply as football in the United States and Canada), also known as gridiron football,[nb 1] is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. The offense, the team with possession of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or throwing it, while the defense, the team without possession of the ball, aims to stop the offense's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays; if they fail, they turn over the football to the defense, but if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive. A game is won by the team with the higher number of points, which are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal.  American football evolved in the United States, originating from the sports of soccer and rugby. The first American football match was played on November 6, 1869, between two college teams, Rutgers and Princeton, using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time. A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp, the \"Father of American Football\", established the snap, the line of scrimmage, eleven-player teams, and the concept of downs. Later rule changes legalized the forward pass, created the neutral zone, and specified the size and shape of the football. The sport is closely related to Canadian football, which evolved in parallel with and at the same time as the American game, although its rules were developed independently from those of Camp. Most of the features that distinguish American football from rugby and soccer are also present in Canadian football. The two sports are considered the primary variants of gridiron football.  American football is the most popular sport in the United States in terms of broadcast viewership audience. The most popular forms of the game are professional and college football, with the other major levels being high-school and youth football. As of 2022[update], nearly 1.04\u00a0million high-school athletes play the sport in the U.S., with another 81,000 college athletes in the NCAA and the NAIA.[3] The National Football League (NFL) has the highest average attendance of any professional sports league in the world. Its championship game, the Super Bowl, ranks among the most-watched club sporting events globally. In 2022, the league had an annual revenue of around $18.6\u00a0billion,[4] making it the most valuable sports league in the world.[5] Other professional and amateur leagues exist worldwide, but the sport does not have the international popularity of other American sports like baseball or basketball; the sport maintains a growing following in the rest of North America, Europe, Brazil, and Japan.  In the United States, American football is referred to as \"football\".[6] The term \"football\" was officially established in the rulebook for the 1876 college football season, when the sport first shifted from soccer-style rules to rugby-style rules. Although it could easily have been called \"rugby\" at this point, Harvard, one of the primary proponents of the rugby-style game, compromised and did not request the name of the sport be changed to \"rugby\".[7] The terms \"gridiron\" or \"American football\" are favored in English-speaking countries where other types of football are popular, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia.[8][9]  American football evolved from the sports of rugby and soccer. Rugby, like American football, is a sport in which two competing teams vie for control of a ball, which can be kicked through a set of goalposts or run into the opponent's goal area to score points.[10]  What is considered to be the first American football game was played on November 6, 1869, between Rutgers and Princeton, two college teams. They consisted of 25 players per team and used a round ball that could not be picked up or carried. It could, however, be kicked or batted with the feet, hands, head, or sides, with the objective being to advance it into the opponent's goal. Rutgers won the game 6\u20134.[11][12] Collegiate play continued for several years with matches played using the rules of the host school. Representatives of Yale, Columbia, Princeton and Rutgers met on October 19, 1873, to create a standard set of rules for use by all schools. Teams were set at 20 players each, and fields of 400 by 250 feet (122\u00a0m \u00d7\u00a076\u00a0m) were specified. Harvard abstained from the conference, as they favored a rugby-style game that allowed running with the ball.[12] After playing McGill University using both American (known as \"the Boston game\") for the first game and Canadian (rugby) rules for the second one,[12][13] the Harvard players preferred the Canadian style of having only 11 men on the field, running the ball without having to be chased by an opponent, the forward pass, tackling, and using an oblong instead of a round ball.[14][15]  An 1875 Harvard\u2013Yale game played under rugby-style rules was observed by two Princeton athletes who were impressed by it. They introduced the sport to Princeton, a feat the Professional Football Researchers Association compared to \"selling refrigerators to Eskimos\".[12] Princeton, Harvard, Yale, and Columbia then agreed to intercollegiate play using a form of rugby union rules with a modified scoring system.[16] These schools formed the Intercollegiate Football Association, although Yale did not join until 1879. Yale player Walter Camp, now regarded as the \"Father of American Football\",[16][17] secured rule changes in 1880 that reduced the size of each team from 15 to 11 players and instituted the snap to replace the chaotic and inconsistent scrum.[16] While the game between Rutgers and Princeton is commonly considered the first American football game, several years prior in 1862, the Oneida Football Club formed as the oldest known football club in the United States. The team consisted of graduates of Boston's elite preparatory schools and played from 1862 to 1865.[18]  The introduction of the snap resulted in an unexpected consequence. Before the snap, the strategy had been to punt if a scrum resulted in bad field position. However, a group of Princeton players realized that, as the snap was uncontested, they could now hold the ball indefinitely to prevent their opponent from scoring. In 1881, in a game between Yale and Princeton, both teams used this strategy to maintain their undefeated records. Each team held the ball, gaining no ground, for an entire half, resulting in a 0\u20130 tie. This \"block game\" proved extremely unpopular with both teams' spectators and fans.[16]  A rule change was necessary to prevent this strategy from taking hold, and a reversion to the scrum was considered. However, Camp successfully proposed a rule in 1882 that limited each team to three downs, or tackles, to advance the ball 5 yards (4.6\u00a0m). Failure to advance the ball the required distance within those three downs would result in control of the ball being forfeited to the other team. This change effectively made American football a separate sport from rugby, and the resulting five-yard lines added to the field to measure distances made it resemble a gridiron in appearance. Other major rule changes included a reduction of the field size to 110 by 53+1\u20443 yards (100.6\u00a0m \u00d7\u00a048.8\u00a0m) and the adoption of a scoring system that awarded four points for a touchdown, two for a safety and a goal following a touchdown, and five for a goal from the field. Additionally, tackling below the waist was legalized,[16] and a static line of scrimmage was instituted.[19]  Despite these new rules, football remained a violent sport. Dangerous mass-formations like the flying wedge resulted in serious injuries and deaths.[20] A 1905 peak of 19 fatalities nationwide resulted in a threat by President Theodore Roosevelt to abolish the game unless major changes were made.[21] In response, 62 colleges and universities met in New York City to discuss rule changes on December 28, 1905. These proceedings resulted in the formation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States, later renamed the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).[22]  The legal forward pass was introduced in 1906, although its effect was initially minimal due to the restrictions placed on its use. The idea of a 40-yard-wider field was opposed by Harvard due to the size of the new Harvard Stadium.[23] Other rule changes introduced that year included the reduction of playing time from 70 to 60 minutes and an increase of the distance required for a first down from 5 to 10 yards (4.6 to 9.1\u00a0m). To reduce infighting and dirty play between teams, the neutral zone was created along the width of the football before the snap.[24] Scoring was also adjusted: points awarded for field goals were reduced to three in 1909[17] and points for touchdowns were raised to six in 1912.[25] Also in 1912, the field was shortened to 100 yards (91\u00a0m) long, two 10-yard-long (9.1\u00a0m) end zones were created, and teams were given four downs instead of three to advance the ball 10 yards (9.1\u00a0m).[26][27] The roughing the passer penalty was implemented in 1914, and eligible players were first allowed to catch the ball anywhere on the field in 1918.[28]  On November 12, 1892, Pudge Heffelfinger was paid $500 (equivalent to $16,956 in 2023) to play a game for the Allegheny Athletic Association in a match against the Pittsburgh Athletic Club. This is the first recorded instance of a player being paid to participate in a game of American football, although many athletic clubs in the 1880s offered indirect benefits, such as helping players attain employment, giving out trophies or watches that players could pawn for money, or paying double in expense money. Despite these extra benefits, the game had a strict sense of amateurism at the time, and direct payment to players was frowned upon, if not prohibited outright.[29]  Over time, professional play became increasingly common, and with it came rising salaries and unpredictable player movement, as well as the illegal payment of college players who were still in school. The National Football League (NFL), a group of professional teams that was originally established in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association, aimed to solve these problems. This new league's stated goals included an end to bidding wars over players, prevention of the use of college players, and abolition of the practice of paying players to leave another team.[30] By 1922, the NFL had established itself as America's premier professional football league.[31]  The dominant form of football at the time was played at the collegiate level. The upstart NFL received a boost to its legitimacy in 1925, however, when an NFL team, the Pottsville Maroons, defeated a team of Notre Dame all-stars in an exhibition game.[32] A greater emphasis on the passing game helped professional football to distinguish itself further from the college game during the late 1930s.[30] Football, in general, became increasingly popular following the 1958 NFL Championship game, a match between the Baltimore Colts and the New York Giants that is still referred to as the \"Greatest Game Ever Played\". The game, a 23\u201317 overtime victory by the Colts, was seen by millions of television viewers and had a major influence on the popularity of the sport. This, along with the innovations introduced by the new American Football League (AFL) in the early 1960s, helped football to become the most popular sport in the United States by the mid-1960s.[33]  The rival AFL arose in 1960 and challenged the NFL's dominance. The AFL began in relative obscurity but eventually thrived, with an initial television contract with the ABC television network. The AFL's existence forced the conservative NFL to expand to Dallas and Minnesota in an attempt to destroy the new league. Meanwhile, the AFL introduced many new features to professional football in the United States: official time was kept on a scoreboard clock rather than on a watch in the referee's pocket, as the NFL did; optional two-point conversions by pass or run after touchdowns; names on the jerseys of players; and several others, including expansion of the role of minority players, actively recruited by the league in contrast to the NFL. The AFL also signed several star college players who had also been drafted by NFL teams. Competition for players heated up in 1965, when the AFL New York Jets signed rookie Joe Namath to a then-record $437,000 contract (equivalent to $4.23 million in 2023). A five-year, $40\u00a0million  NBC television contract followed, which helped to sustain the young league. The bidding war for players ended in 1966 when NFL owners approached the AFL regarding a merger, and the two leagues agreed on one that took full effect in 1970. This agreement provided for a common draft that would take place each year, and it instituted an annual World Championship game to be played between the champions of each league. This championship game began play at the end of the 1966 season. Once the merger was completed, it was no longer a championship game between two leagues and reverted to the NFL championship game, which came to be known as the Super Bowl.[34]  College football maintained a tradition of postseason bowl games. Each bowl game was associated with a particular conference and earning a spot in a bowl game was the reward for winning a conference. This arrangement was profitable, but it tended to prevent the two top-ranked teams from meeting in a true national championship game, as they would normally be committed to the bowl games of their respective conferences. Several systems have been used since 1992 to determine a national champion of college football. The first was the Bowl Coalition, in place from 1992 to 1994. This was replaced in 1995 by the Bowl Alliance, which gave way to the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) in 1997.[35] The BCS arrangement proved to be controversial, and was replaced in 2014 by the College Football Playoff (CFP).[36][37]  A football game is played between two teams of 11 players each.[38][39][40] Playing with more on the field is punishable by a penalty.[38][41][42] Teams may substitute any number of their players between downs;[43][44][45] this \"platoon\" system replaced the original system, which featured limited substitution rules, and has resulted in teams utilizing specialized offensive, defensive and special teams units.[46] The number of players allowed on an active roster varies by league; the NFL has a 53-man roster,[47] while NCAA Division I allows teams to have 63 scholarship players in the FCS and 85 scholarship players in the FBS, respectively.[48]  Individual players in a football game must be designated with a uniform number between 1 and 99, though some teams may \"retire\" certain numbers, making them unavailable to players. NFL teams are required to number their players by a league-approved numbering system, and any exceptions must be approved by the commissioner.[38] NCAA and NFHS teams are \"strongly advised\" to number their offensive players according to a league-suggested numbering scheme.[49][50]  Although the sport is played almost exclusively by men, women are eligible to play in high school, college, and professional football. No woman has ever played in the NFL, but women have played in high school and college football games.[51] In 2018, 1,100 of the 225,000 players in Pop Warner Little Scholars youth football were girls, and around 11% of the 5.5\u00a0million Americans who report playing tackle football are female according to the Sports and Fitness Industry Association.[52]  The role of the offensive unit is to advance the football down the field with the ultimate goal of scoring a touchdown.[53]  The offensive team must line up in a legal formation before they can snap the ball. An offensive formation is considered illegal if there are more than four players in the backfield or fewer than five players numbered 50\u201379 on the offensive line.[39][54][55] Players can line up temporarily in a position whose eligibility is different from what their number permits as long as they report the change immediately to the referee, who then informs the defensive team of the change.[56] Neither team's players, except the center (C), are allowed to line up in or cross the neutral zone until the ball is snapped. Interior offensive linemen are not allowed to move until the snap of the ball.[57]  The main backfield positions are the quarterback (QB), halfback\/tailback (HB\/TB), and fullback (FB). The quarterback is the leader of the offense. Either the quarterback or a coach calls the plays. Quarterbacks typically inform the rest of the offense of the play in the huddle before the team lines up. The quarterback lines up behind the center to take the snap and then hands the ball off, throws it, or runs with it.[53]  The primary role of the halfback, also known as the running back or tailback, is to carry the ball on running plays. Halfbacks may also serve as receivers. Fullbacks tend to be larger than halfbacks and function primarily as blockers, but they are sometimes used as runners in short-yardage or goal-line situations.[58] They are seldom used as receivers.[59]  The offensive line (OL) consists of several players whose primary function is to block members of the defensive line from tackling the ball carrier on running plays or sacking the quarterback on passing plays.[58] The leader of the offensive line is the center, who is responsible for snapping the ball to the quarterback, blocking,[58] and for making sure that the other linemen do their jobs during the play.[60] On either side of the center are the guards (G), while tackles (T) line up outside the guards.  The principal receivers are the wide receivers (WR) and the tight ends (TE).[61] Wide receivers line up on or near the line of scrimmage, split outside the line. The main goal of the wide receiver is to catch passes thrown by the quarterback,[58] but they may also function as decoys or as blockers during running plays. Tight ends line up outside the tackles and function both as receivers and as blockers.[58]  The role of the defense is to prevent the offense from scoring by tackling the ball carrier or by forcing turnovers (interceptions or fumbles).[53]  The defensive line (DL) consists of defensive ends (DE) and defensive tackles (DT). Defensive ends line up on the ends of the line, while defensive tackles line up inside, between the defensive ends. The primary responsibilities of defensive ends and defensive tackles are to stop running plays on the outside and inside, respectively, to pressure the quarterback on passing plays, and to occupy the line so that the linebackers can break through.[58]  Linebackers line up behind the defensive line but in front of the defensive backfield. They are divided into two types: middle linebackers (MLB) and outside linebackers (OLB). Linebackers tend to serve as the defensive leaders and call the defensive plays, given their vantage point of the offensive backfield. Their roles include defending the run, pressuring the quarterback, and tackling backs, wide receivers, and tight ends in the passing game.[62]  The defensive backfield, often called the secondary, consists of cornerbacks (CB) and safeties (S). Safeties are themselves divided into free safeties (FS) and strong safeties (SS).[58] Cornerbacks line up outside the defensive formation, typically opposite a receiver to be able to cover them. Safeties line up between the cornerbacks but farther back in the secondary. Safeties tend to be viewed as \"the last line of defense\" and are responsible for stopping deep passing plays as well as breakout running plays.[58]  The special teams unit is responsible for all kicking plays. The special teams unit of the team in control of the ball tries to execute field goal (FG) attempts, punts, and kickoffs, while the opposing team's unit will aim to block or return them.[53]  Three positions are specific to the field goal and PAT (point-after-touchdown) unit: the placekicker (K or PK), holder (H), and long snapper (LS). The long snapper's job is to snap the football to the holder, who will catch and position it for the placekicker. There is not usually a holder on kickoffs, because the ball is kicked off a tee; however, a holder may be used in certain situations, such as if wind is preventing the ball from remaining upright on the tee. The player on the receiving team who catches the ball is known as the kickoff returner (KR).[63]  The positions specific to punt plays are the punter (P), long snapper, upback, and gunner. The long snapper snaps the football directly to the punter, who then drops and kicks it before it hits the ground. Gunners line up split outside the line and race down the field, aiming to tackle the punt returner (PR)\u2014the player who catches the punt. Upbacks line up a short distance behind the line of scrimmage, providing additional protection to the punter.[64]  In football, the winner is the team that has scored more points at the end of the game. There are multiple ways to score in a football game. The touchdown (TD), worth six points, is the most valuable scoring play in American football. A touchdown is scored when a live ball is advanced into, caught, or recovered in the opposing team's end zone.[53] The scoring team then attempts a try, more commonly known as the point(s)-after-touchdown (PAT) or conversion, which is a single scoring opportunity. This is generally attempted from the two- or three-yard line, depending on the level of play. If the PAT is scored by a place kick or drop kick through the goal posts, it is worth one point, typically called the extra point. If the PAT is scored by what would normally be a touchdown, it is worth two points; this is known as a two-point conversion. In general, the extra point is almost always successful, while the two-point conversion is a much riskier play with a higher probability of failure; accordingly, extra point attempts are far more common than two-point conversion attempts.[65]  A field goal (FG), worth three points, is scored when the ball is place kicked or drop kicked through the uprights and over the crossbars of the defense's goalposts.[66][67][68] In practice, almost all field goal attempts are done via place kick. While drop kicks were common in the early days of the sport, the shape of modern footballs makes it difficult to reliably drop kick the ball. The last successful scoring play by drop kick in the NFL was accomplished in 2006; prior to that, the last successful drop kick had been made in 1941.[69] After a PAT attempt or successful field goal, the scoring team must kick the ball off to the other team.[70]  A safety is scored when the ball carrier is tackled in his own end zone. Safeties are worth two points, which are awarded to the defense.[53] In addition, the team that conceded the safety must kick the ball to the scoring team via a free kick.[71]  Football games are played on a rectangular field that measures 120 yards (110\u00a0m) long and 53+1\u20443 yards (48.8\u00a0m) wide. Lines marked along the ends and sides of the field are known as the end lines and sidelines. Goal lines are marked 10 yards (9.1\u00a0m) inward from each end line.[72][73][74]  Weighted pylons are placed the sidelines on the inside corner of the intersections with the goal lines and end lines. White markings on the field identify the distance from the end zone. Inbound lines, or hash marks, are short parallel lines that mark off 1-yard (0.91\u00a0m) increments. Yard lines, which can run the width of the field, are marked every 5 yards (4.6\u00a0m). A one-yard-wide line is placed at each end of the field; this line is marked at the center of the two-yard line in professional play and at the three-yard line in college play. Numerals that display the distance from the closest goal line in yards are placed on both sides of the field every ten yards.[72][73][74]  Goalposts are located at the center of the plane of the two end lines. The crossbar of these posts is 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) above the ground, with vertical uprights at the end of the crossbar 18\u00a0feet 6\u00a0inches (5.64\u00a0m) apart for professional and collegiate play, and 23\u00a0feet 4\u00a0inches (7.11\u00a0m) apart for high school play.[75][76][77] The uprights extend vertically 35 feet (11\u00a0m) on professional fields, a minimum of 10 yards (9.1\u00a0m) on college fields, and a minimum of 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) on high school fields. Goal posts are padded at the base, and orange ribbons are normally placed at the tip of each upright as indicators of wind strength and direction.[75][76][77]  The football itself is a prolate spheroid leather ball, similar to the balls used in rugby or Australian rules football.[78] To contain the compressed air within it, a pig's bladder was commonly used before the advent of artificial rubber inside the leather outer shell to sustain crushing forces.[79][80] At all levels of play, the football is inflated to 12+1\u20442 to 13+1\u20442\u00a0psi (86 to 93\u00a0kPa), or just under one atmosphere, and weighs 14 to 15 ounces (400 to 430\u00a0g);[77][81][82] beyond that, the exact dimensions vary slightly. In professional play the ball has a long axis of 11 to 11+1\u20444 inches (28 to 29\u00a0cm), a long circumference of 28 to 28+1\u20442 inches (71 to 72\u00a0cm), and a short circumference of 21 to 21+1\u20444 inches (53 to 54\u00a0cm).[83] In college and high school play the ball has a long axis of 10+7\u20448 to 11+7\u204416 inches (27.6 to 29.1\u00a0cm), a long circumference of 27+3\u20444 to 28+1\u20442 inches (70 to 72\u00a0cm), and a short circumference of 20+3\u20444 to 21+1\u20444 inches (53 to 54\u00a0cm).[77][81]  Football games last for a total of 60 minutes in professional and college play and are divided into two halves of 30 minutes and four quarters of 15 minutes.[84][85] High school football games are 48 minutes in length with two halves of 24 minutes and four quarters of 12 minutes.[86] The two halves are separated by a halftime period, and the first and third quarters are followed by a short break.[84][85][87] Before the game starts, the referee and each team's captain meet at midfield for a coin toss. The visiting team can call either \"heads\" or \"tails\"; the winner of the toss chooses whether to receive or kick off the ball or which goal they wish to defend. They can defer their choice until the second half. Unless the winning team decides to defer, the losing team chooses the option the winning team did not select\u2014to receive, kick, or select a goal to defend to begin the second half. Most teams choose to receive or defer, because choosing to kick the ball to start the game allows the other team to choose which goal to defend.[88] Teams switch goals following the first and third quarters.[89] If a down is in progress when a quarter ends, play continues until the down is completed.[90][91][92] If certain fouls are committed during play while time has expired, the quarter may be extended through an untimed down.[93]  Games last longer than their defined length due to play stoppages\u2014the average NFL game lasts slightly over three hours.[94] Time in a football game is measured by the game clock. An operator is responsible for starting, stopping and operating the game clock based on the direction of the appropriate official.[84][95] A separate play clock is used to show the amount of time within which the offense must initiate a play. The play clock is set to 25 seconds after certain administrative stoppages in play and to 40 seconds when play is proceeding without such stoppages. If the offense fails to start a play before the play clock reads \"00\", a delay of game foul is called on the offense.[90][96][97]  There are two main ways the offense can advance the ball: running and passing. In a typical play, the center passes the ball backwards and between their legs to the quarterback in a process known as the snap. The quarterback then either hands the ball off to a running back, throws the ball, or runs with it. The play ends when the player with the ball is tackled or goes out-of-bounds or a pass hits the ground without a player having caught it. A forward pass can be legally attempted only if the passer is behind the line of scrimmage; only one forward pass can be attempted per down.[70] As in rugby, players can also pass the ball backwards at any point during a play.[98] In the NFL, a down also ends immediately if the runner's helmet comes off.[99]  The offense is given a series of four plays, known as downs. If the offense advances ten or more yards in the four downs, they are awarded a new set of four downs. If they fail to advance ten yards, possession of the football is turned over to the defense. In most situations, if the offense reaches their fourth down they will punt the ball to the other team, which forces them to begin their drive from farther down the field; if they are in field goal range, they might attempt to score a field goal instead.[70] A group of officials, the chain crew, keeps track of both the downs and the distance measurements.[100] On television, a yellow line is electronically superimposed on the field to show the first down line to the viewing audience.[101]  There are two categories of kicks in football: scrimmage kicks, which can be executed by the offensive team on any down from behind or on the line of scrimmage,[104][105][106] and free kicks.[107][108][109] The free kicks are the kickoff, which starts the first and third quarters and overtime and follows a try attempt or a successful field goal; the safety kick follows a safety.[105][110][111]  On a kickoff, the ball is placed at the 35-yard line of the kicking team in professional and college play and at the 40-yard line in high school play. The ball may be drop kicked or place kicked. If a place kick is chosen, the ball can be placed on the ground or a tee; a holder may be used in either case. On a safety kick, the kicking team kicks the ball from their own 20-yard line. They can punt, drop kick or place kick the ball, but a tee may not be used in professional play. Any member of the receiving team may catch or advance the ball. The ball may be recovered by the kicking team once it has gone at least ten yards and has touched the ground or has been touched by any member of the receiving team.[112][113][114]  The three types of scrimmage kicks are place kicks, drop kicks, and punts. Only place kicks and drop kicks can score points.[66][67][68] The place kick is the standard method used to score points,[102] because the pointy shape of the football makes it difficult to reliably drop kick.[102][103] Once the ball has been kicked from a scrimmage kick, it can be advanced by the kicking team only if it is caught or recovered behind the line of scrimmage. If it is touched or recovered by the kicking team beyond this line, it becomes dead at the spot where it was touched.[115][116][117] The kicking team is prohibited from interfering with the receiver's opportunity to catch the ball. The receiving team has the option of signaling for a fair catch, which prohibits the defense from blocking into or tackling the receiver. The play ends as soon as the ball is caught, and the ball may not be advanced.[118][119][120]  Officials are responsible for enforcing game rules and monitoring the clock. All officials carry a whistle and wear black-and-white striped shirts and black hats except for the referee, whose hat is white. Each carries a weighted yellow flag that is thrown to the ground to signal that a foul has been called. An official who spots multiple fouls will throw their hat as a secondary signal.[121] Women can serve as officials; Sarah Thomas became the NFL's first female official in 2015.[122] The seven officials (of a standard seven-man crew; lower levels of play up to the college level use fewer officials) on the field are each tasked with a different set of responsibilities:[121]  Another set of officials, the chain crew, are responsible for moving the chains. The chains, consisting of two large sticks with a 10-yard-long chain between them, are used to measure for a first down. The chain crew stays on the sidelines during the game, but if requested by the officials they will briefly bring the chains on to the field to measure. A typical chain crew will have at least three people\u2014two members of the chain crew will hold either of the two sticks, while a third will hold the down marker. The down marker, a large stick with a dial on it, is flipped after each play to indicate the current down and is typically moved to the approximate spot of the ball. The chain crew system has been used for over 100 years and is considered an accurate measure of distance, rarely subject to criticism from either side.[100]  Football is a full-contact sport, and injuries are relatively common. Most injuries occur during training sessions, particularly ones that involve contact between players.[123] To try to prevent injuries, players are required to wear a set of equipment. At a minimum players must wear a football helmet and a set of shoulder pads, but individual leagues may require additional padding such as thigh pads and guards, knee pads, chest protectors, and mouthguards.[124][125][126] Most injuries occur in the lower extremities, particularly in the knee, but a significant number also affect the upper extremities. The most common types of injuries are strains, sprains, bruises, fractures, dislocations, and concussions.[123]  Repeated concussions (and possibly sub-concussive head impacts[127]) can increase a person's risk in later life for CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) and mental health issues such as dementia, Parkinson's disease, and depression.[128] Concussions are often caused by helmet-to-helmet or upper-body contact between opposing players, although helmets have prevented more serious injuries such as skull fractures.[129] Various programs are aiming to reduce concussions by reducing the frequency of helmet-to-helmet hits; USA Football's \"Heads Up Football\" program aims to reduce concussions in youth football by teaching coaches and players about the signs of a concussion, the proper way to wear football equipment and ensure it fits, and proper tackling methods that avoid helmet-to-helmet contact.[130] However, a study in the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine found that Heads Up Football was ineffective; the same study noted that more extensive reforms implemented by Pop Warner Little Scholars and its member teams were effective in significantly reducing concussion rates.[131]  A 2018 study performed by the VA Boston Healthcare System and the Boston University School of Medicine found that tackle football before age 12 was correlated with earlier onset of symptoms of CTE, but not with symptom severity. More specifically, each year a player played tackle football under age 12 predicted earlier onset of cognitive, behavioral, and mood problems by an average of two and a half years.[132][133][134]  The National Football League (NFL) and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) are the most popular football leagues in the United States.[135] The National Football League was founded in 1920[136] and has since become the largest and most popular sport in the United States.[137] The NFL has the highest average attendance of any sporting league in the world, with an average attendance of 66,960 during the 2011 NFL season.[138] The NFL championship game is called the Super Bowl, and is among the biggest events in club sports worldwide.[139] It is played between the champions of the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC), and its winner is awarded the Vince Lombardi Trophy.[140]  College football is the third-most popular sport in the United States, behind professional baseball and professional football.[141] The NCAA, the largest collegiate organization, is divided into three Divisions: Division I, Division II and Division III.[142] Division I football is further divided into two subdivisions: the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS).[143] The champions of each level of play are determined through NCAA-sanctioned playoff systems; while the champion of Division I-FBS was historically determined by various polls and ranking systems, the subdivision adopted a four-team playoff system in 2014.[144]  High school football is the most popular sport in the United States played by boys; over 1.1\u00a0million boys participated in the sport from 2007 to 2008 according to a survey by the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS). There is a stark contrast in youth football participation between boys and girls. Only one youth football league exists in the United States for girls, the GFL. The NFHS is the largest organization for high school football, with member associations in all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia. USA Football is the governing body for youth and amateur football,[145] and Pop Warner Little Scholars is the largest organization for youth football.[146]  The most successful league to directly compete with the NFL was the American Football League (AFL), which existed from 1960 to 1969. The AFL became a significant rival in 1964 before signing a five-year, US$36\u00a0million television deal with NBC. AFL teams began signing NFL players to contracts, and the league's popularity grew to challenge that of the NFL. The two leagues merged in the 1970 season, and all the AFL teams joined the NFL. An earlier league, the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), was in play from 1946 to 1949. After it had dissolved, two AAFC teams, the Cleveland Browns and the San Francisco 49ers, became members of the NFL; another member, the Baltimore Colts joined the league, but folded after just a year in the NFL.[147]  Other attempts to start rival leagues since the AFL merged with the NFL in 1970 have been far less successful, as professional football salaries and the NFL's television contracts began to escalate out of the reach of competitors and the NFL covered more of the larger cities. The World Football League (WFL) played for two seasons, in 1974 and 1975, but faced such severe monetary issues it could not pay its players. In its second and final season the WFL attempted to establish a stable credit rating, but the league disbanded before the season could be completed.[148] The United States Football League (USFL) operated for three seasons from 1983 to 1985. Originally not intended as a rival league, the entry of owners who sought marquee talent and to challenge the NFL led to an escalation in salaries and ensuing financial losses. A subsequent US$1.5\u00a0billion antitrust lawsuit against the NFL was successful in court, but the league was awarded only $1 in damages, which was automatically tripled to $3 under antitrust law.[149]  The original XFL, created in 2001 by Vince McMahon, lasted for only one season. Despite television contracts with NBC and UPN, and high expectations, the XFL suffered from low quality of play and poor reception for its use of tawdry professional wrestling gimmicks, which caused initially high ratings and attendance to collapse.[150] The XFL was rebooted in 2020.[151] However, after only five weeks of play, the league's operations slowly came to a close due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,[152] and filed for bankruptcy on April 13.[153] The United Football League (UFL) began in 2009 but folded after suspending its 2012 season amid declining interest and lack of major television coverage.[154] The Alliance of American Football lasted less than one season, unable to keep investors.[155]  American football leagues exist throughout the world, but the game has yet to achieve the international success and popularity of baseball and basketball.[156] It is not an Olympic sport, but it was a demonstration sport at the 1932 Summer Olympics.[157] At the international level, Canada, Mexico, and Japan are considered to be second-tier, while Austria, Germany, and France would rank among a third tier. These countries rank far below the United States, which is dominant at the international level.[158]  NFL Europa, the developmental league of the NFL, operated from 1991 to 1992 and then from 1995 to 2007. At the time of its closure, NFL Europa had five teams based in Germany and one in the Netherlands.[159] In Germany, the German Football League (GFL) has 16 teams and has operated for over 40 seasons, with the league's championship game, the German Bowl, closing out each season. The league operates in a promotion and relegation structure with German Football League 2 (GFL2), which also has 16 teams.[160] The BIG6 European Football League functions as a continental championship for Europe. The competition is contested between the top six European teams.[160]  The United Kingdom also operated several teams within NFL Europe during the League's tenure.[161] The resulting rise in popularity of the sport brought the NFL back to the country in 2007 where they now hold the NFL International Series in London, currently consisting of four regular season games.[162][163] The continuing interest and growth in both the sport and the series has led to the possible formation of a potential NFL franchise in London[164][165][166]  An American football league system already exists within the UK, the BAFANL, which has run under various guises since 1983. It currently has 70 teams operating across the tiers of contact football in which teams aim to earn promotion to the Division above, with the Premier Division teams competing to win the Britbowl, the annual British Football Bowl game that has been played since 1985.[167][168][169] In 2007, the British Universities American Football League was formed. From 2008, the BUAFL was officially associated with the National Football League (NFL), through its partner organization NFL UK.[170] In 2012, BUAFL's league and teams were absorbed into BUCS after American football became an official BUCS sport.[171] Over the period 2007 to 2014, the BUAFL grew from 42 teams and 2,460 participants to 75 teams and over 4,100 people involved.[172]  American football federations are present in Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania; a total of 75 national football federations exist as of 2023[update].[173] The International Federation of American Football (IFAF), an international governing body composed of continental federations, runs tournaments such as the IFAF World Championship, the IFAF Women's World Championship, the IFAF U-19 World Championship, and the Flag Football World Championship. The IFAF also organizes the annual International Bowl game.[174] The IFAF has received provisional recognition from the International Olympic Committee (IOC).[175] Several major obstacles hinder the IFAF goal of achieving status as an Olympic sport. These include the predominant participation of men in international play and the short three-week Olympic schedule. Large team sizes are an additional difficulty, due to the Olympics' set limit of 10,500 athletes and coaches. American football also has an issue with a lack of global visibility. Nigel Melville, the CEO of USA Rugby, noted that \"American football is recognized globally as a sport, but it's not played globally.\" To solve these concerns, major effort has been put into promoting flag football, a modified version of American football, at the international level.[158] Flag football has been shortlisted for appearance at the 2028 Summer Olympics, pending final approval by the International Olympic Committee.[176]  \"Baseball is still called the national pastime, but football is by far the more popular sport in American society\", according to ESPN.com's Sean McAdam.[177] In a 2014 poll conducted by Harris Interactive, professional football ranked as the most popular sport, and college football ranked third behind only professional football and baseball; 46% of participants ranked some form of the game as their favorite sport. Professional football has ranked as the most popular sport in the poll since 1985, when it surpassed baseball for the first time.[178] Professional football is most popular among those who live in the eastern United States and rural areas, while college football is most popular in the southern United States and among people with graduate and post-graduate degrees.[179] Football is also the most-played sport by high school and college athletes in the United States. As of 2022[update], the National Football Foundation reports nearly 1.04\u00a0million high-school athletes play the sport, with another 81,000 college athletes across both the NCAA and the NAIA;[3] in comparison, the second-most played sport, basketball, had around 920,000 participants in high school and 63,000 in college.[180]  The Super Bowl is the most popular single-day sporting event in the United States,[34] and is among the biggest club sporting events in the world in terms of TV viewership.[139] The NFL made approximately $12\u00a0billion in revenue in 2022.[181] Super Bowl games account for eight of the top ten most-watched broadcasts in American history; Super Bowl LVII, played on February 12, 2023, was watched by a record 115.1\u00a0million Americans,[182] and is second only to the Apollo 11 moon landing (125\u00a0million viewers).[183]  American football also plays a significant role in American culture. The day on which the Super Bowl is held is considered a de facto national holiday,[184] and in parts of the country like Texas, the sport has been compared to a religion.[185][186] Football is also linked to other holidays; New Year's Day is traditionally the date for several college football bowl games, including the Rose Bowl. However, if New Year's Day is on a Sunday, the bowl games are moved to another date so as not to conflict with the typical NFL Sunday schedule.[187] Thanksgiving football is another American tradition,[188] hosting many high school, college, and professional games.[189] Implicit rules such as playing through pain and sacrificing for the better of the team are promoted in football culture.[190]  In Canada, the game has a significant following. According to a 2013 poll, 21% of respondents said they followed the NFL \"very closely\" or \"fairly closely\", making it the third-most followed league behind the National Hockey League (NHL) and Canadian Football League (CFL).[191] American football also has a long history in Mexico, which was introduced to the sport in 1896. It was the second-most popular sport in Mexico in the 1950s, with the game being particularly popular in colleges.[192] The Los Angeles Times notes the NFL claims over 16\u00a0million fans in Mexico, which places the country third behind the U.S. and Canada.[193] American football is played in Mexico both professionally and as part of the college sports system.[194] A professional league, the Liga de F\u00fatbol Americano Profesional (LFA), was founded in 2016.[195]  Japan was introduced to the sport in 1934 by Paul Rusch, a teacher and Christian missionary who helped to establish football teams at three universities in Tokyo.[196] Play was halted during World War II by order of Emperor Hirohito, but the sport began growing in popularity again after the war.[197] As of 2010[update], there are more than 400 high school football teams in Japan, with over 15,000 participants, and over 100 teams play in the Kantoh Collegiate Football Association (KCFA).[196] The X-League is the largest American football league in Japan, and the largest American football league in the world to use a promotion-relegation system. Some teams in the X-League, like the Panasonic Impulse, are sponsored by corporations, and all Japanese players on these teams are employed by the corporation. The league operates in separate spring and fall seasons, with each team playing five games. The top eight teams make the playoffs, which are played in Tokyo Dome; the champion is determined by the Rice Bowl.[197]  Europe is a major target for the expansion of the game by football organizers. In the United Kingdom in the 1980s, the sport was popular, with the 1986 Super Bowl being watched by over four million people (about 1 out of every 14 Britons). Its popularity faded during the 1990s, coinciding with the establishment of the Premier League\u2014top level of the English football league system. According to BBC America, there is a \"social stigma\" surrounding American football in the UK, with many Brits feeling the sport has no right to call itself \"football\" due to the lack of emphasis on kicking.[198] Nonetheless, the sport has retained a following in the United Kingdom; the NFL operates a media network in the country, and since 2007 has hosted the NFL International Series in London. Super Bowl viewership has also rebounded, with over 4.4\u00a0million Britons watching Super Bowl XLVI.[199] The sport is played in European countries like Switzerland, which has American football clubs in every major city,[200] and Germany, where the sport has around 45,000 registered amateur players.[194]  In Brazil, football is a growing sport. It was generally unknown there until the 1980s when a small group of players began playing on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro. The sport grew gradually with 700 amateur players registering within 20 years. Games were played on the beach with modified rules and without the traditional football equipment due to its lack of availability in Brazil. Eventually, a tournament, the Carioca championship, was founded, with the championship Carioca Bowl played to determine a league champion. The country saw its first full-pad game of football in October 2008.[201] According to The Rio Times, the sport is one of the fastest-growing sports in Brazil and is almost as commonly played as soccer on the beaches of Copacabana and Botafogo.[202]  Football in Brazil is governed by the Confedera\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Futebol Americano (CBFA), which had over 5,000 registered players as of November 2013. The sport's increase in popularity has been attributed to games aired on ESPN, which began airing in Brazil in 1992 with Portuguese commentary.[203] The popularity and \"easy accessibility\" of non-contact versions of the sport in Brazil has led to a rise in participation by female players.[202] According to ESPN, the American football audience in Brazil increased 800% between 2013 and 2016. The network, along with Esporte Interativo, airs games there on cable television. Football is often associated in Brazil as being the sport of supermodel Gisele B\u00fcndchen's ex-husband Tom Brady. The NFL has expressed interest in having games in the country, and the Super Bowl has become a widely watched event in Brazil at bars and movie theaters.[204]  Further countries have also expressed interest in football to lesser degrees. The Arab world has expressed growing interest in American football, with many countries in the region being members of IFAF Asia. Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, which are not members of IFAF, have established their own domestic leagues. Egypt established two leagues for the sport, namely the Egyptian League of American Football and the Egyptian Federation of American Football, and Saudi Arabia hosts two teams based out of Jeddah and Yanbu respectively.[205][206] China has additionally been a target for the expansion of the sport, with the Mainland being the home of the Chinese National Football League as well as a growing audience of Super Bowl watchers. Three franchises are also based out of Hong Kong, which prior to the COVID-19 pandemic regularly played mainland teams. NFL games average 900,000 viewers in China, though the league has cited logistical challenges which would prevent teams from playing games akin to abroad games in European countries.[207]  Canadian football, the predominant form of football in Canada, is closely related to American football\u2014both sports developed from rugby and are considered to be the chief variants of gridiron football.[208] Although both games share a similar set of rules, there are several key rule differences: for example, in Canadian football the field measures 150 by 65 yards (137 by 59\u00a0m), including two 20-yard end zones (for a distance between goal lines of 110 yards),[209] teams have three downs instead of four, there are twelve players on each side instead of eleven,[210] fair catches are not allowed, and a rouge, worth a single point is scored if the offensive team kicks the ball out of the defense's end zone.[211] The Canadian Football League (CFL) is the major Canadian league and is the second-most popular sporting league in Canada, behind the National Hockey League.[211] The NFL and CFL had a formal working relationship from 1997 to 2006.[212] The CFL has a strategic partnership with two American football leagues, the German Football League (GFL) and the Liga de Futbol Americano Profesional (LFA).[213] The Canadian rules were developed separately from the American game.  Indoor football leagues constitute what The New York Times writer Mike Tanier described as the \"most minor of minor leagues.\" Leagues are unstable, with franchises regularly moving from one league to another or merging with other teams, and teams or entire leagues dissolving completely; games are only attended by a small number of fans, and most players are semi-professional athletes. The Indoor Football League is an example of a prominent indoor league.[214] The Arena Football League, which was founded in 1987 and ceased operations in 2019, was one of the longest-lived indoor football leagues.[215] In 2004, the league was called \"America's fifth major sport\" by ESPN The Magazine.[216]  There are several non-contact variants of football, such as flag football.[217] In flag football the ballcarrier is not tackled; instead, defenders aim to pull a flag tied around the ballcarrier's waist.[218] Another variant, touch football, simply requires the ballcarrier to be touched to be considered downed. Depending on the rules used, a game of touch football may require the ballcarrier be touched with either one or two hands to be considered downed.[219] "},{"title":"Goal (sports)","content":"  In sport, a goal may refer to either an instance of scoring, or to the physical structure or area where an attacking team must send the ball or puck in order to score points. The structure of a goal varies from sport to sport, and one is placed at or near each end of the playing field for each team to defend. For many sports, each goal structure usually consists of two vertical posts, called goal posts, supporting a horizontal crossbar. A goal line marked on the playing surface between the goal posts demarcates the goal area. Thus, the objective is to send the ball or puck between the goal posts, under or over the crossbar (depending on the sport), and across the goal line. Other sports may have other types of structures or areas where the ball or puck must pass through, such as the basketball hoop. Sports which feature goal scoring are also commonly known as invasion games.[1][2]  In several sports, sending the ball or puck into the opponent's goal structure or area is the sole method of scoring, and thus the final score is expressed in the total number of goals scored by each team. In other sports, a goal may be one of several scoring methods, and thus may be worth a different set number of points than the others.  In some sports, the goal is the sole method of scoring. In these sports, the final score is expressed as the number of goals scored by each team, with the winner being the team that accumulated more over the specified time period.  In other sports, a goal is not the sole method of scoring. In these sports, the goal is worth a set number of points but there are other methods of scoring which may be worth more, the same, or fewer points. In these sports, the score is expressed as the total number of points earned by each team.  In Australian rules football the score is expressed by listing the quantity of each team's \"goals\" and \"behinds\" followed by the total number of points.  The structure of a goal varies from sport to sport. Most often, it is a rectangular structure that is placed at each end of the playing field. Each structure usually consists of two vertical posts, called goal posts (side bar or uprights) supporting a horizontal crossbar. A goal line marked on the playing surface between the goal posts demarcates the goal area.  In some games, such as association football or hockey, the object is to pass the ball between the posts below the crossbar, while in others, such as those based on rugby, the ball must pass over the crossbar instead. In Gaelic football and hurling, in which the goalposts are similar to those used in rugby, the ball can be kicked either under the crossbar for a goal, or over the crossbar between the posts for a point. In Australian rules football, there is no crossbar but four uprights instead. In basketball, netball or korfball, goals are ring-shaped. The structure is often accompanied with an auxiliary net, which stops or slows down the ball when a goal is scored. In netball, a single post at each end of the court supports a horizontal hoop that the ball must fall through. In basketball, the hoop and net used for scoring can be supported on a post or mechanism at each end, or on structures attached directly to the wall.  The goal is the only method of scoring in several games. In each of these cases, the winner is the team that scores the most goals within the specified time.  In association football, the goal is the only method of scoring. It is also used to refer to the scoring structure. An attempt on goal is referred to as a \"shot\". To score a goal, the ball must pass completely over the goal line between the goal posts and under the crossbar and no rules may be violated on the play (such as touching the ball with the hand or arm).[3] See also offside.  The goal structure is defined as a frame 24\u00a0feet (7.32\u00a0m) wide by 8\u00a0feet (2.44\u00a0m) tall. In most organized levels of play a net is attached behind the goal frame to catch the ball and indicate that a goal has been scored; but the Laws of the Game do not mandate the use of a net and only require that any net used not interfere with the goalkeeper.[4]  In bandy, which has much of its structure from association football, the only way of scoring is to make a goal and the goal is also used to refer to the scoring structure. If neither of the teams has scored during a match, or if both teams have made the same number of goals, there is a draw. If not otherwise decided in the Bandy Playing Rules set up by the Federation of International Bandy,[5] an approved goal is made when the ball is played in a regular manner and the whole ball has passed the inner definition of the goal line between the two goal posts and the cross-bar. This is stated in section 9 of the Rules. A goal can be made directly from a stroke-off, penalty-shot, a free-stroke, a face-off or a corner stroke. Centered at each short-line of the bandy field is a 3.5\u00a0m (11\u00a0ft) wide and 2.1\u00a0m (6\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in) high goal cage, regulated to size, form, material and other properties in section 1.4 of the Bandy Playing Rules. The cage has a net to stop the ball when it has crossed the goal-line. The cage shall be of an approved model. In front of the goal cage is a half-circular penalty area with a 17\u00a0m (56\u00a0ft) radius. A penalty spot is located 12 metres (39\u00a0ft) in front of the goal and there are two free-stroke spots at the penalty area line, each surrounded by a 5\u00a0m (16\u00a0ft) circle.  The goal structure in field hockey is 3.66 metres (12.0\u00a0ft) wide by 2.14 metres (7.0\u00a0ft) tall. Like association football, a goal is scored when the ball passes completely over the goal line under the crossbar and between the goal posts. Nets are required to hold the ball in.[6] A goal is only scored if shot from with a semicircle 14.63 metres (48.0\u00a0ft) from the goal.[6]  A goal in handball is scored when the ball is thrown completely over the goal line, below the crossbar and between the goal posts.[7] The goal structure in team handball is 2\u00a0metres high and 3\u00a0metres wide. A net is required to catch the ball.[7]  In ice hockey, the puck must be put completely over the goal line between the posts and under the bar either off an offensive player's stick or off any part of a defensive player's body. The puck may not be kicked, batted, or thrown into the goal, though a goal may be awarded if the puck is inadvertently deflected off an offensive player's skate or body into the goal.[citation needed] The goal structure is a frame 4 feet (1.2\u00a0m) tall and 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m) wide with a net attached. In most higher levels of play the goal structure is attached to the ice surface by flexible pegs and will break away for safety when hit by a player. The goal is placed within the playing surface, and players may play the puck behind the goal.[8]  Lacrosse goals are scored when the ball travels completely past the goal line. Goals can be disallowed if there is an infraction by the offensive team. The goal in lacrosse is 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m) tall and 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m) wide and a net is used to prevent the ball from reentering the field of play. Lacrosse goals are not positioned on the end boundary line; play often occurs behind the goal.[9]  In netball, a goal is scored when the ball is shot through a goal ring on a pole.  In polo, a goal is scored if the ball passes completely between the goal posts, regardless of how far off the ground the ball is.  The ball must be between the goal posts or the imaginary lines extending above the inside edges of the posts.  A ball passing directly over a goal post does not score a goal.[10]  The goal structure in Polo consists of two poles, at least 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) high and exactly 8 yards apart.  There is no crossbar and no net is required. The height at which a goal may be scored is infinite.[10]  In Hardcourt Bike Polo, a goal is scored if the ball passes completely over the goal line and the shot originated as a \"shot\" as defined by the rules. A shot is made with either end of the mallet head similar to swinging a hammer whereas a shuffle is made with the long side like pushing a broom. Traditionally when using a non-netted goal such as two traffic cones the play is continued if the ball is shuffled through the goal of pass through the goal from the opposite direction. These non-netted goals are no long regulation[11][12] in competitive play but are common depending on the resources of a club.  In shinty, a goal is scored if the ball goes over the goal line and under the crossbar. A goal can only be scored with a stick called a \"caman\"; no goal is scored if the ball is kicked, carried, or propelled by an attacking player's hand or arm.  A goal in water polo is scored when the ball passes completely across the goal line, under the crossbar and between the goal posts.  A goal may be scored through contact with any part of the attacker's body except a clenched fist.[13] The goal structure in water polo is dependent upon the depth of the water.  The goal mouth measures 3\u00a0metres across and is either 0.9\u00a0metres above the surface of the water or 2.4\u00a0metres above the floor of the pool, whichever is higher.  Nets are required.[13]  The following games have more than one possible method of scoring where the goal is the primary method, i.e. the method that scores the most points. In most cases the score is shown as the number of goals, plus the number of secondary scores (usually 1 point), plus the total number of points. The side with the higher number of total points is the winner.  In Australian rules football a goal is scored when the ball is kicked by an attacking player completely between the two tall goal posts. To be awarded a goal, the ball may not contact or pass over the goal post, or touch any player on any part of the body other than the foot or lower leg of an attacker. In such cases, the score is a behind (1 point). The ball may be punted, drop kicked, or kicked off the ground (soccered). The ball may cross the goal line at any height from ground level up and may bounce before crossing the line. A goal scores six points. The behind, which scores one point; is awarded if the ball passes between the point posts or is not awarded a goal by the above provisions when passing through the goal posts.[14] The goal structure consists of two posts at least 6\u00a0metres in height and spaced 6.4\u00a0metres apart. There is no crossbar and no net.[14]  The primary object of basketball is to score by shooting (i.e., throwing) the ball into a goal officially called the basket. A basket is scored when the ball passes completely through the basket ring from above; however, the number of points scored with each basket depends on where on the court the ball was shot from, and a team does not necessarily need to score the most baskets to win the game. Basketball scores are expressed in total points.[15]  A basket scored during normal play is called a field goal and is worth two points if shot from within or on the three-point line, and three points if shot from beyond the three-point line. The three-point line's distance from the basket varies by level. Points are also awarded to the shooting team if the defensive team commits goaltending or basket interference while the ball is in flight towards the basket or is directly over it.  A basketball team can also score by free throws, which score one point each. Free throws are awarded to a team after the opponent commits a foul in certain scenarios. The player taking the free throws (usually the player who was fouled) is entitled to take a specified number of shots unopposed with both feet behind the free throw line.  The basket consists of a metal ring 18 inches (46\u00a0cm) in internal diameter, suspended horizontally 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) above the floor such that the center of the ring is equidistant from each sideline and 5\u00a0feet 3\u00a0inches (1.60\u00a0m) from the end line. The basket ring has a net attached below to briefly check the ball's downward progress and indicate a score. The ring is fastened to a rectangular backboard 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m) wide by 3.5 feet (1.1\u00a0m) tall,[16][17] though in lower levels of play or recreational use the backboard may be smaller and\/or fan-shaped. The entire structure is supported from behind and anchored to the floor beyond the end line at higher levels of play; the structure may be anchored to a wall or ceiling at lower levels of play.[17] The ring, net, and the front, top, bottom, and sides of the backboard are all considered inbounds, while the back of the backboard and the support structure \u2013 even those parts suspended over inbounds areas of the court \u2013 are considered out of bounds.[citation needed]  In Gaelic football a goal is scored when the ball passes completely beyond the goal line, between the goal posts and under the cross bar. The ball can be played with the hands, but a goal cannot be scored by hand. A ball travelling between the goal posts and over the cross bar is awarded one pointed called an \"over\". Overs are the most common scoring method with goals heavily defended.[18] A goal is worth three points.  In hurling the ball must pass completely beyond the goal line.  The ball may be played by any legal method except by the hand of the attacker.  A ball in flight may be deflected into the goal off the hand of an attacker. Hurling and Gaelic football use the same goal structure.  It is a 6.4\u00a0meter wide frame with a net attached.  The goal posts are at least 6\u00a0meters high, and the crossbar is 2.44\u00a0meters above the ground.  A goal is scored when the ball crosses below the crossbar and a point is scored when the ball passes above it.[18]  At each end of the field in the following games, there is both a marked scoring area and a separate goal post structure. In these games, the term \"goal\" is only used for the secondary scoring method of putting the ball through the goal post structure.  In American and Canadian football, there is a scoring area marked at each end of the field called an end zone, and a separate goal post structure.  The primary method of scoring is a touchdown. Whether running, passing, returning a kickoff or punt, or recovering a turnover, a team scores a touchdown by advancing the ball into the end zone. A touchdown scores 6 points in both versions of the sport. The front line of the end zone is the \"goal line\", its back line is the \"end line\", and each corner is marked with a pylon. Each end zone in American football is about 10 by 53.33 yards (9.14\u00a0m \u00d7\u00a048.76\u00a0m) wide, while each end zone in Canadian football is about 20 by 65 yards (18\u00a0m \u00d7\u00a059\u00a0m) wide. Unlike other sports which require the ball\/puck to pass completely over the goal line to count as a score, both Canadian and American football merely need any part of the ball to break the vertical plane of the outer edge of the goal line to count as a touchdown.  A field goal is a secondary method of scoring; it is scored when the ball is place kicked or drop kicked completely over the crossbar and between or directly over the goal posts. A field goal scores 3 points in both versions of the sport. In the American game, the now rarely used fair catch kick, if successfully made, also scores 3 points. A goal kicked during a try following a touchdown is worth one point.[19][20] These are the only methods of putting the ball through the goal posts that award points to the kicking team; no points are scored if the ball is punted or thrown through the goal posts, or if the ball goes through the goal posts on a kickoff (except, in the latter case, in indoor American football, where some leagues award a single point).  In both sports, the goal structure consists of a horizontal crossbar suspended ten feet (3.05\u00a0m) above the ground and vertical goal posts (\"uprights\") placed 18\u00a0feet 6\u00a0inches (5.64\u00a0m) apart and extending at least 35 feet (10.67\u00a0m) above the crossbar. In lower levels of play the goal posts may be placed further apart and\/or not extend as far above the crossbar; for example, in high school football the posts are 23\u00a0feet 4\u00a0inches (7.11\u00a0m) apart. NFL and CFL rules mandate that a ribbon be attached to the top of each goal post.[21][22] Goals are centered on the field, but on different lines: in American football, they lie on the \"end line\" (far end of the end zone) and in Canadian football, on the \"goal line\" (beginning of the end zone). A retractable net may be placed behind the goal posts, well beyond the field of play, to prevent the ball from entering spectator areas.  Until the mid-1960s, the goal posts were similar in design to rugby posts, with the crossbar and uprights supported by stanchions installed directly underneath the uprights (in the shape of the letter 'H'). A transitional design from this time retained the twin set of stanchions but placed them behind the crossbar. In this design, the crossbar and uprights were supported by a set of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal stanchions behind each upright. This design was last used professionally in the first Super Bowl in January 1967. The modern goal posts supported by a single \"goose-necked\" stanchion (in the shape of the letter 'Y') made their debut in the 1966 CFL playoffs and were adopted by all three professional leagues (CFL, NFL, and AFL) the following year, with many (but not all) college teams following suit in the years since.[23] The NFL, which merged with the AFL in 1970, had its crossbar over the goal line until\u00a01974.  In arena football, a field goal also scores three points, unless it is drop kicked, in which case it scores four points.[24] The goal structure in arena football is much smaller than the outdoor game; it consists of a crossbar 15 feet (4.57\u00a0m) above the playing surface and 9.5 feet (2.90\u00a0m) wide; this size is also used for most other indoor leagues as well.  Uniquely in arena football, the goal posts are attached to nets on either side of the crossbar which are taut to allow the ball to rebound back onto the field of play. The nets are 30 feet (9.14\u00a0m) wide and 37 feet (11.28\u00a0m) high. These nets do not represent a scoring area, but keep the ball in play and prevent it from entering the crowd.[24]  Canadian football also offers a secondary form of goal, the rouge or single point; it is awarded if a ball enters the end zone by way of any kick (either a missed field goal or a punt) and is not returned by the opposing team; this is not offered in American football (such a play results in a touchback instead).    In both rugby codes, there is a scoring area marked at each end of the field called an in-goal area, and a separate H-shaped goal structure. The primary scoring method is a try, worth 5 points in rugby union and worth 4 points in rugby league. A try is scored by grounding the ball in the in-goal area.  A goal is scored in either rugby code by place kicking or drop kicking a ball over the crossbar and between the uprights of H-shaped goalposts.[25][26] The goalposts are positioned centrally on the goal line (the front line of the in-goal area). The crossbar is 3 metres (9.8\u00a0ft) from the ground; the uprights are 5.5 metres (18\u00a0ft) apart in rugby league and 5.6 metres (18\u00a0ft) in rugby union.  In the early years of rugby, only goals counted in scoring, and a \"try\" counted only if \"converted\" into a goal. The official name \"goal from a try\" for a converted try persisted until 1979.  Celebrating the scoring of a goal is common. It is normally performed by the goalscorer, and may involve his or her teammates, the manager or coaching staff and\/or the supporters of the team. Whilst referring to the celebration of a goal in general, the term can also be applied to specific actions, such as a player removing his shirt or performing a somersault.  The expression \"moving the goalposts\", which means to make a set of goals more difficult just as they are being met, is often used in business but is derived from association football.[28] It is commonly used to imply bad faith on the part of those setting goals for others to meet, by arbitrarily making additional demands just as the initial ones are about to be met.  In business, the concept is more abstract, with some performance measure or target being set as a goalpost while achieving the target is often known as achieving a goal. "},{"title":"Fouls and misconduct (association football)","content":"  In the sport of association football, fouls and misconduct are acts committed by players which are deemed by the referee to be unfair and are subsequently penalised. An offence may be a foul, misconduct or both depending on the nature of the offence and the circumstances in which it occurs. Fouls and misconduct are addressed in Law 12 of the Laws of the Game. A foul is an unfair act by a player, deemed by the referee to contravene the game's laws, that interferes with the active play of the match. Fouls are punished by the award of a free kick (possibly a penalty kick) to the opposing team. A list of specific offences that can be fouls are detailed in Law 12 of the Laws of the Game (other infractions, such as technical infractions at restarts, are not deemed to be fouls); these mostly concern unnecessarily aggressive physical play and the offence of handling the ball. An infringement is classified as a foul when it meets all the following conditions:  For example, a player striking the referee or a teammate is not a foul, but is misconduct.[1]  Misconduct is any conduct by a player that is deemed by the referee to warrant a disciplinary sanction (caution or dismissal). Misconduct may include acts which are, additionally, fouls. Unlike fouls, misconduct may occur at any time, including when the ball is out of play, during half-time and before and after the game, and both players and substitutes may be sanctioned for misconduct.  Misconduct will result in the player either receiving a caution (indicated by a yellow card) or being dismissed (\"sent off\") from the field (indicated by a red card).[1]:\u200a38\u200a A dismissed player cannot be replaced; their team is required to play the remainder of the game with one fewer player. A second caution results in the player being dismissed. The referee has considerable discretion in applying the Laws; in particular, the offence of unsporting behaviour may be used to deal with most events that violate the spirit of the game, even if they are not listed as specific offences.[1]:\u200a123\u200a  The system of cautioning and dismissal has existed in the Laws since 1881.[2] Association football was the first sport to introduce penalty cards to indicate the referee's decisions; a practice since adopted by many other sports. The first major use of the cards was in the 1970 FIFA World Cup, but they were not made mandatory at all levels until 1992.[3]  The rules divide fouls into two categories depending on the type of free kick awarded to the opposition, either a direct or indirect free kick.  Direct free kicks offences are the more common type of foul. If a direct free kick is awarded in the penalty area of the offending player's team, a penalty kick is awarded.[4]:\u200a117\u200a  The majority of fouls concern contact between opponents. Although contact between players is a part of the game, the Laws prohibit most forceful contact, meaning that, unlike other football codes, a tackle in association football is required to be predominantly directed against the ball rather than the player in possession of it. Specifically the rules prohibit charging, jumping at, kicking (or attempting to kick), pushing, striking (or attempting to strike), tripping (or attempting to trip), tackling or challenging an opponent in a manner considered to be careless, reckless or \"using excessive force\". Being careless makes it an offence, being reckless makes it a cautionable offence and using excessive force makes it a sending-off offence. Such classification of contact is a matter of judgement for the referee.  The handball offence is also penalised with a direct free kick. Players in association football are prohibited from touching the ball below the shoulder while the ball is in play, with the exception of the goalkeeper in their penalty area. When determining a handball offence, not every touch of the player's hand\/arm to the ball is an offence. The area of the arm in line with the bottom of the armpit and above is allowed to touch the ball.[5] Unavoidable accidental contact is not penalised - such as if the ball is struck against a player's arm at short range and the player could not have reasonably avoided the contact. However, if the player has positioned their arm so as to make their body \"unnaturally bigger\" and contact occurs, this is considered handball. Additionally, if a player scores in the opponent's goal with their hand or arm, even if accidental and unavoidable, this is considered handball and the goal does not stand.[4]:\u200a98\u200a The goalkeeper also has the same rules regarding handballs outside of the penalty area. If the goalkeeper handles the ball inside the penalty area when not allowed to do so, an indirect free kick is awarded.[5]\u00a0  Direct free kicks are also awarded for holding an opponent, impeding them with contact, biting or spitting at other persons, throwing an object (other than the ball) at an opponent or match official, or making contact with the ball with a held object.  An indirect free kick is awarded if a player:  An indirect free kick is awarded if a goalkeeper, inside their penalty area, commits any of the following offences:  An indirect free kick is also awarded if an offside offence occurs, though offside is not considered a foul and will never be punished by a caution or dismissal.  Indirect free kicks are taken from the place where the offence occurred, even if it was inside the offending player's penalty area. If the offence took place inside their goal area the indirect free kick is taken from the nearest point on the goal area line which runs parallel to the goal line.[4]:\u200a113\u200a  Not all infractions of the Laws are fouls. Non-foul infractions may be dealt with as technical infractions (e.g. as breaching the rules governing the restarts of play) or misconduct (these are punishable by a caution or sending-off). Persistent infringement of the Laws is an offence for which the player may be cautioned.[1]:\u200a38\u200a    The referee may consider serious or persistent offences to be misconduct worthy of an official caution or dismissal from the game. Association football was the first sport to use coloured cards to indicate these actions.[6]  A yellow card is shown by the referee to indicate that a player has been officially cautioned.[1]:\u200a38\u200a The player's details are then recorded by the referee in a small notebook; hence a caution is also known as a \"booking\". A player who has been cautioned may continue playing in the game; however, a player who receives a second caution in a match is sent off (shown the yellow card again, and then a red card). Law 12 of the Laws of the Game lists the types of offences and misconduct that may result in a caution. Players can be cautioned and shown a yellow card if they commit the following offences:   There are also two offences which apply in matches using the video assistant referee system:  What constitutes cautionable unsporting behaviour is generally at the referee's discretion, though Law 12 lists a number of examples.[4]:\u200a103\u200a These include simulation intended to deceive the referee, or attempting to score by handling the ball. Fouls which are committed recklessly or fouls which are committed with the intention of breaking up a promising attack are also considered unsporting behaviour and punishable with a yellow card. Fouls which are committed with excessive force, however, or which are deliberately committed to deny an obvious goalscoring opportunity for the player fouled (i.e. a professional foul),[8] are punishable by a red card.  The Laws state that goals may be celebrated, but that such celebrations should not be \"excessive\". Removing one's shirt or covering  one's face with the shirt will result in a caution. Players may also be cautioned for climbing onto a perimeter fence or approaching\/entering spectator areas in a manner that causes safety and\/or security concerns.[9]  In most tournaments, the accumulation of a certain number of yellow cards over several matches results in a suspension of the offending player for a certain number of subsequent matches, the exact number of cards and matches varying by jurisdiction. In the UEFA Champions League, for instance, accumulating two yellow cards in a stage of the tournament will lead to a one-game suspension. In such situations players have often been suspected of (and occasionally even admitted to) deliberately incurring a second booking in a tournament when the following game is of little importance, thus resetting their yellow card tally to zero for subsequent games (known as \"cleaning cards\"). However, while technically within the rules of competition, this is considered unsportsmanlike and UEFA have on occasion acted on such choices and have given additional fines and or suspensions to the players and managers involved. Sergio Ramos in 2019 picked up extra Champions League suspensions after publicly suggesting during interviews that a yellow card that he accrued was on purpose for card cleaning.[10][11][12]  In 2017 IFAB approved temporary dismissals (sin-bins) for cautionable offences similar to that seen in other sports; however, this is only permitted for youth, veterans, disability and grassroots football. Competitions' use of this system\u2014rather than normal yellow cards\u2014is optional, and there are variations in how it can be implemented. For 90-minute games, the length of the temporary dismissal is 10 minutes.[13]  A red card is shown by a referee to signify that a player must be sent off.[1]:\u200a38\u200a A player who has been sent off is required to leave the field of play immediately, must take no further part in the game and cannot be replaced by a substitute, forcing their team to play with one fewer player. If a team's goalkeeper receives a red card another player is required to assume goalkeeping duties, so teams usually substitute another goalkeeper for an outfield player if they still have substitutes available.  Law 12 of the Laws of the Game lists the categories of misconduct for which a player may be sent off. These are:  In matches using the Video Assistant Referee system, the list also includes entering the video operation room.[4]:\u200a105\u200a  Serious foul play is a foul committed using excessive force (i.e., \"the player has far exceeded the necessary use of force and is in danger of injuring his opponent when challenging for the ball and when it is in play.\").[1]:\u200a117\u200a Violent conduct is distinct from serious foul play in that it may be committed by any player, substitute, or substituted player against any person, e.g., teammates, match officials, or spectators.[1]:\u200a127\u200a  Once a player has been sent off, they are not permitted to stay in the team's technical area and must leave the immediate field or playing area.[14]  Should a team's on-field players receive a total of 5 red cards, it will be unable to field the required minimum of 7 players, resulting in the game being abandoned.  Starting in August 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic, IFAB and the Football Association stated that any player who deliberately coughs at others will receive a straight red card. Less severe incidents are classified as \"unsporting behaviour\" and will result in a yellow card.[15]  The practice of cautioning and excluding players who make serious breaches of the rules has been part of the Laws of the Game since 1881.[16] However, the practice of using language-neutral coloured cards to indicate these actions did not follow for almost 90 years.  The idea originated with British football referee Ken Aston.[6] Aston had been appointed to the FIFA Referees' Committee and was responsible for all referees at the 1966 FIFA World Cup. In the quarter finals, England met Argentina at Wembley Stadium. After the match, newspaper reports stated that referee Rudolf Kreitlein had cautioned both Bobby and Jack Charlton, as well as sending off Argentine Antonio Ratt\u00edn. The referee had not made his decision clear during the game, and England manager Alf Ramsey approached FIFA for post-match clarification. This incident started Aston thinking about ways to make a referee's decisions clearer to both players and spectators. Aston realised that a colour-coding scheme based on the same principle as used on traffic lights (yellow - caution, red - stop) would traverse language barriers and clarify whether a player had been cautioned or expelled.[6] As a result, yellow cards to indicate a caution and red cards to indicate an expulsion were used for the first time in the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico (though no players were sent off in that tournament). The use of penalty cards has since been adopted and expanded by several sporting codes, with each sport adapting the idea to its specific set of rules or laws.  Until 1992, a player committing a second bookable offence was shown only a red card; in that year, the IFAB mandated that a yellow card be shown before the red card.[17] Lothar Matth\u00e4us had previously proposed a \"lilac card\" to distinguish such cases from the more serious \"straight red card\" offence.[18]  With the help of the video assistant referee, it is now possible to upgrade a yellow card to a red card after an on-field review of the infraction. In that case, the referee will show the yellow card, make a no-good gesture, and show the red card to the offending player.  Fouls are very common occurrences in games. For example, the 2012\u201313 football season saw fouls-per-game rates in the major European leagues ranging from 23 in the Premier League to 32 in the Bundesliga.[19]  Yellow cards are less common, though a typical game will feature a few \u2013 at the 2014 FIFA World Cup there were, on average, about three cautions per game. Dismissals are much rarer; that same tournament saw an average of 0.2 red cards per match.[20]  The referee has a very large degree of discretion as to the enforcement of the 17 Laws including determining which acts constitute cautionable offences under the very broad categories. For this reason, refereeing decisions are sometimes controversial. Some Laws may specify circumstances under which a caution should or must be given, and numerous directives to referees also provide additional guidance. The encouragement for referees to use their common sense is known colloquially as \"Law 18\".[21]  According to the principle of advantage, play should be allowed to continue when an offence occurs and the non-offending team will benefit from ongoing play. If the anticipated advantage does not ensue within a few seconds, the referee will stop play and restart with a direct or indirect free kick or a penalty kick (depending on the offence).[22]  If the ball is out of play when an infraction of the Laws of the Game occurs, play is restarted according to the reason the ball became out of play before the infraction. (Any infraction of the Laws of the Game that occurs while the ball is out of play can be misconduct, but is not a foul.)  If the misconduct occurs when the ball is in play, play need not be stopped to administer a caution or a dismissal, as these may be done at the next stoppage of play (this is usually the case when the opposing team would gain an advantage in having play continue). When this is the case, play is restarted according to the reason for the ball becoming out of play, e.g. a throw-in if play stopped due to the ball crossing a touchline.  If play is stopped to administer a caution or dismissal:  In 2019 the IFAB approved the use of red and yellow cards for team officials and since then, in most competitions, the system operates in much the same way as the card system for players (i.e. if a team official, such as the manager or a coach, receives two yellow cards they are given a red). Depending on the seriousness of the offence, that official then may be subject to a subsequent touchline ban, a fine and\/or some other form of additional punishment - depending on the rules of their competition and national football association.    Up until this law change, team officials such as managers and coaches were originally not subject to the cautionable and sending-off offences listed above, as these apply only to players, substitutes, and substituted players. As such, they were not physically shown cards if they committed an offence. However, according to Law 5 the referee could caution or dismiss team officials from their technical areas and immediate surroundings (which was still sometimes colloquially referred to as a \"sending off\").  Many football leagues and federations impose off-field penalties for players who accumulate a certain number of cautions in a season, tournament or phase of a tournament. Typically, these take the form of suspending a player from playing in his team's next game(s) after reaching a particular number of cautions. Such off-field penalties are determined by league rules, and not by the Laws of the Game. A unique rule regarding this penalty was introduced by Major League Soccer in its reserve league of MLS Next Pro at the halfway point of Next Pro's inaugural 2022 season. A player who is sent off serves his suspension in his team's next match against the same opponent.[23]  Similarly, a direct red card usually also results in additional sanctions, most commonly in the form of suspensions from playing for a number of future games, although financial fines may also be imposed. The exact punishments are determined by tournament or competition rules, and not by the Laws of the Game. FIFA in particular has been adamant that a red card in any football competition must result in the guilty player being suspended for at least the next game, with the only grounds of appeal being mistaken identity.[24]  At the 2006 FIFA World Cup, any player receiving two yellow cards during the three group stage matches, or two yellow cards in the knockout stage matches had to serve a one-match suspension for the next game. A single yellow card did not carry over from the group stage to the knockout stages. Should the player pick up his second yellow during the team's final group match, he would miss the Round of 16 if his team qualified for it. However, suspensions due to yellow cards do not carry beyond the World Cup finals.  For the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the rules were changed so that any player who received two yellow cards between the beginning of the tournament and the end of the quarterfinal round (instead of the end of the group stage matches) would serve a one-match suspension for the next game. As a result, only players that received a red card (whether directly or after a second booking) in the semifinal game would not be able to play in the final.  In some league\/group competitions, a team's fair play record, as measured by the total number of yellow and red cards acquired by a team, may be used as a potential tie-breaking method to determine final table position. This method was used for the first time in the World Cup's history in 2018, where Japan advanced to the round of 16 over Senegal in Group H after being tied in every other category (Japan received four yellow cards in the group, fewer than Senegal's six).[25][26] "},{"title":"Alba","content":"    Alba (\/\u02c8\u00e6lb\u0259, \u02c8\u00e6lv\u0259\/ AL-b\u0259, AL-v\u0259,[1][2] Scottish Gaelic: [\u02c8al\u032a\u02e0\u0259p\u0259] \u24d8) is the Scottish Gaelic name for Scotland. It is also, in English-language historiography, used to refer to the polity of Picts and Scots united in the ninth century as the Kingdom of Alba,[3] until it developed into the Kingdom of Scotland of the late Middle Ages following the absorption of Strathclyde and English-speaking Lothian in the 12th century.[4] It is cognate with the Irish term Alba (gen. Alban, dat. Albain) and the Manx term Nalbin, the two other Goidelic Insular Celtic languages, as well as contemporary words used in Cornish (Alban) and Welsh (Yr Alban), both of which are Brythonic Insular Celtic languages. The third surviving Brythonic language, Breton, instead uses Bro-Skos, meaning 'country of the Scots'. In the past, these terms were names for Great Britain as a whole, related to the Brythonic name Albion.  The term first appears in classical texts as \u1f08\u03bb\u03b2\u03af\u03c9\u03bd Alb\u00ed\u014dn[5] or \u1f08\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u0390\u03c9\u03bd Alou\u00ed\u014dn (in Ptolemy's writings in Greek), and later as Albion in Latin documents. Historically, the term refers to Britain as a whole and is ultimately based on the Indo-European root for \"white\".[6] It later came to be used by Gaelic speakers in the form of Alba (dative Albainn, genitive Albann, now obsolete) as the name given to the former kingdom of the Picts which, when first used in this sense (around the time of king Causant\u00edn mac \u00c1eda (Constantine II, 943\u2013952)), had expanded. The region of Breadalbane (Br\u00e0ghad Albann, the upper part of \"Alba\") takes its name from it as well.  As time passed, that kingdom incorporated other territories to its south. It became re-Latinised in the High Medieval period as \"Albania\" (it is unclear whether it may ultimately share the same etymon as the modern Albania). This latter word was employed mainly by Celto-Latin writers, and most famously by Geoffrey of Monmouth. It was this word which passed into Middle English as Albany, although very rarely was this used for the Kingdom of Scotland, but rather for the notional Duchy of Albany. It is from the latter that Albany, the capital of the US state of New York, and Albany, Western Australia, take their names.  It also appears in the anglicised literary form of Albyn, as in Byron's Childe Harold:  BBC Alba, a television channel broadcasting mainly in Scottish Gaelic, was launched in September 2008 as a joint venture between the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and Gaelic company MG Alba. A new version of Runrig's song Alba (originally on their album, The Cutter and the Clan) was featured on the channel's launch.  In the mid-1990s, the Celtic League started a campaign to have the word \"Alba\" on the Scottish football and rugby tops. Since 2005, the SFA have supported the use of Scottish Gaelic by adding Alba on the back of the official team strip.[7] However, as of 2008, the SRU is still being lobbied to have Alba added to the national rugby union strip.[8]  In 2007, the then Scottish Executive re-branded itself as \"The Scottish Government\" and started to use a bilingual logo with the Gaelic name Riaghaltas na h-Alba. However, the Gaelic version from the outset had always been Riaghaltas na h-Alba.[clarification needed] The Scottish Parliament, likewise, uses the Gaelic name P\u00e0rlamaid na h-Alba.  A new welcome sign on the historic A7 route into Scotland was erected in 2009, with the text F\u00e0ilte gu Alba.  Phrases such as Alba gu br\u00e0th may be used as a catch-phrase or rallying cry. It was used in the movie Braveheart as William Wallace encouraged the troops at the Battle of Stirling Bridge.  In March 2021, former first minister of Scotland and leader of the SNP Alex Salmond launched the pro-independence Alba Party, set to contest the 2021 Scottish Parliament elections.[9] "},{"title":"Wales","content":"  \u2013\u00a0in Europe\u00a0(green &\u00a0dark grey)\u2013\u00a0in the United Kingdom\u00a0(green) Wales (Welsh: Cymru [\u02c8k\u0259m.r\u0268] \u24d8) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It is bordered by the Irish Sea to the north and west, England to the east, the Bristol Channel to the south, and the Celtic Sea to the south-west. As of the 2021 census, it had a population of 3,107,494.[1] It has a total area of 21,218 square kilometres (8,192\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and over 2,700 kilometres (1,680\u00a0mi) of coastline.[7] It is largely mountainous with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa), its highest summit.[13] The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate. The capital and largest city is Cardiff.  A distinct Welsh culture emerged among the Celtic Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century, and Wales was briefly united under Gruffydd ap Llywelyn in 1055. After over 200 years of war, the conquest of Wales by King Edward I of England was completed by 1283, though Owain Glynd\u0175r led the Welsh Revolt against English rule in the early 15th century, and briefly re-established an independent Welsh state with its own national parliament (Welsh: senedd). In the 16th century the whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542. Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century. Welsh Liberalism, exemplified in the early 20th century by David Lloyd George, was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party. Welsh national feeling grew over the century: a nationalist party, Plaid Cymru, was formed in 1925, and the Welsh Language Society in 1962. A governing system of Welsh devolution is employed in Wales, of which the most major step was the formation of the Senedd (Welsh Parliament, formerly the National Assembly for Wales) in 1998, responsible for a range of devolved policy matters.  At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, development of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial one; the South Wales Coalfield's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales's population. Two-thirds of the population live in South Wales, including Cardiff, Swansea, Newport and the nearby valleys. The eastern region of North Wales has about a sixth of the overall population, with Wrexham being the largest northern city. The remaining parts of Wales are sparsely populated. Now that the country's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline, the economy is based on the public sector, light and service industries, and tourism. Agriculture in Wales is largely livestock based, making Wales a net exporter of animal produce, contributing towards national agricultural self-sufficiency.  The country has a distinct national and cultural identity and from the late 19th century onwards Wales acquired its popular image as the \"land of song\", in part due to the eisteddfod tradition and rousing choir singing. Both Welsh and English are official languages. A majority of the population in most areas speaks English whilst the majority of the population in parts of the north and west speak Welsh, with a total of 538,300 Welsh speakers across the entire country.  The English words \"Wales\" and \"Welsh\" derive from the same Old English root (singular Wealh, plural W\u0113alas), a descendant of Proto-Germanic **Walhaz, which was itself derived from the name of the Gauls known to the Romans as Volcae. This term was later used to refer indiscriminately to inhabitants of the Western Roman Empire.[14] Anglo-Saxons came to use the term to refer to the Britons in particular; the plural form W\u0113alas evolved into the name for their territory, Wales.[15][16] Historically in Britain, the words were not restricted to modern Wales or to the Welsh but were used to refer to anything that Anglo-Saxons associated with Britons, including other non-Germanic territories in Britain (e.g. Cornwall) and places in Anglo-Saxon territory associated with Britons (e.g. Walworth in County Durham and Walton in West Yorkshire).[17]  The modern Welsh name for themselves is Cymry, and Cymru is the Welsh name for Wales. These words (both of which are pronounced [\u02c8k\u0259m.r\u0268]) are descended from the Brythonic word combrogi, meaning \"fellow-countrymen\",[18][19] and probably came into use before the 7th century.[20] In literature, they could be spelt Kymry or Cymry, regardless of whether it referred to the people or their homeland.[18] The Latinised forms of these names, Cambrian, Cambric and Cambria, survive as names such as the Cambrian Mountains and the Cambrian geological period.[21]  Wales has been inhabited by modern humans for at least 29,000 years.[22] Continuous human habitation dates from the end of the last ice age, between 12,000 and 10,000\u00a0years before present (BP), when Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from Central Europe began to migrate to Great Britain. At that time, sea levels were much lower than today. Wales was free of glaciers by about 10,250\u00a0BP, the warmer climate allowing the area to become heavily wooded. The post-glacial rise in sea level separated Wales and Ireland, forming the Irish Sea. By 8,000 BP the British Peninsula had become an island.[23] By the beginning of the Neolithic (c.\u20096,000 BP) sea levels in the Bristol Channel were still about 33 feet (10 metres) lower than today.[24] The historian John Davies theorised that the story of Cantre'r Gwaelod's drowning and tales in the Mabinogion, of the waters between Wales and Ireland being narrower and shallower, may be distant folk memories of this time.[25]  Neolithic colonists integrated with the indigenous people, gradually changing their lifestyles from a nomadic life of hunting and gathering, to become settled farmers about 6,000\u00a0BP \u2013 the Neolithic Revolution.[25][26] They cleared the forests to establish pasture and to cultivate the land, developed new technologies such as ceramics and textile production, and built cromlechs such as Pentre Ifan, Bryn Celli Ddu, and Parc Cwm long cairn between about 5,800\u00a0BP and 5,500\u00a0BP.[27] Over the following centuries they assimilated immigrants and adopted ideas from Bronze Age and Iron Age Celtic cultures. Some historians, such as John T. Koch, consider Wales in the Late Bronze Age as part of a maritime trading-networked culture that included other Celtic nations.[28] This \"Atlantic-Celtic\" view is opposed by others who hold that the Celtic languages derive their origins from the more easterly Hallstatt culture.[29] By the time of the Roman invasion of Britain the area of modern Wales had been divided among the tribes of the Deceangli (north-east), Ordovices (north-west), Demetae (south-west), Silures (south-east), and Cornovii (east).[25][30]  The Roman conquest of Wales began in AD 48 and took 30 years to complete; the occupation lasted over 300 years. The campaigns of conquest were opposed by two native tribes: the Silures and the Ordovices. Caractacus or Caradog, leader of the Ordovices, had initial success in resisting Roman invasions of north Wales but was eventually defeated.[31][32] Roman rule in Wales was a military occupation, save for the southern coastal region of south Wales, where there is a legacy of Romanisation.[33] The only town in Wales founded by the Romans, Caerwent, is in south east Wales.[34] Both Caerwent and Carmarthen, also in southern Wales, became Roman civitates.[35] Wales had a rich mineral wealth. The Romans used their engineering technology to extract large amounts of gold, copper and lead, as well as lesser amounts of zinc and silver.[36] No significant industries were located in Wales in this time;[36] this was largely a matter of circumstance as Wales had none of the necessary materials in suitable combination, and the forested, mountainous countryside was not amenable to industrialisation. Latin became the official language of Wales, though the people continued to speak in Brythonic. While Romanisation was far from complete, the upper classes came to consider themselves Roman, particularly after the ruling of 212 that granted Roman citizenship to all free men throughout the Empire.[37] Further Roman influence came through the spread of Christianity, which gained many followers when Christians were allowed to worship freely; state persecution ceased in the 4th\u00a0century, as a result of Constantine the Great issuing an edict of toleration in 313.[37]  Early historians, including the 6th-century cleric Gildas, have noted 383 as a significant point in Welsh history.[38] In that year, the Roman general Magnus Maximus, or Macsen Wledig, stripped Britain of troops to launch a successful bid for imperial power, continuing to rule Britain from Gaul as emperor, and transferring power to local leaders.[39] The earliest Welsh genealogies cite Maximus as the founder of several royal dynasties,[40] and as the father of the Welsh Nation.[38] He is given as the ancestor of a Welsh king on the Pillar of Eliseg, erected nearly 500 years after he left Britain, and he figures in lists of the Fifteen Tribes of Wales.[41]  The 400-year period following the collapse of Roman rule is the most difficult to interpret in the history of Wales.[37] After the Roman departure in AD 410, much of the lowlands of Britain to the east and south-east was overrun by various Germanic peoples, commonly known as Anglo-Saxons. Some have theorized that the cultural dominance of the Anglo-Saxons was due to apartheid-like social conditions in which the Britons were at a disadvantage.[42] By AD 500 the land that would become Wales had divided into a number of kingdoms free from Anglo-Saxon rule.[37] The kingdoms of Gwynedd, Powys, Dyfed, Caredigion, Morgannwg, the Ystrad Tywi, and Gwent emerged as independent Welsh successor states.[37] Archaeological evidence, in the Low Countries and what was to become England, shows early Anglo-Saxon migration to Great Britain reversed between 500 and 550, which concurs with Frankish chronicles.[43] John Davies notes this as consistent with a victory for the Celtic Britons at Badon Hill against the Saxons, which was attributed to Arthur by Nennius.[43]  Having lost much of what is now the West Midlands to Mercia in the 6th and early 7th centuries, a resurgent late-7th-century Powys checked Mercian advances. \u00c6thelbald of Mercia, looking to defend recently acquired lands, had built Wat's Dyke. According to Davies, this had been with the agreement of king Elisedd ap Gwylog of Powys, as this boundary, extending north from the valley of the River Severn to the Dee estuary, gave him Oswestry.[44] Another theory, after carbon dating placed the dyke's existence 300 years earlier, is that it was built by the post-Roman rulers of Wroxeter.[45] King Offa of Mercia seems to have continued this initiative when he created a larger earthwork, now known as Offa's Dyke (Clawdd Offa). Davies wrote of Cyril Fox's study of Offa's Dyke: \"In the planning of it, there was a degree of consultation with the kings of Powys and Gwent. On the Long Mountain near Trelystan, the dyke veers to the east, leaving the fertile slopes in the hands of the Welsh; near Rhiwabon, it was designed to ensure that Cadell ap Brochwel retained possession of the Fortress of Penygadden.\" And, for Gwent, Offa had the dyke built \"on the eastern crest of the gorge, clearly with the intention of recognizing that the River Wye and its traffic belonged to the kingdom of Gwent.\"[44] However, Fox's interpretations of both the length and purpose of the Dyke have been questioned by more recent research.[46]   In 853, the Vikings raided Anglesey, but in 856, Rhodri Mawr defeated and killed their leader, Gorm.[47] The Celtic Britons of Wales made peace with the Vikings and Anarawd ap Rhodri allied with the Norsemen occupying Northumbria to conquer the north.[48] This alliance later broke down and Anarawd came to an agreement with Alfred, king of Wessex, with whom he fought against the west Welsh. According to Annales Cambriae, in 894, \"Anarawd came with the Angles and laid waste to Ceredigion and Ystrad Tywi.\"[49] The southern and eastern parts of Great Britain lost to English settlement became known in Welsh as Lloegyr (Modern Welsh Lloegr), which may have referred to the kingdom of Mercia originally and which came to refer to England as a whole.[d] The Germanic tribes who now dominated these lands were invariably called Saeson, meaning \"Saxons\". The Anglo-Saxons called the Romano-British *Walha, meaning 'Romanised foreigner' or 'stranger'.[50] The Welsh continued to call themselves Brythoniaid (Brythons or Britons) well into the Middle Ages, though the first written evidence of the use of Cymru and y Cymry is found in a praise poem to Cadwallon ap Cadfan (Moliant Cadwallon, by Afan Ferddig) c.\u2009633.[15] In Armes Prydein, believed to be written around 930\u2013942, the words Cymry and Cymro are used as often as 15 times.[51] However, from the Anglo-Saxon settlement onwards, the people gradually begin to adopt the name Cymry over Brythoniad.[52]  From 800 onwards, a series of dynastic marriages led to Rhodri Mawr's (r. 844\u201377) inheritance of Gwynedd and Powys. His sons founded the three dynasties of (Aberffraw for Gwynedd, Dinefwr for Deheubarth and Mathrafal for Powys). Rhodri's grandson Hywel Dda (r. 900\u201350) founded Deheubarth out of his maternal and paternal inheritances of Dyfed and Seisyllwg in 930, ousted the Aberffraw dynasty from Gwynedd and Powys and then codified Welsh law in the 940s.[53]  Gruffydd ap Llywelyn was the only ruler to unite all of Wales under his rule, described by one chronicler after his death as king of Wales. In 1055 Gruffydd ap Llywelyn killed his rival Gruffydd ap Rhydderch in battle and recaptured Deheubarth.[54] Originally king of Gwynedd, by 1057 he was ruler of Wales and had annexed parts of England around the border. He ruled Wales with no internal battles.[55] His territories were again divided into the traditional kingdoms.[56] John Davies states that Gruffydd was \"the only Welsh king ever to rule over the entire territory of Wales... Thus, from about 1057 until his death in 1063, the whole of Wales recognised the kingship of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn. For about seven brief years, Wales was one, under one ruler, a feat with neither precedent nor successor.\"[2] Owain Gwynedd (1100\u20131170) of the Aberffraw line was the first Welsh ruler to use the title princeps Wallensium (prince of the Welsh), a title of substance given his victory on the Berwyn range, according to Davies.[57] During this time, between 1053 and 1063, Wales lacked any internal strife and was at peace.[58]  Within four years of the Battle of Hastings (1066), England had been completely subjugated by the Normans.[2] William I of England established a series of lordships, allocated to his most powerful warriors, along the Welsh border, their boundaries fixed only to the east (where they met other feudal properties inside England).[59] Starting in the 1070s, these lords began conquering land in southern and eastern Wales, west of the River Wye. The frontier region, and any English-held lordships in Wales, became known as Marchia Wallie, the Welsh Marches, in which the Marcher lords were subject to neither English nor Welsh law.[60] The extent of the March varied as the fortunes of the Marcher lords and the Welsh princes ebbed and flowed.[61]  Owain Gwynedd's grandson Llywelyn Fawr (the Great, 1173\u20131240), received the fealty of other Welsh lords in 1216 at the council at Aberdyfi, becoming in effect the first prince of Wales.[62] His grandson Llywelyn ap Gruffudd secured the recognition of the title Prince of Wales from Henry III with the Treaty of Montgomery in 1267.[63] Subsequent disputes, including the imprisonment of Llywelyn's wife Eleanor, culminated in the first invasion by King Edward I of England.[64] As a result of military defeat, the Treaty of Aberconwy exacted Llywelyn's fealty to England in 1277.[64] Peace was short-lived, and, with the 1282 Edwardian conquest, the rule of the Welsh princes permanently ended. With Llywelyn's death and his brother prince Dafydd's execution, the few remaining Welsh lords did homage to Edward I of England.[65] The Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284 provided the constitutional basis for a post-conquest government of the Principality of North Wales from 1284 until 1535\/36.[66] It defined Wales as \"annexed and united\" to the English Crown, separate from England but under the same monarch. The king ruled directly in two areas: the Statute divided the north and delegated administrative duties to the Justice of Chester and Justiciar of North Wales, and further south in western Wales the King's authority was delegated to the Justiciar of South Wales. The existing royal lordships of Montgomery and Builth Wells remained unchanged.[67] To maintain his dominance, Edward constructed a series of castles: Beaumaris, Caernarfon, Harlech and Conwy. His son, the future Edward II, was born at Caernarfon in 1284.[68] He became the first English prince of Wales in 1301, which at the time provided an income from northwest Wales known as the Principality of Wales.[69]  After the failed revolt in 1294\u20131295 of Madog ap Llywelyn \u2013 who styled himself Prince of Wales in the Penmachno Document \u2013 and the rising of Llywelyn Bren (1316), the last uprising was led by Owain Glynd\u0175r, against Henry IV of England. In 1404, Owain was crowned prince of Wales in the presence of emissaries from France, Spain (Castille) and Scotland.[70] Glynd\u0175r went on to hold parliamentary assemblies at several Welsh towns, including a Welsh parliament (Welsh: senedd) at Machynlleth. The rebellion was eventually defeated by 1412. Having failed Owain went into hiding and nothing was known of him after 1413.[71][72] The penal laws against the Welsh of 1401\u201302 passed by the English parliament made the Welsh second-class citizens. With hopes of independence ended, there were no further wars or rebellions against English colonial rule and the laws remained on the statute books until 1624.[73]  Henry Tudor (born in Wales in 1457) seized the throne of England from Richard III of England in 1485, uniting England and Wales under one royal house. The last remnants of Celtic-tradition Welsh law were abolished and replaced by English law by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 during the reign of Henry VII's son, Henry VIII.[74] In the legal jurisdiction of England and Wales, Wales became unified with the kingdom of England; the \"Principality of Wales\" began to refer to the whole country, though it remained a \"principality\" only in a ceremonial sense.[66][75] The Marcher lordships were abolished, and Wales began electing members of the Westminster parliament.[76]  In 1536 Wales had around 278,000 inhabitants, which increased to around 360,000 by 1620. This was primarily due to rural settlement, where animal farming was central to the Welsh economy. Increase in trade and increased economic stability occurred due to the increased diversity of the Welsh economy. Population growth however outpaced economic growth and the standard of living dropped.[77]  Prior to the Industrial Revolution in Wales, there were small-scale industries scattered throughout Wales.[78] These ranged from those connected to agriculture, such as milling and the manufacture of woollen textiles, through to mining and quarrying.[78] Agriculture remained the dominant source of wealth.[78] The emerging industrial period saw the development of copper smelting in the Swansea area. With access to local coal deposits and a harbour that connected it with Cornwall's copper mines in the south and the large copper deposits at Parys Mountain on Anglesey, Swansea developed into the world's major centre for non-ferrous metal smelting in the 19th century.[78] The second metal industry to expand in Wales was iron smelting, and iron manufacturing became prevalent in both the north and the south of the country.[79] In the north, John Wilkinson's Ironworks at Bersham was a major centre, while in the south, at Merthyr Tydfil, the ironworks of Dowlais, Cyfarthfa, Plymouth and Penydarren became the most significant hub of iron manufacture in Wales.[79] By the 1820s, south Wales produced 40 per cent of all Britain's pig iron.[79]  By the 18th century, lawyers, doctors, estate agents and government officials formed a bourgeoisie with sizeable houses.[77] In the late 18th century, slate quarrying began to expand rapidly, most notably in North Wales. The Penrhyn quarry, opened in 1770 by Richard Pennant, 1st Baron Penrhyn, was employing 15,000 men by the late 19th century,[80] and along with Dinorwic quarry, it dominated the Welsh slate trade. Although slate quarrying has been described as \"the most Welsh of Welsh industries\",[81] it is coal mining which became the industry synonymous with Wales and its people. Initially, coal seams were exploited to provide energy for local metal industries but, with the opening of canal systems and later the railways, Welsh coal mining saw an explosion in demand. As the South Wales Coalfield was exploited, Cardiff, Swansea, Penarth and Barry grew as world exporters of coal. By its height in 1913, Wales was producing almost 61 million tons of coal.[82]  Historian Kenneth Morgan described Wales on the eve of the First World War as a \"relatively placid, self-confident and successful nation\". The output from the coalfields continued to increase, with the Rhondda Valley recording a peak of 9.6\u00a0million tons of coal extracted in 1913.[83] The First World War (1914\u20131918) saw a total of 272,924 Welshmen under arms, representing 21.5 per cent of the male population. Of these, roughly 35,000 were killed,[84] with particularly heavy losses of Welsh forces at Mametz Wood on the Somme and the Battle of Passchendaele.[85] The first quarter of the 20th century also saw a shift in the political landscape of Wales. Since 1865, the Liberal Party had held a parliamentary majority in Wales and, following the general election of 1906, only one non-Liberal Member of Parliament, Keir Hardie of Merthyr Tydfil, represented a Welsh constituency at Westminster. Yet by 1906, industrial dissension and political militancy had begun to undermine Liberal consensus in the southern coalfields.[86] In 1916, David Lloyd George became the first Welshman to become Prime Minister of Britain.[87] In December 1918, Lloyd George was re-elected at the head of a Conservative-dominated coalition government, and his poor handling of the 1919 coal miners' strike was a key factor in destroying support for the Liberal party in south Wales.[88] The industrial workers of Wales began shifting towards the Labour Party. When in 1908 the Miners' Federation of Great Britain became affiliated to the Labour Party, the four Labour candidates sponsored by miners were all elected as MPs. By 1922, half the Welsh seats at Westminster were held by Labour politicians\u2014the start of a Labour dominance of Welsh politics that continued into the 21st century.[89]  After economic growth in the first two decades of the 20th century, Wales's staple industries endured a prolonged slump from the early 1920s to the late 1930s, leading to widespread unemployment and poverty.[90] For the first time in centuries, the population of Wales went into decline; unemployment reduced only with the production demands of the Second World War.[91] The war saw Welsh servicemen and women fight in all major theatres, with some 15,000 of them killed. Bombing raids brought high loss of life as the German Air Force targeted the docks at Swansea, Cardiff and Pembroke. After 1943, 10 per cent of Welsh conscripts aged 18 were sent to work in the coal mines, where there were labour shortages; they became known as Bevin Boys. Pacifist numbers during both World Wars were fairly low, especially in the Second World War, which was seen as a fight against fascism.[92]  Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925, seeking greater autonomy or independence from the rest of the UK.[93] The term \"England and Wales\" became common for describing the area to which English law applied, and in 1955 Cardiff was proclaimed as Wales's capital. Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg (The Welsh Language Society) was formed in 1962, in response to fears that the language might soon die out.[94] Nationalist sentiment grew following the flooding of the Tryweryn valley in 1965 to create a reservoir to supply water to the English city of Liverpool.[95] Although 35 of the 36 Welsh MPs voted against the bill (one abstained), Parliament passed the bill and the village of Capel Celyn was submerged, highlighting Wales's powerlessness in her own affairs in the face of the numerical superiority of English MPs in Parliament.[96] Separatist groupings, such as the Free Wales Army and Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru were formed, conducting campaigns from 1963.[97] Prior to the investiture of Charles in 1969, these groups were responsible for a number of bomb attacks on infrastructure.[98] At a by-election in 1966, Gwynfor Evans won the parliamentary seat of Carmarthen, Plaid Cymru's first Parliamentary seat.[99]  By the end of the 1960s, the policy of bringing businesses into disadvantaged areas of Wales through financial incentives had proven very successful in diversifying the industrial economy.[100] This policy, begun in 1934, was enhanced by the construction of industrial estates and improvements in transport communications,[100] most notably the M4 motorway linking south Wales directly to London. It was believed that the foundations for stable economic growth had been firmly established in Wales during this period, but this was shown to be optimistic after the recession of the early 1980s saw the collapse of much of the manufacturing base that had been built over the preceding forty years.[101]  The Welsh Language Act 1967 repealed a section of the Wales and Berwick Act and thus \"Wales\" was no longer part of the legal definition of England. This essentially defined Wales as a separate entity legally (but within the UK), for the first time since before the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 which defined Wales as a part of the Kingdom of England. The Welsh Language Act 1967 also expanded areas where use of Welsh was permitted, including in some legal situations.[102]  In a referendum in 1979, Wales voted against the creation of a Welsh assembly with an 80 per cent majority. In 1997, a second referendum on the same issue secured a very narrow majority (50.3 per cent).[103] The National Assembly for Wales (Cynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru) was set up in 1999 (under the Government of Wales Act 1998) with the power to determine how Wales's central government budget is spent and administered, although the UK Parliament reserved the right to set limits on its powers.[103] The governments of the United Kingdom and of Wales almost invariably define Wales as a country.[104] The Welsh Government says: \"Wales is not a Principality. Although we are joined with England by land, and we are part of Great Britain, Wales is a country in its own right.\"[105][e]  The Government of Wales Act 2006 (c 32) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that reformed the National Assembly for Wales and allows further powers to be granted to it more easily. The Act creates a system of government with a separate executive drawn from and accountable to the legislature.[107] Following a successful referendum in 2011 on extending the law making powers of the National Assembly it is now able to make laws, known as Acts of the Assembly, on all matters in devolved subject areas, without needing the UK Parliament's agreement.[107]  In the 2016 referendum, Wales voted in support of leaving the European Union, although demographic differences became evident. According to Danny Dorling, professor of geography at Oxford University, votes for Leave may have been boosted by the large proportion (21 per cent) of retired English people living in Wales.[108]   After the Senedd and Elections (Wales) Act 2020, the National Assembly was renamed \"Senedd Cymru\" (in Welsh) and the \"Welsh Parliament\" (in English), which was seen as a better reflection of the body's expanded legislative powers.[109] In 2016, YesCymru was launched. A non party-political campaign for an independent Wales which held its first rally in Cardiff in 2019.[110] An opinion poll in March 2021 showed a record 39 per cent support for Welsh independence when excluding don't knows.[111]  The Welsh language (Welsh: Cymraeg) is an Indo-European language of the Celtic family;[112] the most closely related languages are Cornish and Breton. Most linguists believe that the Celtic languages arrived in Britain around 600 BCE.[113] The Brythonic languages ceased to be spoken in England and were replaced by the English language, a Germanic language which arrived in Wales around the end of the eighth century due to the defeat of the Kingdom of Powys.[114]  The Bible translations into Welsh and the Protestant Reformation, which encouraged use of the vernacular in religious services, helped the language survive after Welsh elites abandoned it in favour of English in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.[115]  Successive Welsh Language Acts, in 1942, 1967 and 1993, improved the legal status of Welsh.[116] The Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011 modernised the 1993 Welsh Language Act and gave Welsh an official status in Wales for the first time, a major landmark for the language. The Measure also created the post of Welsh Language Commissioner, replacing the Welsh Language Board.[117] Following the referendum in 2011, the Official Languages Act became the first Welsh law to be created in 600 years, according to the First Minister at the time, Carwyn Jones. This law was passed by Welsh Assembly members (AMs) only and made Welsh an official language of the National Assembly.[118]  Starting in the 1960s, many road signs have been replaced by bilingual versions.[119] Various public and private sector bodies have adopted bilingualism to a varying degree and (since 2011) Welsh is the only official (de jure) language in any part of Great Britain.[120]  Wales is a country that is part of the sovereign state of the United Kingdom.[13] Constitutionally, the UK is a de jure unitary state, with a parliament and government in Westminster.[121] Wales has a devolved, unicameral legislature known as the Senedd (Senedd Cymru - Welsh Parliament) which holds devolved powers from the UK Parliament via a reserved powers model.[122] For the purposes of local government, Wales has been divided into 22 council areas since 1996. These \"principal areas\"[123] are responsible for the provision of all local government services.[124]  In the House of Commons \u2013 the 650-member lower house of the UK Parliament \u2013 there are 40 members of Parliament (MPs) who represent Welsh constituencies. At the 2019 general election, 22 Labour and Labour Co-op MPs were elected, along with 14 Conservative MPs and 4 Plaid Cymru MPs from Wales.[121] The Wales Office is a department of the UK government responsible for Wales, whose minister, the secretary of state for Wales (Welsh secretary), sits in the UK cabinet.[125]  Following devolution in 1997, the Government of Wales Act 1998 created a Welsh devolved assembly, the National Assembly for Wales, with the power to determine how Wales's central government budget is spent and administered.[126] Eight years later, the Government of Wales Act 2006 reformed the National Assembly for Wales and allowed further powers to be granted to it more easily. The Act also created a system of government with a separate executive, the Welsh Government, drawn from and accountable to the legislature, the National Assembly. Following a successful referendum in 2011, the National Assembly was empowered to make laws, known as Acts of the Assembly, on all matters in devolved subject areas, without requiring the UK Parliament's approval of legislative competence. It also gained powers to raise taxes.[127]:\u200a33\u201334\u200a In May 2020, the National Assembly was renamed \"Senedd Cymru\" or \"the Welsh Parliament\", commonly known as the Senedd in both English and Welsh.[127]:\u200a18,\u200a33\u201334\u200a  Devolved areas of responsibility include agriculture, economic development, education, health, housing, local government, social services, tourism, transport and the Welsh language.[128] The Welsh Government also promotes Welsh interests abroad.[129]  By tradition, Welsh Law was compiled during an assembly held at Whitland around 930 by Hywel Dda, king of most of Wales between 942 and his death in 950. The 'law of Hywel Dda' (Welsh: Cyfraith Hywel), as it became known, codified the previously existing folk laws and legal customs that had evolved in Wales over centuries. Welsh Law emphasised the payment of compensation for a crime to the victim, or the victim's kin, rather than punishment by the ruler.[130] Other than in the Marches, where March law was imposed by the Marcher Lords, Welsh Law remained in force in Wales until the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284. Edward I of England annexed the Principality of Wales following the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, and Welsh Law was replaced for criminal cases under the Statute. Marcher Law and Welsh Law (for civil cases) remained in force until Henry VIII of England annexed the whole of Wales under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 (often referred to as the Acts of Union of 1536 and 1543), after which English law applied to the whole of Wales.[131][132] The Wales and Berwick Act 1746 provided that all laws that applied to England would automatically apply to Wales (and the Anglo-Scottish border town of Berwick) unless the law explicitly stated otherwise; this Act was repealed with regard to Wales in 1967. English law has been the legal system of England and Wales since 1536.[133]  English law is regarded as a common law system, with no major codification of the law and legal precedents are binding as opposed to persuasive. The court system is headed by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom which is the highest court of appeal in the land for criminal and civil cases. The Senior Courts of England and Wales is the highest court of first instance as well as an appellate court. The three divisions are the Court of Appeal, the High Court of Justice, and the Crown Court. Minor cases are heard by magistrates' courts or the County Court. In 2007 the Wales and Cheshire Region (known as the Wales and Cheshire Circuit before 2005) came to an end when Cheshire was attached to the North-Western England Region. From that point, Wales became a legal unit in its own right, although it remains part of the single jurisdiction of England and Wales.[134]  The Senedd has the authority to draft and approve laws outside of the UK Parliamentary system to meet the specific needs of Wales. Under powers approved by a referendum held in March 2011, it is empowered to pass primary legislation, at the time referred to as an Act of the National Assembly for Wales but now known as an Act of Senedd Cymru in relation to twenty subjects listed in the Government of Wales Act 2006 such as health and education. Through this primary legislation, the Welsh Government can then also enact more specific subordinate legislation.[135]  Wales is served by four regional police forces: Dyfed-Powys Police, Gwent Police, North Wales Police, and South Wales Police.[136] There are five prisons in Wales: four in the southern half of the country, and one in Wrexham. Wales has no women's prisons: female inmates are imprisoned in England.[137]  Wales is a generally mountainous country on the western side of central southern Great Britain.[138] It is about 170 miles (270\u00a0km) north to south.[139] The oft-quoted \"size of Wales\" is about 20,779\u00a0km2 (8,023\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[140] Wales is bordered by England to the east and by sea in all other directions: the Irish Sea to the north and west, St George's Channel and the Celtic Sea to the southwest and the Bristol Channel to the south.[141][142] Wales has about 1,680 miles (2,700\u00a0km) of coastline (along the mean high water mark), including the mainland, Anglesey and Holyhead.[143] Over 50 islands lie off the Welsh mainland, the largest being Anglesey, in the north-west.[144]  Much of Wales's diverse landscape is mountainous, particularly in the north and central regions. The mountains were shaped during the last ice age, the Devensian glaciation. The highest mountains in Wales are in Snowdonia (Eryri), of which five are over 1,000\u00a0m (3,300\u00a0ft). The highest of these is Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa), at 1,085\u00a0m (3,560\u00a0ft).[145][146] The 14 Welsh mountains, or 15 if including Carnedd Gwenllian\u00a0\u2013 often discounted because of its low topographic prominence\u00a0\u2013 over 3,000 feet (910 metres) high are known collectively as the Welsh 3000s and are located in a small area in the north-west.[147] The highest outside the 3000s is Aran Fawddwy, at 905 metres (2,969 feet), in the south of Snowdonia.[148] The Brecon Beacons (Bannau Brycheiniog) are in the south (highest point Pen y Fan, at 886 metres (2,907 feet)),[149] and are joined by the Cambrian Mountains in Mid Wales (highest point Pumlumon, at 752 metres (2,467 feet)).[150]  Wales has three national parks: Snowdonia, Brecon Beacons, and Pembrokeshire Coast (Arfordir Penfro). It has five Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty: Anglesey, the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley, the Gower Peninsula, the Ll\u0177n Peninsula, and the Wye Valley.[151] The Gower Peninsula was the first area in the United Kingdom to be designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, in 1956. As of 2019, the coastline of Wales had 40 Blue Flag beaches, three Blue Flag marinas and one Blue Flag boat operator.[152] Despite its heritage and award-winning beaches, the south and west coasts of Wales, along with the Irish and Cornish coasts, are frequently blasted by Atlantic westerlies\/south-westerlies that, over the years, have sunk and wrecked many vessels. In 1859 over 110 ships were destroyed off the coast of Wales in a hurricane that saw more than 800 lives lost across Britain.[153] The greatest single loss occurred with the sinking of the Royal Charter off Anglesey in which 459 people died.[154] The 19th century saw over 100 vessels lost with an average loss of 78 sailors per year.[155] Wartime action caused losses near Holyhead, Milford Haven and Swansea.[155] Because of offshore rocks and unlit islands, Anglesey and Pembrokeshire are still notorious for shipwrecks, most notably the Sea Empress oil spill in 1996.[156]  The first border between Wales and England was zonal, apart from around the River Wye, which was the first accepted boundary.[157] Offa's Dyke was supposed to form an early distinct line but this was thwarted by Gruffudd ap Llewellyn, who reclaimed swathes of land beyond the dyke.[157] The Act of Union of 1536 formed a linear border stretching from the mouth of the Dee to the mouth of the Wye.[157] Even after the Act of Union, many of the borders remained vague and moveable until the Welsh Sunday Closing act of 1881, which forced local businesses to decide which country they fell within to accept either the Welsh or English law.[157]  The earliest geological period of the Palaeozoic era, the Cambrian, takes its name from the Cambrian Mountains, where geologists first identified Cambrian remnants.[158][159] In the mid-19th century, Roderick Murchison and Adam Sedgwick used their studies of Welsh geology to establish certain principles of stratigraphy and palaeontology. The next two periods of the Palaeozoic era, the Ordovician and Silurian, were named after ancient Celtic tribes from this area.[160][161]  Wales lies within the north temperate zone. It has a changeable, maritime climate and is one of the wettest countries in Europe.[163][164] Welsh weather is often cloudy, wet and windy, with warm summers and mild winters.[163][165]  Wales's wildlife is typical of Britain with several distinctions. Because of its long coastline, Wales hosts a variety of seabirds. The coasts and surrounding islands are home to colonies of gannets, Manx shearwater, puffins, kittiwakes, shags and razorbills. In comparison, with 60 per cent of Wales above the 150m contour, the country also supports a variety of upland-habitat birds, including raven and ring ouzel.[171][172] Birds of prey include the merlin, hen harrier and the red kite, a national symbol of Welsh wildlife.[173] In total, more than 200 different species of bird have been seen at the RSPB reserve at Conwy, including seasonal visitors.[174] Larger mammals, including brown bears, wolves and wildcats, died out during the Norman period. Today, mammals include shrews, voles, badgers, otters, stoats, weasels, hedgehogs and fifteen species of bat. Two species of small rodent, the yellow-necked mouse and the dormouse, are of special Welsh note being found at the historically undisturbed border area.[175] The pine marten, which has been sighted occasionally, has been reintroduced in parts of Wales since 2015, having previously not been officially recorded since the 1950s.[176] The polecat was nearly driven to extinction in Britain, but hung on in Wales and is now rapidly spreading. Feral goats can be found in Snowdonia.[177] In March 2021, Natural Resources Wales (NRW) granted a licence to release up to six beavers in the Dyfi Valley, the first official beaver release in Wales.[178]  Believed to be home to some of Wales's rarest land invertebrates, some 2,500 disused coal tips are the subject of study by the Welsh Government; the tips are home to a wide variety of other wildlife.[179]  The waters of south-west Wales of Gower, Pembrokeshire and Cardigan Bay attract marine animals, including basking sharks, Atlantic grey seals, leatherback turtles, dolphins, porpoises, jellyfish, crabs and lobsters. Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion, in particular, are recognised as an area of international importance for bottlenose dolphins, and New Quay has the only summer residence of bottlenose dolphins in the whole of the UK. River fish of note include char, eel, salmon, shad, sparling and Arctic char, whilst the gwyniad is unique to Wales, found only in Bala Lake. Wales is known for its shellfish, including cockles, limpet, mussels and periwinkles. Herring, mackerel and hake are the more common of the country's marine fish.[180] The north facing high grounds of Snowdonia support a relict pre-glacial flora including the iconic Snowdon lily \u2013 Gagea serotina \u2013 and other alpine species such as Saxifraga cespitosa, Saxifraga oppositifolia and Silene acaulis. Wales has a number of plant species not found elsewhere in the UK, including the spotted rock-rose Tuberaria guttata on Anglesey and Draba aizoides on the Gower.[181]  Over the last 250 years, Wales has been transformed from a predominantly agricultural country to an industrial, and then to a post-industrial economy.[182] In the 1950s, Wales's GDP was twice as big as Ireland\u2019s; by the 2020s, Ireland's economy was four times that of Wales. Since the Second World War, the service sector has come to account for the majority of jobs, a feature typifying most advanced economies.[183] in 2018, according to OECD and Eurostat data, gross domestic product (GDP) in Wales was \u00a375\u00a0billion, an increase of 3.3 per cent from 2017. GDP per head in Wales in 2018 was \u00a323,866, an increase of 2.9 per cent on 2017. This compares to Italy\u2019s GDP\/capita of \u00a325,000, Spain \u00a322,000, Slovenia \u00a320,000 and New Zealand \u00a330,000.[184][185] In the three months to December 2017, 72.7 per cent of working-age adults were employed, compared to 75.2 per cent across the UK as a whole.[186] For the 2018\u201319 fiscal year, the Welsh fiscal deficit accounts for 19.4 per cent of Wales's estimated GDP.[187]  In 2019, Wales was a net exporter of electricity. It produced 27.9 TWh of electricity while only consuming 14.7 TWh.[188] In 2021, the Welsh government said that more than half the country's energy needs were being met by renewable sources, 2 per cent of which was from 363 hydropower projects.[189]  By UK law, Wales contributes to items that do not directly benefit Wales e.g. over \u00a35 billion for HS2 \"which will damage the Welsh economy by \u00a3200m pa\", according to the UK and Welsh Government's transport adviser Mark Barry. Wales also pays more in military costs than most similar-sized countries e.g. Wales pays twice the amount Ireland spends on the military.[190] The UK government spends \u00a31.75bn per year on the military in Wales, which is almost as much as Wales spends on education every year (\u00a31.8 billion in 2018\/19) and five times as much as the total amount spent on the police in Wales (\u00a3365 million).[191]  From the middle of the 19th century until the post-war era, the mining and export of coal was the dominant industry. At its peak of production in 1913, nearly 233,000 men and women were employed in the South Wales coalfield, mining 56 million tons of coal.[192] Cardiff was once the largest coal-exporting port in the world and, for a few years before the First World War, handled a greater tonnage of cargo than either London or Liverpool.[193] In the 1920s, over 40 per cent of the male Welsh population worked in heavy industry.[194] According to Phil Williams, the Great Depression \"devastated Wales\", north and south, because of its \"overwhelming dependence on coal and steel\".[194] From the mid-1970s, the Welsh economy faced massive restructuring with large numbers of jobs in heavy industry disappearing and being replaced eventually by new ones in light industry and in services. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Wales was successful in attracting an above average share of foreign direct investment in the UK.[195] Much of the new industry was essentially of a \"branch (or \"screwdriver\") factory\" type where a manufacturing plant or call centre is in Wales but the most highly-paid jobs in the company are elsewhere.[196][197]  Poor-quality soil in much of Wales is unsuitable for crop-growing, so livestock farming has been the focus of farming. About 78 per cent of the land surface is used for agriculture.[198] The Welsh landscape, with its three national parks and Blue Flag beaches, attracts large numbers of tourists, who bolster the economy of rural areas.[199] Wales, like Northern Ireland, has relatively few high value-added employment in sectors such as finance and research and development, attributable in part to a comparative lack of \"economic mass\" (i.e. population) \u2013 Wales lacks a large metropolitan centre.[197] The lack of high value-added employment is reflected in lower economic output per head relative to other regions of the UK: in 2002 it stood at 90 per cent of the EU25 average and around 80 per cent of the UK average.[197] In June 2008, Wales made history by becoming the first nation to be awarded Fairtrade status.[200]  The pound sterling is the currency used in Wales. Numerous Welsh banks issued their own banknotes in the 19th century: the last bank to do so closed in 1908. Since then the Bank of England has had a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in Wales.[201] The Commercial Bank of Wales, established in Cardiff by Sir Julian Hodge in 1971, was taken over by the Bank of Scotland in 1988 and absorbed into its parent company in 2002.[202] The Royal Mint, which issues the coinage circulating through the whole of the UK, has been based at a single site in Llantrisant since 1980.[203] Since decimalisation, in 1971, at least one of the coins in circulation emphasises Wales such as the 1995 and 2000 one pound coin (above). As at 2012, the last designs devoted to Wales saw production in 2008.[204]  During 2020, and well into 2021, the restrictions and lockdowns necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic affected all sectors of the economy and \"tourism and hospitality suffered notable losses from the pandemic\" across the UK.[205] As of 6 April 2021, visitors from \"red list\" countries were still not allowed to enter unless they were UK residents. Restrictions will \"likely be in place until the summer\", one report predicted, with June being the most likely time for tourism from other countries to begin a rebound.[206] On 12 April 2021, many tourist facilities were still closed in Wales but non-essential travel between Wales and England was finally permitted. Wales also allowed non-essential retail stores to open.[207]\u00a0  The M4 motorway running from West London to South Wales links Newport, Cardiff and Swansea. Responsibility for the section of the motorway within Wales, from the Second Severn Crossing to Pont Abraham services, sits with the Welsh Government.  [208] The A55 expressway has a similar role along the North Wales coast, connecting Holyhead and Bangor with Wrexham and Flintshire. It also links to northwest England, principally Chester.[209] The main north-south Wales link is the A470, which runs from Cardiff to Llandudno.[210] Rail transport in Wales includes the Wales & Borders franchise, which is overseen by the Welsh Government with most passenger services operated by Transport for Wales Rail.[211] The Cardiff region has its own urban rail network. Beeching cuts in the 1960s mean that most of the remaining network is geared toward east-west travel connecting with the Irish Sea ports for ferries to Ireland.[212] Services between north and south Wales operate through the English cities of Chester and Hereford and towns of Shrewsbury, Gobowen for Oswestry and along the Welsh Marches Line, with trains on the Heart of Wales Line from Swansea to Llandovery, Llandrindod and Knighton connecting the Welsh March Line in Craven Arms. Trains in Wales are mainly diesel-powered but the South Wales Main Line branch of the Great Western Main Line used by services from London Paddington to Cardiff is undergoing electrification, although the programme has experienced significant delays and costs-overruns.[213] A North-South railway has been suggested to better link North and South Wales.[214][215][216]  Cardiff Airport is the international airport of Wales. Providing links to European, African and North American destinations, it is about 12 miles (19\u00a0km) southwest of Cardiff city centre, in the Vale of Glamorgan. Intra-Wales flights used to run between Anglesey (Valley) and Cardiff, and were operated since 2017 by Eastern Airways.,[217] those flights are no longer, as of 2022, available. Other internal flights operate to northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.[218] Wales has four commercial ferry ports. Regular ferry services to Ireland operate from Holyhead, Pembroke Dock and Fishguard. The Swansea to Cork service was cancelled in 2006, reinstated in March 2010, and withdrawn again in 2012.[219]   A distinct education system has developed in Wales.[221] Formal education before the 18th century was the preserve of the elite. The first grammar schools were established in Welsh towns such as Ruthin, Brecon and Cowbridge.[221] One of the first successful schooling systems was started by Griffith Jones, who introduced the circulating schools in the 1730s; these are believed to have taught half the country's population to read.[222] In the 19th century, with increasing state involvement in education, Wales was forced to adopt an education system that was English in ethos even though the country was predominantly Non-conformist, Welsh-speaking and demographically uneven because of the economic expansion in the south.[222] In some schools, to ensure Welsh children spoke English at school, the Welsh Not was employed as corrective punishment; this was much resented,[223] although the extent of its use is difficult to determine.[224] State and local governmental edicts resulted in schooling in the English language which, following the 1847 Inquiry into the State of Education in Wales \u2013 an event subsequently referred to as the Treachery of the Blue Books (Welsh: Brad y Llyfrau Gleision) \u2013 was seen as more academic and worthwhile for children.[225]  The University College of Wales opened in Aberystwyth in 1872. Cardiff and Bangor followed, and the three colleges came together in 1893 to form the University of Wales.[222] The Welsh Intermediate Education Act of 1889 created 95 secondary schools. The Welsh Department for the Board of Education followed in 1907, which gave Wales its first significant educational devolution.[222] A resurgence in Welsh-language schools in the latter half of the 20th century at nursery and primary level saw attitudes shift towards teaching in the medium of Welsh.[226] Welsh is a compulsory subject in all of Wales's state schools for pupils aged 5\u201316 years old.[227] While there has never been an exclusively Welsh-language college, Welsh-medium higher education is delivered through the individual universities and has since 2011 been supported by the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol (Welsh National College) as a delocalised federal institution. In 2021\u20132022, there were 1,470 maintained schools in Wales.[228] In 2021\u201322, the country had 471,131 pupils taught by 25,210 full-time equivalent teachers.[229][230]  Public healthcare in Wales is provided by NHS Wales (GIG Cymru), through seven local health boards and three all-Wales trusts. It was originally formed as part of the NHS structure for England and Wales by the National Health Service Act 1946, but with powers over the NHS in Wales coming under the Secretary of State for Wales in 1969.[231] Responsibility for NHS Wales passed to the Welsh Assembly under devolution in 1999, and is now the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Social Services.[232] Historically, Wales was served by smaller 'cottage' hospitals, built as voluntary institutions.[233] As newer, more expensive, diagnostic techniques and treatments became available, clinical work has been concentrated in newer, larger district hospitals.[233] In 2006, there were seventeen district hospitals in Wales.[233] NHS Wales directly employs over 90,000 staff, making it Wales's biggest employer.[234] The National Survey for Wales in 2021\u201322 reported that 72 per cent of adults surveyed had good or very good general health, 19 per cent had fair general health and 8 had bad or very bad general health.[235] The survey recorded that 46 per cent of Welsh adults had a long-standing illness, such as arthritis, asthma, diabetes or heart disease.[236] The survey also reported that 13 per cent of the adult population were smokers, 16 per cent admitted drinking alcohol above weekly recommended guidelines, while 56 per cent undertook the recommended 150 minutes of physical activity each week.[237] According to the survey, 30 per cent of adults in Wales reported to have eaten at least 5 portions of fruit or vegetables the previous day and 36 per cent reported a healthy weight.[238]  The population of Wales doubled from 587,000 in 1801 to 1,163,000 in 1851 and had reached 2,421,000 by 1911. Most of the increase came in the coal mining districts, especially Glamorganshire, which grew from 71,000 in 1801 to 232,000 in 1851 and 1,122,000 in 1911.[242] Part of this increase can be attributed to the demographic transition seen in most industrialising countries during the Industrial Revolution, as death rates dropped and birth rates remained steady. However, there was also large-scale migration into Wales during the Industrial Revolution. The English were the most numerous group, but there were also considerable numbers of Irish and smaller numbers of other ethnic groups,[243] including Italians, who migrated to South Wales.[244] Wales also received immigration from various parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations in the 20th century, and African-Caribbean and Asian communities add to the ethnocultural mix, particularly in urban Wales. Many of these self-identify as Welsh.[245]  The population in 1972 stood at 2.74 million and remained broadly static for the rest of the decade. However, in the early 1980s, the population fell due to net migration out of Wales. Since the 1980s, net migration has generally been inward, and has contributed more to population growth than natural change.[246] The resident population of Wales in 2021 according to the census was 3,107,500 (1,586,600 female and 1,521,000 male), an increase of 1.4 per cent over 2011. A decreased change from the 5 per cent increase between 2001 and 2011.[247] Wales accounted for 5.2 per cent of the population of England and Wales in 2021. Wales has seven cities, those being Cardiff, Newport, Swansea, and Wrexham, with the communities of Bangor, St Asaph and St Davids also having city status in the United Kingdom.[248] Wrexham, north Wales's largest settlement, became Wales's newest and seventh city in September 2022.[249]  Welsh is an official language in Wales as legislated by the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011.[251] Both Welsh and English are also official languages of the Senedd.[252] The proportion of the Welsh population able to speak the Welsh language fell from just under 50 per cent in 1901 to 43.5 per cent in 1911, and continued to fall to a low of 18.9 per cent in 1981.[253] The results of the 2001 Census showed an increase in the number of Welsh speakers to 21 per cent of the population aged 3 and older, compared with 18.7 per cent in 1991 and 19 per cent in 1981. This compares with a pattern of steady decline indicated by census results during the 20th century.[254] In the 2011 census it was recorded that the proportion of people able to speak Welsh had dropped from 20.8 per cent to 19 per cent (still higher than 1991). Despite an increase in the overall size of the Welsh population this still meant that the number of Welsh speakers in Wales dropped from 582,000 in 2001 to 562,000 in 2011. However this figure was still much higher than 508,000 or 18.7 per cent of people who said they could speak Welsh in the 1991 census.[255]  According to the 2021 census, the Welsh-speaking population of Wales aged three or older was 17.8 per cent (538,300 people) and nearly three quarters of the population in Wales said they had no Welsh language skills.[256] Other estimates suggest that 29.7 per cent (899,500) of people aged three or older in Wales could speak Welsh in June 2022.[257]  English is spoken by almost all people in Wales and is the main language in most of the country. Code-switching is common in all parts of Wales and is known by various terms, though none is recognised by professional linguists.[258] \"Wenglish\" is the Welsh English language dialect. It has been influenced significantly by Welsh grammar and includes words derived from Welsh.[259] Northern and western Wales retain many areas where Welsh is spoken as a first language by the majority of the population, and English learnt as a second language. Although monoglotism in young children continues, life-long monoglotism in Welsh no longer occurs.[260]  Since Poland joined the European Union, Wales has seen a significant increase in Polish immigrants. This has made Polish the most common main language in Wales after English or Welsh, at 0.7 per cent of the population.[261]  Forms of Christianity have dominated religious life in what is now the Wales for more than 1,400 years.[262][263] The 2021 census recorded 46.5 per cent had \"No religion\", more than any single religious affiliation and up from 32.1 per cent in 2011.[264] The largest religion in Wales is Christianity, with 43.6 per cent of the population describing themselves as Christian in the 2021 census.[264] The patron saint of Wales is Saint David (Dewi Sant), with Saint David's Day (Dydd G\u0175yl Dewi Sant) celebrated annually on 1 March.[265] The early 20th century saw a religious revival, the 1904\u20131905 Welsh Revival, which started through the evangelism of Evan Roberts and brought large numbers of converts, sometimes whole communities, to non-Anglican Christianity.[266]  The Church in Wales with 56,000 adherents has the largest attendance of the denominations.[267] It is a province of the Anglican Communion, and was part of the Church of England until disestablishment in 1920 under the Welsh Church Act 1914. The first Independent Church in Wales was founded at Llanvaches in 1638 by William Wroth. The Presbyterian Church of Wales was born out of the Welsh Methodist revival in the 18th century and seceded from the Church of England in 1811.[268] The second largest attending faith in Wales is Roman Catholic, with an estimated 43,000 adherents.[267]  Non-Christian religions are small in Wales, making up approximately 2.7 per cent of the population.[269] Islam is the largest, with 24,000 (0.8 per cent) reported Muslims in the 2011 census.[269] There are also communities of Hindus and Sikhs, mainly in the south Wales cities of Newport, Cardiff and Swansea, while the largest concentration of Buddhists is in the western rural county of Ceredigion.[270] Judaism was the first non-Christian faith to be established in Wales since Roman times, though by 2001 the community had declined to approximately 2,000[271] and as of 2019 only numbers in the hundreds.[272]  The 2021 census showed that 93.8 per cent of the population of Wales identified as \"White\", compared to 95.6 per cent in 2011. 90.6 per cent of the population identified as \"White: Welsh, English, Scottish, Northern Irish or British\" in 2021. The second-highest ethnicity in 2021 was \"Asian, Asian Welsh or Asian British\" at 2.9 per cent of the population, compared to 2.3 per cent in 2011. 1.6 per cent of the population identified as \"Mixed or multiple ethnic groups\", compared to 1.0 per cent in 2011; 0.9 per cent of the population identified as \"Black, Black Welsh, Black British, Caribbean or African\", compared to 0.6 per cent in 2011; and 0.9 per cent identified as \"Other ethnic group\" compared to 0.5 per cent in 2011. The local authorities with the highest proportions of \"high-level\" ethnic groups other than \"White\" were mainly urban areas including Cardiff, Newport and Swansea. 5.3 per cent of households in Wales were multiple ethnic group households, up from 4.2 per cent in 2011.[273]  In 2021, the first statue of a named, non-fictional woman outdoors was raised for Wales's first black headteacher, Betty Campbell. In 2023, Patti Flynn (a contemporary of Shirley Bassey, both of Tiger Bay, Cardiff) became the first black Welsh woman to be awarded a purple plaque.[274]  The 2021 census showed that 55.2 per cent identified as \"Welsh only\" and 8.1 per cent identified as \"Welsh and British\", giving the combined proportion of 63.3 per cent for people identifying as Welsh.[275] The Welsh Annual Population Survey showed that the proportion of people who identified as Welsh versus another identity was 62.3 per cent in 2022, compared to 69.2 per cent in 2001.[276] A 2022 YouGov poll found that 21 per cent considered themselves Welsh not British, 15 per cent more Welsh than British, 24 per cent equally Welsh and British, 7 per cent more British than Welsh, 20 per cent British and not Welsh, and 8 per cent other; a total of 67 per cent thus considered themselves Welsh to some degree.[277]  Wales has a distinctive culture including its own language, customs, holidays and music. There are four UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Wales: The Castles and Town Walls of King Edward I in Gwynedd; Pontcysyllte Aqueduct and Canal; the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape; and The Slate Landscape of Northwest Wales.[278]  Remnants of native Celtic mythology of the pre-Christian Britons was passed down orally by the cynfeirdd (the early poets).[279] Some of their work survives in later medieval Welsh manuscripts: the Black Book of Carmarthen and the Book of Aneirin (both 13th-century); the Book of Taliesin and the White Book of Rhydderch (both 14th-century); and the Red Book of Hergest (c.\u00a01400).[279] The prose stories from the White and Red Books are known as the Mabinogion.[280] Poems such as Cad Goddeu (The Battle of the Trees) and mnemonic list-texts like the Welsh Triads and the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain, also contain mythological material.[281] These texts include the earliest forms of the Arthurian legend and the traditional history of post-Roman Britain.[279] Other sources of Welsh folklore include the 9th-century Latin historical compilation Historia Britonum (the History of the Britons) and Geoffrey of Monmouth's 12th-century Latin chronicle Historia Regum Britanniae (the History of the Kings of Britain), and later folklore, such as The Welsh Fairy Book by W. Jenkyn Thomas.[282]  Wales has one of the oldest unbroken literary traditions in Europe[283] going back to the sixth century and including Geoffrey of Monmouth and Gerald of Wales, regarded as among the finest Latin authors of the Middle Ages.[283] The earliest body of Welsh verse, by poets Taliesin and Aneirin, survive not in their original form, but in much-changed, medieval versions.[283] Welsh poetry and native lore and learning survived through the era of the Poets of the Princes (c.\u20091100\u20131280) and then the Poets of the Gentry (c.\u20091350\u20131650). The former were professional poets who composed eulogies and elegies to their patrons while the latter favoured the cywydd metre.[284] The period produced one of Wales's greatest poets, Dafydd ap Gwilym.[285] After the Anglicisation of the gentry the tradition declined.[284]  Despite the extinction of the professional poet, the integration of the native elite into a wider cultural world did bring other literary benefits.[286] Renaissance scholars such as William Salesbury and John Davies brought humanist ideals from English universities.[286] In 1588 William Morgan became the first person to translate the Bible into Welsh.[286] From the 16th century the proliferation of the 'free-metre' verse became the most important development in Welsh poetry, but from the middle of the 17th century a host of imported accentual metres from England became very popular.[286] By the 19th century the creation of a Welsh epic, fuelled by the eisteddfod, became an obsession with Welsh-language writers.[287] The output of this period was prolific in quantity but unequal in quality.[288] Initially excluded, religious denominations came to dominate the competitions, with bardic themes becoming scriptural and didactic.[288]  Developments in 19th-century Welsh literature include Lady Charlotte Guest's translation into English of the Mabinogion, one of the most important medieval Welsh prose works of Celtic mythology. 1885 saw the publication of Rhys Lewis by Daniel Owen, credited as the first novel written in the Welsh language. The 20th century saw a move from the verbose Victorian Welsh style, with works such as Thomas Gwynn Jones's Ymadawiad Arthur.[287] The First World War had a profound effect on Welsh literature with a more pessimistic style championed by T. H. Parry-Williams and R. Williams Parry.[287] The industrialisation of south Wales saw a further shift with the likes of Rhydwen Williams who used the poetry and metre of a bygone rural Wales but in the context of an industrial landscape. The inter-war period is dominated by Saunders Lewis, for his political and reactionary views as much as his plays, poetry and criticism.[287]  The careers of some 1930s writers continued after World War Two, including those of Gwyn Thomas, Vernon Watkins, and Dylan Thomas, whose most famous work Under Milk Wood was first broadcast in 1954. Thomas was one of the most notable and popular Welsh writers of the 20th century and one of the most innovative poets of his time.[289] The attitude of the post-war generation of Welsh writers in English towards Wales differs from the previous generation, with greater sympathy for Welsh nationalism and the Welsh language. The change is linked to the nationalism of Saunders Lewis and the burning of the Bombing School on the Ll\u0177n Peninsula in 1936.[290] In poetry R. S. Thomas (1913\u20132000) was the most important figure throughout the second half of the twentieth century. He \"did not learn the Welsh language until he was 30 and wrote all his poems in English\".[291] Major writers in the second half of the twentieth century include Emyr Humphreys (1919\u20132020), who during his long writing career published over twenty novels,[292] and Raymond Williams (1921\u20131988).[293]  Amgueddfa Cymru \u2013 Museum Wales was founded by royal charter in 1907 as the National Museum of Wales. It operates at seven sites: National Museum Cardiff, St Fagans National History Museum, Big Pit National Coal Museum, National Wool Museum, National Slate Museum, National Roman Legion Museum, and the National Waterfront Museum. Entry to all sites is free.[294] The National Library of Wales, based in Aberystwyth, houses important collections of printed works, including the Sir John Williams Collection and the Shirburn Castle collection,[295] as well as art collections including portraits and photographs, ephemera and Ordnance Survey maps.[295]  Works of Celtic art have been found in Wales.[296] In the Early Medieval period, the Celtic Christianity of Wales was part of the Insular art of the British Isles. A number of illuminated manuscripts from Wales survive, including the 8th-century Hereford Gospels and Lichfield Gospels. The 11th-century Ricemarch Psalter (now in Dublin) is certainly Welsh, made in St David's, and shows a late Insular style with unusual Viking influence.[297]  Some Welsh artists of the 16th\u201318th centuries tended to leave the country to work, moving to London or Italy. Richard Wilson (1714\u20131782) is arguably the first major British landscapist; although more notable for his Italian scenes, he painted several Welsh scenes on visits from London. By the late 18th century, the popularity of landscape art grew and clients were found in the larger Welsh towns, allowing more Welsh artists to stay in their homeland. Artists from outside Wales were also drawn to paint Welsh scenery, at first because of the Celtic Revival.[298]  An Act of Parliament in 1857 provided for the establishment of a number of art schools throughout the United Kingdom, and the Cardiff School of Art opened in 1865. Graduates still very often had to leave Wales to work, but Betws-y-Coed became a popular centre for artists, and its artists' colony helped to form the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art in 1881.[299] The sculptor Sir William Goscombe John made works for Welsh commissions, although he had settled in London. Christopher Williams, whose subjects were mostly resolutely Welsh, was also based in London. Thomas E. Stephens[300] and Andrew Vicari had very successful careers as portraitists, based respectively in the United States and France.[301]  Welsh painters gravitated towards the art capitals of Europe. Augustus John and his sister Gwen John lived mostly in London and Paris. However, the landscapists Sir Kyffin Williams and Peter Prendergast lived in Wales for most of their lives, while remaining in touch with the wider art world. Ceri Richards was very engaged in the Welsh art scene as a teacher in Cardiff and even after moving to London; he was a figurative painter in international styles including Surrealism. Various artists have moved to Wales, including Eric Gill, the London-Welshman David Jones, and the sculptor Jonah Jones. The Kardomah Gang was an intellectual circle in Swansea, centred on the poet Dylan Thomas and the poet and artist Vernon Watkins, which also included the painter Alfred Janes.[302]  South Wales had several notable potteries, one of the first important sites being the Ewenny Pottery in Bridgend, which began producing earthenware in the 17th century.[303] In the 18th and 19th centuries, with more scientific methods becoming available, more refined ceramics were produced: this was led by the Cambrian Pottery (1764\u20131870, also known as \"Swansea pottery\"), and later Nantgarw Pottery near Cardiff, which was in operation from 1813 to 1820 making fine porcelain, and then utilitarian pottery from 1833 until 1920.[303] Portmeirion Pottery, founded in 1960 by Susan Williams-Ellis (daughter of Clough Williams-Ellis, creator of the Italianate village of Portmeirion, Gwynedd) is based in Stoke-on-Trent, England.[304]  Wales is regarded as a modern Celtic nation which contributes to its national identity,[30][305] with Welsh artists regularly appearing at Celtic festivals.[306] The red dragon is the principal symbol of national identity and pride, personifying the fearlessness of the Welsh nation.[307] The dragon is first referenced in literature as a symbol of the people in the Historia Brittonum. Vortigern (Welsh: Gwrtheyrn), King of the Celtic Britons, is interrupted whilst attempting to build a fort at Dinas Emrys. He is told by Ambrosius[f] to dig up two dragons beneath the castle. He discovers a red dragon representing the Celtic Britons, and a white dragon representing Anglo-Saxons. Ambrosius prophesies that the Celtic Britons will reclaim the island and push the Anglo-Saxons back to the sea.[309]  As an emblem, the red dragon of Wales has been used since the reign of Cadwaladr, King of Gwynedd from around 655AD, and is present on the national flag of Wales, which became an official flag in 1959.[310] The banner of Owain Glynd\u0175r is associated with Welsh nationhood; it was carried into battle by Welsh forces during Glynd\u0175r's battles against the English, and includes four lions on red and gold.[311] The standard is similar to the arms of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (Llywelyn the Last), the last Prince of Wales before the conquest of Wales by Edward I of England. The design may also be influenced by the arms of Glyndwr's parents, both of whom had lions in their arms. Owain Glynd\u0175r Day is celebrated on 16 September in Wales and there have been calls to make it a national bank holiday.[312][313][314] The Prince of Wales's feathers is also used in Wales: it consists of three white feathers emerging from a gold coronet, and the German motto Ich dien (I serve). Several Welsh representative teams, including the Welsh rugby union, and Welsh regiments in the British Army, including the Royal Welsh, use the badge or a stylised version of it.[315][316][g]  On 1 March, Welsh people celebrate Saint David's Day, commemorating the death of the country's patron saint in 589.[318] It is not a recognised bank holiday although there have been calls to make it so.[319][320][321] The day is celebrated by schools and cultural societies across Wales, and customs include the wearing of a leek or a daffodil, which are two national emblems of Wales. Children also wear the national costume.[322] The origins of the leek can be traced to the 16th century, while the daffodil became popular in the 19th century, encouraged by David Lloyd George.[323] This is attributed to confusion (or association) between the Welsh for leek, cenhinen, and that for daffodil, cenhinen Bedr or St. Peter's leek.[138] A report in 1916 gave preference to the leek, which has appeared on British pound coins.[323] Other Welsh festivals include Mabsant when parishes would celebrate the patron saint of their local church, although this is now rarely observed,[324] and a more modern celebration, Dydd Santes Dwynwen (St Dwynwen's Day), observed on 25 January in a similar way to St Valentine's Day.[325]  \"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\" (English: Land of My Fathers) is the National Anthem of Wales, and is played at events such as football or rugby matches involving the Wales national team, as well as the opening of the Senedd and other official occasions.[326] \"Cymru am byth\" (\"Wales forever\") is a popular Welsh motto.[327] Another Welsh motto \"Y Ddraig Goch Ddyry Cychwyn\" (\"the red dragon inspires action\") has been used on the Royal Badge of Wales when it was created in 1953.[328]  More than 50 national governing bodies regulate and organise their sports in Wales.[329] Most of those involved in competitive sports select, organise and manage individuals or teams to represent their country at international events or fixtures against other countries. Wales is represented at major world sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup, Rugby World Cup, Rugby League World Cup and the Commonwealth Games. At the Olympic Games, Welsh athletes compete alongside those of Scotland, England and Northern Ireland as part of a Great Britain team. Wales has hosted several international sporting events.[330] These include the 1958 Commonwealth Games,[331] the 1999 Rugby World Cup, the 2010 Ryder Cup and the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final.[330][332]  Although football has traditionally been the more popular sport in North Wales, rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness.[333] The Wales national rugby union team takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship and has also competed in every Rugby World Cup, hosting the tournament in 1999. The five professional sides that replaced the traditional club sides in major competitions in 2003 were replaced in 2004 by the four regions: Cardiff Blues, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets.[334] The Welsh regional teams play in the United Rugby Championship,[335] the Heineken Champions Cup if they qualify[336] and the European Rugby Challenge Cup, again dependent on qualification.[337] Rugby league in Wales dates back to 1907. A professional Welsh League existed from 1908 to 1910.[338]  Wales has had its own football league, the Welsh Premier League, since 1992.[339] For historical reasons, five Welsh clubs play in the English football league system: Cardiff City, Swansea City, Newport County, Wrexham, and Merthyr Town.[340] The country has produced a considerable number of footballers who have played at international level.[341] At UEFA Euro 2016, the Wales national team achieved their best ever finish, reaching the semi-finals.[342]  In international cricket, Wales and England field a single representative team, administered by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), called the England cricket team, or simply 'England'.[343] Occasionally, a separate Wales team play limited-overs competitions. Glamorgan County Cricket Club is the only Welsh participant in the England and Wales County Championship.[344] Wales has produced notable participants of individual sports including snooker,[345] track and field,[346] cycling,[347][348] and boxing.[349][350]  Wales became the UK's first digital television nation in 2010.[351] BBC Cymru Wales is the national broadcaster,[352] producing both television and radio programmes in Welsh and English.[353] It has also produced programmes such as Life on Mars, Doctor Who and Torchwood for BBC's network audience across the United Kingdom.[352][354] ITV, the UK's main commercial broadcaster, has a Welsh-orientated service branded ITV Cymru Wales.[355] S4C began broadcasting in 1982. Its output was mostly in Welsh at peak hours, but shared English-language content with Channel 4 at other times. Since the digital switchover the channel has broadcast exclusively in Welsh.[356] BBC Radio Cymru is the BBC's Welsh-language radio service, which broadcasts throughout Wales.[352] A number of independent radio stations broadcast in the Welsh regions, predominantly in English. In 2006, several regional radio stations broadcast in Welsh: output ranged from two two-minute news bulletins each weekday (Radio Maldwyn) to over 14 hours of Welsh-language programmes weekly (Swansea Sound) to essentially bilingual stations such as Heart Cymru and Radio Ceredigion.[357]  Most of the newspapers sold and read in Wales are national newspapers available throughout Britain. The Western Mail is Wales's only print national daily newspaper.[358] Wales-based regional daily newspapers include the Daily Post (which covers North Wales), the South Wales Evening Post (Swansea), the South Wales Echo (Cardiff), and the South Wales Argus (Newport).[358] Y Cymro is a Welsh-language newspaper, published weekly.[359] Wales on Sunday is the only Welsh Sunday newspaper that covers the whole of Wales.[360] The Books Council of Wales is the Welsh-Government-funded body tasked with promoting Welsh literature in Welsh and English.[361] The BCW provides publishing grants for qualifying English- and Welsh-language publications.[362] Around 650 books are published each year, by some of the dozens of Welsh publishers.[363][364] Wales's main publishing houses include Gomer Press, Gwasg Carreg Gwalch, Honno, the University of Wales Press and Y Lolfa.[363] Journals with a Welsh focus include Cambria (a Welsh affairs magazine published bi-monthly in English),[365] Planet, and Poetry Wales.[366] Welsh-language magazines include the current affairs titles Golwg (\"View\"), published weekly, and Barn (\"Opinion\"), published monthly.[359] Y Wawr (\"The Dawn\") is published quarterly by Merched y Wawr, the national organisation for women.[359] Y Traethodydd (\"The Essayist\"), a quarterly publication by the Presbyterian Church of Wales, first appeared in 1845 and is the oldest Welsh publication still in print.[359]  Traditional Welsh dishes include laverbread (made from Porphyra umbilicalis, an edible seaweed), bara brith (fruit bread), cawl (a lamb stew), cawl cennin (leek soup), and Welsh cakes.[367] Cockles are sometimes served as a traditional breakfast with bacon and laverbread.[368] Although Wales has its own traditional food and has absorbed much of the cuisine of England, Welsh diets now owe more to the countries of India, China and the United States. Chicken tikka masala is the country's favourite dish, while hamburgers and Chinese food outsell fish and chips as takeaways.[369]  Wales, \"the land of song\", is notable for its solo artists, its male voice choirs and its harpists.[370] The annual National Eisteddfod is the country's main performance festival. The Llangollen International Eisteddfod provides an opportunity for the singers and musicians of the world to perform. The Welsh Folk Song Society publishes collections of historical songs and tunes.[371] Traditional instruments of Wales include the telyn deires (triple harp), fiddle, crwth (bowed lyre) and the pibgorn (hornpipe).[372] Male voice choirs emerged in the 19th century, formed as the tenor and bass sections of chapel choirs, and embraced the popular secular hymns of the day.[373] Welsh congregations and choirs were known for singing in a rousing four-voice style, becoming characteristic of the country.[374] Many of the historic choirs survive in modern Wales, singing a mixture of traditional and popular songs.[373]  The BBC National Orchestra of Wales performs in Wales and internationally. The Welsh National Opera is based at the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff Bay, while the National Youth Orchestra of Wales was the first of its type in the world.[375] Wales has a tradition of producing notable singers in both the classical and pop arenas,[376] as well as some popular bands.[377][378][379] The Welsh folk music scene has enjoyed a resurgence in the 21st century.[380]  The earliest surviving Welsh plays are two medieval miracle plays, Y Tri Brenin o Gwlen (\"The three Kings from Cologne\") and Y Dioddefaint a'r Atgyfodiad (\"The Passion and the Resurrection\").[381] A recognised Welsh tradition of theatre emerged during the 18th century, in the form of an interlude, a metrical play performed at fairs and markets.[382] Drama in the early 20th century thrived, but the country established neither a Welsh National Theatre nor a national ballet company.[383] After the Second World War, the substantial number of amateur theatre companies reduced by two thirds.[384] Competition from television in the mid-20th century led to greater professionalism in the theatre.[384] Plays by Emlyn Williams and Alun Owen and others were staged, while Welsh actors, including Richard Burton and Anthony Hopkins, were establishing international reputations.[384][385][386] Wales has also produced some well-known comedians.[387]  Traditional dances include Welsh folk dancing and clog dancing. The first mention of dancing in Wales is in a 12th-century account by Giraldus Cambrensis, but by the 19th century traditional dance had all but died out due to religious opposition.[383] In the 20th century a revival was led by Lois Blake (1890\u20131974).[383] Clog dancing was preserved and developed by Hywel Wood (1882\u20131967) and others who perpetuated the art on local and national stages.[388] The Welsh Folk Dance Society was founded in 1949.[388] Contemporary dance grew out of Cardiff in the 1970s.[388] The National Dance Company Wales, formed in 1983, is now resident at the Wales Millennium Centre.[389]  Citations  Sources  52\u00b018\u2032N 3\u00b048\u2032W\ufeff \/ \ufeff52.3\u00b0N 3.8\u00b0W\ufeff \/ 52.3; -3.8 "},{"title":"Gridiron football","content":"Gridiron football (\/\u02c8\u0261r\u026ada\u026a\u0259rn\/ GRID-iren),[1] also known as North American football,[2] or in North America as simply football, is a family of football team sports primarily played in the United States and Canada. American football, which uses 11 players, is the form played in the United States and the best known form of gridiron football worldwide, while Canadian football, which uses 12 players, predominates in Canada. Other derivative varieties include arena football, flag football and amateur games such as touch and street football. Football is played at professional, collegiate, high school, semi-professional, and amateur levels.  These sports originated in the 19th century out of older games related to modern rugby football, more specifically rugby union football. Early on, American and Canadian football developed alongside (but independently from) each other; the root of the game known as \"football\" today originates with an 1874 game between Harvard and McGill Universities, following which the American school adopted the Canadian school's more rugby-like rules.[3]  Over time, Canadian teams adopted features of the American variant of the game and vice versa. Both varieties are distinguished from other football sports by their use of hard plastic helmets and shoulder pads, the forward pass, the system of downs, a number of unique rules and positions, measurement in customary units of yards (even in Canada, which largely metricated in the 1970s), and a distinctive brown leather ball in the shape of a prolate spheroid with pointed ends.  The international governing body for the sport is the International Federation of American Football (IFAF); although the organization plays all of its international competitions under American rules, it uses a definition of the game that is broad enough that it includes Canadian football under its umbrella, and Football Canada (the governing body for Canadian football) is an IFAF member.  The sport is typically known as simply \"football\" in the countries where it originated, regardless of the specific variety.[4] Various sources use the term \"North American football\" when discussing the American and Canadian games together, but this term is quite rare.[5][6][7][8]  The two sports are also sometimes known as \"gridiron football\".[1] The name originated with the sport's once-characteristic playing field: the original American football and Canadian football fields were marked by a series of parallel lines along both the width and length of the field, which produced a checkerboard pattern resembling a cross-hatched cooking gridiron.[9][10][11] The ball would be snapped in the grid in which it was downed on the previous play. By 1920, the grid system was abandoned in favor of the system of yard lines and hash marks used today.   The International Federation of American Football (IFAF), uses \"American football\" inclusive of Canadian football and other varieties.[12]  In Australia, American football is often referred to as \"gridiron\" or (in more formal contexts) \"American football\", as \"football\" usually refers to Australian rules football, rugby league or rugby union, similar to how association football is usually called \"soccer\" in Australian English. The governing body for American football in Australia is Gridiron Australia.  Similarly, in the UK American football is known as American football, as \"football\" is used to refer to soccer.  The sport developed from informal games played in North America during the 19th century. Early games had a variety of local rules and were generally similar to modern rugby union and soccer. The earliest recorded instance of gridiron football occurred at University of Toronto's University College in November 1861.[3]  Later in the 1860s, teams from universities were playing each other, leading to more standardized rules and the creation of college football. While several American schools adopted rules based on the soccer rules of the English Football Association, Harvard University held to its traditional \"carrying game\". Meanwhile, McGill University in Montreal used rules based on rugby union. In 1874, Harvard and McGill organized two games using each other's rules. Harvard took a liking to McGill's rugby-style rules and adopted them.[3][13] In turn, they were used when Harvard and Yale University played their first intercollegiate sports game in 1875, after which the rugby-style Canadian game was adopted by Yale players and spectators from Yale and Princeton University.[13] This version of the game was subsequently played with several other U.S. colleges over the next several years.[3]  American football teams and organizations subsequently adopted new rules which distinguished the game from rugby.[14] Many of these early innovations were the work of Walter Camp, including the sport's line of scrimmage and the system of downs.[15] Another consequential change was the adoption of the forward pass in 1906, which allowed the quarterback to throw the ball forward over the line of scrimmage to a receiver.[16] Canadian football remained akin to rugby for decades, though a progressive faction of players, chiefly based in the western provinces, demanded changes to the game based on the innovations in American football. Over the years, the sport adopted more Americanized rules, though it retained some of its historical features, including a 110-yard (100\u00a0m) field, 12-player teams, and three downs instead of four.[17]  Around the same time Camp devised the rules for American football, the Canadian game would develop in the same way (but separately) from the American game; the Burnside rules were instrumental in establishing many of the rules for the modern game.[18]  The best NFL players are among the highest paid athletes in the world.[19][20]  This is a minimal description of the game in general, with elements common to all or almost all variants of the game. For more specific rules, see each code's individual articles.  Prior to the start of a game, a coin toss determines which team will decide if they want to kick off the ball to their opponent, or receive the ball from their opponent. Each team lines up on opposite halves of the field, with a minimum ten yards of space between them for the kickoff. The team receiving the ball can make a fair catch (which stops the play immediately), catch the ball and run it back until the ball carrier is tackled, or, if the ball is kicked out of bounds, let the ball go dead on its own (the last case usually happens when the ball is kicked all the way into or through the opponent's end zone, resulting in a touchback and the ball being brought several yards out of the end zone to begin play). A kicking team can, under special circumstances, attempt to recover its own kick, but the rules of the game make it very difficult to do so reliably, and so this tactic is usually only used as a surprise or desperation maneuver.  At this point, play from scrimmage begins.  The team in possession of the ball is on offense and the opponent is on defense. The offense is given a set amount of time (up to forty seconds, depending on the governing body), during which the teams can set up a play in a huddle and freely substitute players to set into a formation, in which the offense must remain perfectly still for at least one second (the formation requirement does not apply to Canadian football). At least half of the players (seven in standard American and Canadian football, four in standard indoor ball) on the offense must line up on the line of scrimmage in this formation, including the snapper, who handles the ball before play commences; the rest can (and almost always do) line up behind the line. Neither the offense nor the defense can cross the line of scrimmage before the play commences. Once the formation is set, the snapper snaps the ball to one of the players behind him. (A snapper must snap the ball within 20 to 25 seconds of the official setting the ball back into position after the previous play, and a play clock is kept to enforce the measure.) Once the ball is snapped, the play has commenced, and the offense's goal is to continue advancing the ball toward their opponent's end zone. This can be done either by running with the ball or by a rule unique to football known as the forward pass. In a forward pass, a player from behind the line of scrimmage throws the ball to an eligible receiver (another back or one player on each end of the line), who must catch the ball before it touches the ground. The play stops when a player with the ball touches any part of their body other than hand or foot to the ground, runs out of the boundaries of the field, is obstructed from making further forward progress, or a forward pass hits the ground without being caught (in the last case, the ball returns to the spot it was snapped). To stop play, players on defense are allowed to tackle the ball carrier at any time the ball is in play, provided they do not grab the face mask of the helmet or make helmet-to-helmet contact when doing so. At any time, the player with the ball can attempt a backward, or lateral, pass to any other player in order to keep the ball in play; this is generally rare. Any player on defense can, at any time, attempt to intercept a forward pass in flight, at which point the team gains possession; they can also gain possession by recovering a fumble or stripping the ball away from the ball carrier (a \"forced fumble\"). A typical play can last between five and twenty seconds.  If any illegal action happens during the play, then the results of the previous play are erased and a penalty is assessed, forcing the offending team to surrender between five and fifteen yards of field to the opponent. Whether this yardage is measured from the original spot of the ball before the play, the spot of the illegal action, or the end of the play depends on the individual foul. The most common penalties include false start (when an offensive player jumps to begin the play before the ball is snapped, a five-yard penalty), holding (the grabbing of a player other than the ball carrier to obstruct their progress; a ten-yard penalty against offensive players and a five-yard penalty against defensive ones), and pass interference (when either a receiver or the defending player pushes or blocks the other to prevent them from catching the pass). A team on offense cannot score points as the direct result of a penalty; a defensive foul committed in the team's own end zone, if the penalty is assessed from the spot of the foul, places the ball at the one-yard line. In contrast, a defensive team can score points as a direct result of a penalty; if the offense commits a foul under the same scenario, the defensive team receives two points and a free kick. In all other circumstances (except for the open-ended and extremely rare unfair act clause), a penalty cannot exceed more than half the distance to the end zone. If the penalty would be less advantageous than the result of the actual play, then the team not committing the penalty can decline it.  In order to keep play moving, the offense must make a certain amount of progress (10 yards in most leagues) within a certain number of plays (3 in Canada, 4 in the United States), called downs. If the offense does indeed make this progress, a first down is achieved, and the team gets 3 or 4 more plays to achieve another 10 yards. If not, the offense loses possession to their opponent at the spot where the ball is. More commonly, however, the team on offense will, if they have a minimal chance of gaining a first down and have only one play left to do it (fourth down in the U.S., third down in Canada), attempt a scrimmage kick. There are two types of scrimmage kick: a punt is when the ball is released from the punter's hand and kicked downfield as close to the opponent's end zone as possible without entering it; the kicking team loses possession of the ball after the kick and the receiving team can attempt to advance the ball or call a fair catch. The other scrimmage kick is a field goal attempt. This must be attempted by place kick or (more rarely) drop kick, and if the kicked ball passes through the goal set at the edge of the opponent's end zone, the team scores three points. (Four-point field goals have been offered in a few variations of the game under special rules, but the NFL, college and high school football only offer three-point field goals.) In Canada, any kick that goes into the end zone and is not returned, whether it be a punt or a missed field goal, is awarded one single point.  If the team in possession of the ball, at any time, advances (either by carrying or catching) the ball into the opponent's end zone, it is a touchdown, and the team scores six points and a free play known as a try. In a try, a team attempts to score one or two points (rules vary by each league, but under standard rules, a field goal on a try is worth one point while another touchdown is worth two). At the college and professional levels, the defense can also score on a try, but only on the same scale (thus a botched try the defense returns for a touchdown scores only two points and not six). Kickoffs occur after every touchdown and field goal.  If a team is in its own end zone and commits a foul, is tackled with the ball, or bats, fumbles, kicks or throws the ball backward out of the field of play through the same end zone, the defense scores a safety, worth two points.  After a try, safety or field goal, the team that had possession of the ball goes back to the middle of the field and kicks the ball off to their opponent, and play continues as it did in the beginning of the game.  Play continues until halftime. (Each team switches their side of the field with the other halfway through each half, at the end of a quarter.) After the halftime break, a new kickoff occurs. Whichever team has more points at the end of the game is declared the winner; in the event of a tie, each league has its own rules for overtime to break the tie. Because of the nature of the game, pure sudden-death overtimes have been abolished at all levels of the game as of 2012.  At all adult levels of the game, a game is 60 timed minutes in length, split into four 15-minute quarters. (High school football uses 12-minute quarters, and the general rule is that the younger the players, the shorter the quarters typically are.) Because of the halftime, quarter breaks, time-outs, the minute warnings (two minutes before the end of a half in the NFL, three minutes in Canadian football), and frequent stoppages of the game clock (the clock stops, for example, after every incomplete pass and any time a ball goes out of bounds), the actual time it takes for a football game to be completed is typically over three hours in the NFL[23] and slightly under three hours in the CFL.[24]  According to 2017 study on brains of deceased gridiron football players, 99% of tested brains of NFL players, 88% of CFL players, 64% of semi-professional players, 91% of college football players, and 21% of high school football players had various stages of CTE.[25]  Other common injuries include injuries of legs, arms and lower back.[26][27][28][29] "},{"title":"Midtown Manhattan","content":"  Midtown Manhattan is the central portion of the New York City borough of Manhattan and serves as the city's primary central business district. Midtown is home to some of the city's most prominent buildings, including the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, the Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project, the headquarters of the United Nations, Grand Central Terminal, and Rockefeller Center, as well as several prominent tourist destinations including Broadway, Times Square, and Koreatown. Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan is the busiest transportation hub in the Western Hemisphere.[5]  Midtown Manhattan is one of the largest central business districts in the world, and has been ranked as the densest central business district in the world in terms of employees at 606,108 per square mile (234,020\/km2).[6] Midtown also ranks among the world's most expensive locations for real estate; Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan has commanded the world's highest retail rents, with average annual rents at US$3,000 per square foot ($32,000\/m2) in 2017.[7] However, due to the high price of retail spaces in Midtown, there are also many vacant storefronts in the neighborhood.[8] Midtown is the country's largest commercial, entertainment, and media center, and also a growing financial and fintech center.[9]  The majority of New York City's skyscrapers, including its tallest hotels and apartment towers, are in Midtown. The area hosts commuters and residents working in its offices, hotels, and retail establishments, tourists and students. Times Square, the brightly illuminated hub of the Broadway Theater District,[10][11][12][13][14] is a major center of the world's entertainment industry.[15] Sixth Avenue also has the headquarters of three of the four major U.S. television networks.  Midtown is part of Manhattan Community District 5.[2] It is patrolled by the 14th and 18th precincts of the New York City Police Department.  Geographically, the northern boundary of Midtown Manhattan is commonly defined to be 59th Street; its southern boundary is less clear, and variously taken to be 34th Street, 23rd Street, or even 14th Street. Midtown spans the entire island of Manhattan along an east\u2013west axis, bounded by the East River on its east and the Hudson River to its west. The Encyclopedia of New York City defines Midtown as extending from 34th Street to 59th Street and from 3rd Avenue to 8th Avenue.[16]  In addition to its central business district, Midtown Manhattan encompasses many neighborhoods, including Hell's Kitchen and Chelsea on the West Side, and Murray Hill, Kips Bay, Turtle Bay, and Gramercy Park on the East Side. It is sometimes broken into \"Midtown East\" and \"Midtown West\", or north and south as in the New York City Police Department's Midtown North and Midtown South precincts.  Neighborhoods in the Midtown area include the following:  Midtown is the original district in the United States to bear the name and included historical but now defunct neighborhoods such as the Ladies' Mile, along Fifth Avenue from 14th to 23rd Street; and the Tenderloin, from 23rd to 42nd Street and from Fifth Avenue to Seventh Avenue.  Important streets and thoroughfares  The border of Midtown Manhattan is nebulous and further confused by the fact that the term \"Midtown Manhattan\" can be used to refer either to a district or a group of neighborhoods and districts in Manhattan:  Midtown Manhattan, along with Lower Manhattan, is one of the world's leading financial centers.  Midtown Manhattan is the one of the world's largest central business district, with 400\u00a0million square feet (37.2\u00a0million m2) of office space in 2018.[19] Midtown contains the headquarters of major companies, including 4Kids Entertainment (formerly),[20] Barnes & Noble,[21] Bloomberg L.P.,[22] Ernst & Young,[23] Calvin Klein,[24] Cantor Fitzgerald,[25] CBS Corporation,[26] Citigroup,[27] Colgate-Palmolive,[28] Cushman & Wakefield,[29] DC Comics,[30] Deloitte,[31] Duane Reade,[32] Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies,[33] Foot Locker,[34] Frederator Studios,[35] JPMorgan Chase,[36] Hess Corporation,[37] Kroll Inc.,[38] L-3 Communications,[39] Marsh & McLennan Companies,[40] Marvel Entertainment,[41] MetLife,[42] MidOcean Partners,[43] Morgan Stanley,[44] Nasdaq, Inc.,[45] NBC Universal,[46] The New York Times Company,[47] NexCen Brands,[48] Paramount Global,[49] Pfizer,[50] Polo Ralph Lauren,[51] Saks Incorporated (Saks Fifth Avenue),[52] The Sharper Image,[53] Simon & Schuster,[26] Six Flags,[54] TBWA Worldwide,[55] Thomson Reuters,[56] Time Warner,[57] Time Warner Cable,[58] The Travelers Companies, and Univision Communications.[59] The New York Institute of Finance is located in Midtown Manhattan.[60]  Haier operates its United States offices in the Haier Building at 1356 Broadway, formerly the headquarters of the Greenwich Savings Bank. Haier held the opening ceremony on March 4, 2002.[61] Sumitomo Corporation operates its New York Office, the headquarters of the corporation's United States operations, at 600 Third Avenue, 10016 in the Murray Hill neighborhood.[62] El Al's North American headquarters are in Midtown.[63] The Air France USA regional headquarters are in 125 West 55th Street in Midtown Manhattan.[64][65] Hachette Book Group USA has its headquarters in 237 Park Avenue.[66] In 1994 Alitalia considered moving its USA headquarters from Midtown to Lower Manhattan, but decided to keep the offices where they were at the last minute.[67] Global Infrastructure Partners has an office in Midtown Manhattan.[68]  Silicon Alley, the common metonym for New York City's high tech sector, is based in Midtown South, specifically the Flatiron District. Prominent Silicon Alley companies in Midtown include AppNexus, Blue Apron, Gilt, Betterment, Oscar, SoFi, Rent the Runway, Warby Parker, and WeWork. The technology sector has been expanding across Midtown Manhattan since 2010.[69] The biotechnology sector is also growing in Midtown Manhattan based upon the city's strength in academic scientific research and public and commercial financial support. By mid-2014, Accelerator, a biotech investment firm, had raised more than US$30\u00a0million from investors, including Eli Lilly and Company, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson, for initial funding to create biotechnology startups at the Alexandria Center for Life Science, which encompasses more than 700,000 square feet (65,000\u00a0m2) on East 29th Street and promotes collaboration among scientists and entrepreneurs at the center and with nearby academic, medical, and research institutions. The New York City Economic Development Corporation's Early Stage Life Sciences Funding Initiative and venture capital partners, including Celgene, General Electric Ventures, and Eli Lilly, committed a minimum of US$100\u00a0million to help launch 15 to 20 ventures in life sciences and biotechnology.[70]  Real estate is a major force in Midtown Manhattan's economy, and indeed the city's, as the total value of all New York City property was estimated at US$914.8\u00a0billion for the 2015 fiscal year.[71] Manhattan has perennially been home to some of the nation's, as well as one of the world's, most marketable real estate, including the Time Warner Center, which had the highest-listed market value in the city in 2006 at US$1.1\u00a0billion,[72] to be subsequently surpassed in October 2014 by the Waldorf Astoria New York, which became the most expensive hotel ever sold after being purchased by the Anbang Insurance Group, based in China, for US$1.95 billion.[73] When 450 Park Avenue was sold on July 2, 2007, for US$510\u00a0million, about US$1,589 per square foot (US$17,104\/m2), it broke the barely month-old record for an American office building of US$1,476 per square foot (US$15,887\/m2) based on the sale of 660 Madison Avenue.[74] In 2014, Manhattan was home to six of the top ten zip codes in the United States by median housing price.[75] In 2019, the most expensive home sale ever in the United States achieved completion in Midtown Manhattan, at a selling price of US$238\u00a0million, for a 24,000 square feet (2,200\u00a0m2) penthouse apartment overlooking Central Park at 220 Central Park South.[76]  The COVID-19 pandemic and hybrid work models have prompted consideration of commercial-to-residential conversion within the neighborhood's real estate sector.[77] In August 2023, Mayor Eric Adams announced a program aimed at creating \"a 24\/7, live-work, mixed-use neighborhood\" in Midtown South though the conversion of commercial and office space to residential, as part of an effort to create 20,000 new residences citywide in a decade.[78][79]  According to The Broadway League, shows on Broadway sold approximately US$1.27\u00a0billion worth of tickets in the 2013\u20132014 season, an increase of 11.4% from US$1.139\u00a0billion in the 2012\u20132013 season; attendance in 2013\u20132014 stood at 12.21\u00a0million, a 5.5% increase from the 2012\u20132013 season's 11.57\u00a0million.[80]  Companies that used to have their headquarters in Midtown Manhattan include American Airlines,[81][82] American Comics Group,[83] American Overseas Airlines,[84] Central Park Media,[85][86] Eastern Air Lines,[87] GoodTimes Entertainment,[88] LJN,[89] NewKidCo,[90] Pan American World Airways,[91] Philip Morris Companies (now Altria Group),[92][93] Trans Caribbean Airways,[94] and Trans World Airlines.[95][96][97] In 1997, Aer Lingus announced that it was moving its North American headquarters from Midtown to Melville, New York, in Suffolk County on Long Island.[98]  Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Midtown Manhattan was 28,630, a change of 2,823 (9.9%) from the 25,807 counted in 2000. Covering an area of 692.81 acres (280.37\u00a0ha), the neighborhood had a population density of 41.3 inhabitants per acre (26,400\/sq\u00a0mi; 10,200\/km2).[99] The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 64.1% (18,351) White, 4.6% (1,310) African American, 0.1% (34) Native American, 20.8% (5,942) Asian, 0% (8) Pacific Islander, 0.3% (92) from other races, and 2% (569) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino residents of any race were 8.1% (2,324) of the population.[4]  The entirety of Community District 5, which comprises Midtown Manhattan, had 53,120 inhabitants as of NYC Health's 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 84.8 years.[100]:\u200a2,\u200a20\u200a This is higher than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods.[101]:\u200a53\u200a[102] Most inhabitants are adults: a plurality (45%) are between the ages of 25 and 44, while 22% are between 45 and 64, and 13% are 65 or older. The ratio of youth and college-aged residents was lower, at 7% and 12% respectively.[100]:\u200a2\u200a  As of 2017, the median household income in Community Districts 4 and 5 (including Chelsea and Hell's Kitchen) was $101,981,[103] though the median income in Midtown individually was $120,854.[3] In 2018, an estimated 11% of Midtown Manhattan residents lived in poverty, compared to 14% in all of Manhattan and 20% in all of New York City. One in twenty residents (5%) were unemployed, compared to 7% in Manhattan and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 41% in Midtown Manhattan, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 45% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, as of 2018[update], Midtown Manhattan is considered to be high-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying.[100]  Midtown Manhattan is patrolled by two precincts of the NYPD.[104] Midtown North is patrolled by the 18th Precinct,[a] located at 306 West 54th Street,[105] while Midtown South is patrolled by the 14th Precinct,[a] located at 357 West 35th Street.[107] The precincts ranked 69th safest out of 69 patrol areas for per-capita crime in 2010. The high per-capita crime rate can be attributed to the low population of the area, as well as the high number of crimes committed against tourists.[108] As of 2018[update], with a non-fatal assault rate of 25 per 100,000 people, Midtown Manhattan's rate of violent crimes per capita is less than that of the city as a whole. The incarceration rate of 297 per 100,000 people is lower than that of the city as a whole.[100]:\u200a8\u200a  The 18th Precinct has a lower crime rate than it did in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 82.1% between 1990 and 2022. The precinct reported 1 murder, 22 rapes, 154 robberies, 185 felony assaults, 205 burglaries, 2,065 grand larcenies, and 116 grand larcenies auto in 2022.[109] The 14th Precinct also has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 81.2% between 1990 and 2022. The precinct reported 8 murders, 23 rapes, 653 robberies, 502 felony assaults, 660 burglaries, 2,375 grand larcenies, and 68 grand larcenies auto in 2022.[110]  The main part of midtown Manhattan, between 34th and 59th Streets from Lexington Avenue to Eighth Avenue, is served by five fire stations of the New York City Fire Department (FDNY):[111]  The greater Midtown area between 14th Street and 59th Street contains seven additional fire stations.[111]  As of 2018[update], preterm births and births to teenage mothers in Midtown Manhattan are lower than the city average. In Midtown Manhattan, there were 67 preterm births per 1,000 live births (compared to 87 per 1,000 citywide), and 4 births to teenage mothers per 1,000 live births (compared to 19.3 per 1,000 citywide).[100]:\u200a11\u200a Midtown Manhattan has a low population of residents who are uninsured.

West of Fifth Avenue, Midtown is located in 10018 between 34th and 41st Streets, 10036 between 41st and 48th Streets, and 10019 between 48th and 59th Streets. East of Fifth Avenue, Midtown is located in 10016 between 34th and 40th Streets, 10017 between 40th and 49th Streets, and 10022 between 49th and 59th Streets. The area southwest of Fifth Avenue and 34th Street, sometimes considered to be in Midtown, is part of 10001. Other areas between 14th and 34th Streets are covered by ZIP Codes 10003, 10009, 10010, and 10011, though these are generally not considered to be part of Midtown proper.[119] There are also thirty-three ZIP Codes assigned to individual buildings or building complexes.[121]  The United States Postal Service operates six post offices in Midtown:  The James A. Farley Station, the city's main post office, is located at 421 8th Avenue.[128] The post office stopped 24-hour service in 2009 due to decreasing mail traffic.[129]  Midtown Manhattan generally has a higher rate of college-educated residents than the rest of the city as of 2018[update]. A majority of residents age 25 and older (78%) have a college education or higher, while 6% have less than a high school education and 17% are high school graduates or have some college education. By contrast, 64% of Manhattan residents and 43% of city residents have a college education or higher.[100]:\u200a6\u200a The percentage of Midtown Manhattan students excelling in math rose from 61% in 2000 to 80% in 2011 and reading achievement increased from 66% to 68% during the same time period.[130]  Midtown Manhattan's rate of elementary school student absenteeism is lower than the rest of New York City. In Midtown Manhattan, 19% of elementary school students missed twenty or more days per school year, less than the citywide average of 20%.[101]:\u200a24 (PDF p. 55)\u200a[100]:\u200a6\u200a Additionally, 92% of high school students in Midtown Manhattan graduate on time, more than the citywide average of 75%.[100]:\u200a6\u200a  There are no public elementary or middle schools in Midtown.[131]  The New York City Department of Education operates the following public high schools in Midtown, serving grades 9-12:[131]  Private schools include The Beekman School, Rebecca School, and a number of private languages and music centers (e.g. Berlitz, American Language Communication Center, New York Language Center,[137] Swan Music School, and the New York Youth Symphony). The La Scuola d'Italia Guglielmo Marconi Italian international school moved to West Midtown in 2016.[138]  The New York Public Library (NYPL) operates the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building (also the Main Branch), a reference branch at 476 Fifth Avenue. The four-story building, constructed in 1911, is known worldwide for its architecture and has several million items in its collections.[139] There are also five circulating branches in Midtown:[140][141]  Two campuses of the City University of New York (CUNY)\u2014the doctorate-granting CUNY Graduate Center and the Stella and Charles Guttman Community College\u2014are located in Midtown, while Baruch College, also of the City University of New York, is located in Midtown South. Mercy College is situated at Herald Square.  Pennsylvania Station and Grand Central Terminal are the two major railroad stations located in Midtown Manhattan. Penn Station serves Amtrak, NJ Transit, and the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), while Grand Central serves the Metro-North Railroad and also serves the LIRR at Grand Central Madison.[149] Penn Station is considered to be the busiest transportation hub in the Western Hemisphere, servicing around 650,000 people per day.[150][151]  The Port Authority Bus Terminal, located at Eighth Avenue and 41st Street at the western edge of Midtown, is the city's main intercity bus terminal and the world's busiest bus station, serving 250,000 passengers on 7,000 buses each workday. The building opened in 1950 and had been designed to accommodate 60,000 daily passengers. A 2021 plan announced by the Port Authority would spend $10 billion to expand capacity and modernize the facility.[152][153][154]  The New York City Subway and MTA Regional Bus Operations each operate several routes that go through Midtown. Additionally, the PATH train to New Jersey terminates at 33rd Street and Sixth Avenue in Midtown.[155][156]  Traffic congestion is common, especially for crosstown traffic. In 2011, a new system of traffic light control, known as \"Midtown in Motion\" was announced, with the aim of reducing traffic congestion.[157] Approximately 750,000 vehicles enter Midtown Manhattan on a fall business day.[158] According to the 2011 Traffic Data Report for New York State, 777,527 vehicles a day went through select toll facilities into Manhattan.[159]  The New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department, is located at the Appellate Division Courthouse at 25th Street and Madison Avenue was completed in 1900 by architect James Brown Lord, who used a third of the construction budget to decorate the building with statues and murals.[160] The Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration operates its New York office on the 22nd floor at 135 West 50th Street.[161]  Several countries, including Algeria,[162] Argentina, The Bahamas,[163] China,[164] Costa Rica,[165] Germany,[166] Ireland,[167] Israel,[168] Jamaica,[169] Japan,[170] Luxembourg,[171] Mexico,[172] Morocco,[173] Saudi Arabia,[174] Singapore,[175] South Africa,[176] South Korea,[177] United Kingdom,[178] and Ukraine,[179] have Permanent Missions accredited to the United Nations, and consulates-general accredited to the United States, in Midtown Manhattan. In addition, the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office of the Republic of China (Taiwan) is in Midtown Manhattan.[180] "},{"title":"Defense (sports)","content":"  In many team sports, defense (American spelling) or defence (Commonwealth spelling) is the action of preventing an opponent from scoring. The term may also refer to the tactics involved in defense, or a sub-team whose primary responsibility is defense. Similarly, a defense player or defender is a player who is generally charged with preventing the other team's forwards from being able to bear down directly on their own team's goalkeeper or goaltender.  Such positions exist in association football, ice hockey, water polo and many other sports.  In bat-and-ball sports, the defending team is in the field, while the offensive team sends only a few players into the field to try to score at a time. These sports generally involve a member of the defense throwing the ball to a member of the offensive team, who then tries to hit it and run to various safe areas of the field to score points. Failing to hit the ball properly, or failing to reach the safe areas before the ball is used against the offensive player, can result in that player being left unable to score.  Baseball is unlike most other competitive sports in that the defense is given control of the ball. Additionally, the number of players on the field at any given time is lopsided in favor of the defense which always has nine players on the field; the offense has between one and four.  Historically, each player on the team had a role both on offense and defense. Most amateur and professional leagues have adopted the designated hitter (DH) rule introduced by the American League of Major League Baseball. In leagues that use the DH, pitchers usually do not bat, and the DH bats in lieu of the pitcher and does not play a defensive position. The main league that has not adopted the DH rule is the Central League of Nippon Professional Baseball.  Each play starts with the ball in the hands of the pitcher, whose job as a member of the defense is to use his skills to somehow prevent the batter from reaching base. The pitcher throws the ball toward the catcher, who must catch the pitched ball if it is not hit by the batter. In each half-inning, the defense attempts to force three outs.  There are three basic ways in which an out can occur:  If the batter manages to hit the ball, all nine defensive players become active and use the ball in attempting to prevent the batter from reaching base and runners already on base from advancing or scoring. while the offense is busy attempting to move runners around the baseball diamond toward home plate, the defense uses the ball in various ways to achieve outs.  If the defense forces three outs, their team is moved into the offensive role. The exception is if it is the ninth or an extra inning and they are ahead, in which case, the game ends and the defensive team wins.  In cricket, the fielding team is the defense, while the batting team is the offense; the batting team can only put two players on the field at a time.[1] By getting the batting team's batsmen out before they can hit the ball to the boundary or run between the two batsmen's grounds, the fielding team can prevent the batting team from scoring points. Players can be gotten out if they hit the ball in the air and it is caught by a defensive player before touching the ground, or if the ball hits a batsman's wicket, either when delivered by the bowler or when the batsman is not in his ground. By getting all but one of the batting team's players out, the fielding team ends their opponent's scoring turn, and may begin its own scoring turn next (though it can choose not to, in the case of the follow-on).  In water polo, if an offensive player, such as the center forward, has the ball in front of the goal, and the defender cannot steal the ball, he may intentionally commit a foul. The forward then has a free throw but must pass the ball off to another offensive player, rather than making a shot at the goal. Defensive perimeter players may also intentionally cause a foul and then move toward the goal, away from their attacker, who must take a free throw. This technique, called 'sloughing', allows the defense an opportunity to double-team the center forward and possibly steal the inbound pass. The water polo referee may refrain from declaring a foul caused by a defensive player, if in his judgment this would give the advantage to the defending team. This is known as the Advantage Rule.  There are four officially established ice skating team sports worldwide, excluding their variants. This group includes: bandy, ice hockey, ringette, and rinkball.  In ice hockey, there are normally two designated defencemen on the ice. A defence man can either be an offensive player better known for their ability to glean assists or goals rather than for their strong defensive play.  Such players are known as offensive defencemen.  The other is usually in a more defensive role and rarely show-up on the score sheet but are important for their defensive prowess; these players are known as stay-at-home defence. There are also defensemen who are good at both; known as two-way defensemen. Defense is a team game in hockey, and when the team is not in possession of the puck (also known as puck coverage), the aim is to effectively suppress the puck pressure coming from the opponents.  In bandy, the number of defenders on the ice at a given time depends on the format being played, either \"big ice\" bandy which has a type of field format, or rink bandy.  In ringette, there are two designated defenders on the ice in any normal game situation (the team is not serving any penalties). However, due to ringette's first-three-in rule these situations can vary; those playing in the defensive zone are not always designated defenders.  In rinkball, the number of defenders on the ice at a given time depends on the format being played.  There are three known organized skateless winter team sports worldwide, that are not organized forms of snowball fighting. This group includes: broomball, Spongee (a.k.a. \"sponge hockey\"), and Moscow broomball.  In broomball, the number of defenders on the ice at a given time depends on the format being played.  In spongee (a.k.a. \"sponge hockey\"), the number of defenders on the ice at a given time depends on the format being played.  In Moscow broomball, the number of defenders on the ice at a given time depends on the format being played.  In atya patya, the defenders aim to tag players on the offensive team in order to eliminate them and prevent them from scoring.[2]  In kabaddi, the defenders aim to avoid being touched by the opposing team's raider; if the defenders can tackle the raider or \"dash\" the raider out-of-bounds so that the raider cannot return to the other half of the field,[3] then the defenders score 1 point.[4]  In kho kho, the defenders aim to avoid being tagged. Defenders take to the field in batches of three, with tagged defenders eliminated from play, and a new batch entering the field once the entire previous batch has been dismissed.[5] "},{"title":"Endurance","content":"Endurance (also related to sufferance, forbearance, resilience, constitution, fortitude, persistence, tenacity, steadfastness, perseverance, stamina, and hardiness) is the ability of an organism to exert itself and remain active for a long period of time, as well as its ability to resist, withstand, recover from and have immunity to trauma, wounds, or fatigue.  The term is often used in the context of aerobic or anaerobic exercise. The definition of \"long\" varies according to the type of exertion \u2013 minutes for high intensity anaerobic exercise, hours or days for low intensity aerobic exercise. Training for endurance can reduce endurance strength[verification needed][1] unless an individual also undertakes resistance training to counteract this effect.  When a person is able to accomplish or withstand more effort than previously, their endurance is increasing. To improve their endurance they may slowly increase the amount of repetitions or time spent; in some exercises, more repetitions taken rapidly improve muscle strength but have less effect on endurance.[2] Increasing endurance has been proven to release endorphins resulting in a positive mind.[citation needed] The act of gaining endurance through physical activity decreases anxiety, depression, and stress, or any chronic disease[dubious  \u2013 discuss].[3] Although a greater endurance can assist the cardiovascular system this does not imply that endurance is guaranteed to improve any cardiovascular disease.[4] \"The major metabolic consequences of the adaptations of muscle to endurance exercise are a slower utilization of muscle glycogen and blood glucose, a greater reliance on fat oxidation, and less lactate production during exercise of a given intensity.\"[5]  The term stamina is sometimes used synonymously and interchangeably with endurance. Endurance may also refer to an ability to persevere through a difficult situation, to \"endure hardship\".  In military settings, endurance is the ability of a force[clarification needed] to sustain high levels of combat potential relative to its opponent over the duration of a campaign.[6]  Aristotle noted similarities between endurance and self control: To have self control is to resist the temptation of things that seem immediately appealing, while to endure is to resist the discouragement of things that seem immediately uncomfortable.[7]  Different types of endurance performance can be trained in specific ways. Adaptation of exercise plans should follow individual goals.  Calculating the intensity of exercise the individual capabilities should be considered[by whom?]. Effective training starts within half the individual performance capability.[further explanation needed] Performance capability is expressed by maximum heart rate. Best[clarification needed] results can be achieved in the range between 55% and 65% of maximum heart rate. Aerobic, anaerobic and further thresholds are not to be mentioned within extensive endurance exercises.[why?] Training intensity is measured via the heart rate.[8]  Between 2012 and 2019 at least 25 reports indicated a major role of epigenetic mechanisms in skeletal muscle responses to exercise.[9]  Gene expression in muscle is largely regulated, as in tissues generally, by regulatory DNA sequences, especially enhancers. Enhancers are non-coding sequences in the genome that activate the expression of distant target genes,[10] by looping around and interacting with the promoters of their target genes[11] (see Figure \"Regulation of transcription in mammals\"). As reported by Williams et al.,[12] the average distance in the loop between the connected enhancers and promoters of genes is 239,000 nucleotide bases.   After exercise, epigenetic alterations to enhancers alter long-term expression of hundreds of muscle genes. This includes genes producing proteins and other products secreted into the systemic circulation, many of which may act as endocrine messengers.[12] Of 817 genes with altered expression, 157 (according to Uniprot) or 392 (according to Exocarta) of the proteins produced according to those genes were known to be secreted from the muscles. Four days after an endurance type of exercise, many genes have persistently altered epigentically regulated expression.[12] Four pathways altered were in the platelet\/coagulation system, the cognitive system, the cardiovascular system, and the renal system. Epigenetic regulation of these genes was indicated by epigenetic alterations in the distant upstream DNA regulatory sequences of the enhancers of these genes.    Up-regulated genes had epigenetic acetylations added at histone 3 lysine 27 (H3k27ac) of nucleosomes located at the enhancers controlling those up-regulated genes, while down-regulated genes had epigenetic acetylations removed from H3K27 in nucleosomes located at the enhancers that control those genes (see Figure \"A nucleosome with histone tails set for transcriptional activation\"). Biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle showed expression of 13,108 genes at baseline before an exercise training program. Six sedentary 23-year-old Caucasian males provided vastus lateralis biopsies before entering an exercise program (six weeks of 60-minute sessions of riding a stationary cycle, five days per week). Four days after the exercise program was completed, biopsies of the same muscles had altered gene expression, with 641 genes up-regulated and 176 genes down-regulated. Williams et al.[12] identified 599 enhancer-gene interactions, covering 491 enhancers and 268 genes, where both the enhancer and the connected target gene were coordinately either upregulated or downregulated after exercise training.  Endurance muscle training also alters muscle gene expression through epigenetic DNA methylation or de-methylation of CpG sites within enhancers.[13]  In a study by Lindholm et al.,[13] twenty-three 27-year-old, sedentary, male and female volunteers had endurance training on only one leg during three months. The other leg was used as an untrained control leg. Skeletal muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis were taken both before training began and 24 hours after the last training session from each of the legs. The endurance-trained leg, compared to the untrained leg, had significant DNA methylation changes at 4,919 sites across the genome. The sites of altered DNA methylation were predominantly in enhancers. Transcriptional analysis, using RNA sequencing, identified 4,076 differentially expressed genes.      The transcriptionally upregulated genes were associated with enhancers that had a significant decrease in DNA methylation, while transcriptionally downregulated genes were associated with enhancers that had increased DNA methylation. In this study, the differentially methylated positions in enhancers with increased methylation were mainly associated with genes involved in structural remodeling of the muscle and glucose metabolism. The differentially decreased methylated positions in enhancers were associated with genes functioning in inflammatory\/immunological processes and transcriptional regulation. "},{"title":"Contact sport","content":"A contact sport is any sport where physical contact between competitors, or their environment, is an integral part of the game. For example, gridiron football. Contact may come about as the result of intentional or incidental actions by the players in the course of play. This is in contrast to noncontact sports where players often have no opportunity to make contact with each other and the laws of the game may expressly forbid contact. In contact sports some forms of contact are encouraged as a critical aspect of the game such as tackling, while others are incidental such as when shielding the ball or contesting an aerial challenge. As the types of contact between players is not equal between all sports they define the types of contact that is deemed acceptable and fall within the laws of the game, while outlawing other types of physical contact that might be considered expressly dangerous or risky such as a high tackle or spear tackle, or against the spirit of the game such as striking below the belt or other unsportsmanlike conduct. Where there is a limit as to how much contact is acceptable most sports have a mechanism to call a foul by the referee, umpire or similar official when an offence is deemed to have occurred.  Contact sports are categorised by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) into three main categories: contact, limited-contact and noncontact. In attempting to define relative risk for competitors in sports the AAP have further defined contact sports as containing some element of intentional collision between players.[1][2] They define such collision sports as being where: \"athletes purposely hit or collide with each other or with inanimate objects (including the ground) with great force\", while in limited-contact sports such impacts are often \"infrequent and inadvertent\".[1] While contact sports are considered the most high risk for injury, in some sports being a major feature (such as boxing or other martial arts), limited-contact and noncontact sports are not without risk as injury or contact may come about as a result of a fall or collision with the playing area, or a piece of sporting equipment, such as being struck by a hockey stick or football or even a piece of protective wear worn by a teammate or opposition player.  Some definitions of contact sports, particularly martial arts, have the concept of full contact, semi-contact and noncontact (or other definitions) for both training and competitive sparring. Some categories of contact may or may not be combined with other methods of scoring, but full contact is generally considered to include the potential for victory by knockout or submission depending on the form of combat.[3][4][5] An example of this is full contact karate and taekwondo where competitors are allowed to attempt to knock out an opponent through strikes to the head or otherwise bringing the opponent to the floor.[6][7] Full contact rules differentiate from other forms of the same sports that may otherwise restrict blows to the head and the use of elbows or knees.[5] Such full contact sports may be defined as combat sports and require a of change equipment, alter or omit rules, and are generally differentiated from contact sports by their explicit intent of defeating an opponent in physical combat.[8][3][5]  Some contact sports have limited-contact or noncontact variations (such as flag football for American football) which attempt to replace tackling and other forms of contact with alternative methods of interacting with an opponent, such as removing a flag from a belt worn by the opponent or outlawing specific actions entirely such as in walking football.[9]  Current medical terminology in the United States uses the term contact sport and collision sport to refer to sports like rugby, American football, ice hockey, lacrosse and roller derby. The term limited-contact sport is used to refer to sports such as soccer, baseball and handball, and the term noncontact sport to sports like badminton, running and swimming.[2]  The American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement was revised in 2008 to include the following definition:  In collision sports (e.g. boxing, ice hockey, American football, lacrosse, and rodeo), athletes purposely hit or collide with each other or with inanimate objects (including the ground) with great force. In contact sports (e.g. basketball), athletes routinely make contact with each other or with inanimate objects but usually with less force than in collision sports. In limited-contact sports (e.g. softball and squash), contact with other athletes or with inanimate objects is infrequent or inadvertent.[2] A full contact sport is primarily any combat sport that allows the competitor to attempt to knock-out or otherwise defeat their opponent by physically incapacitating them. Examples of this would include most professional martial arts such as Mixed Martial Arts, Boxing and some forms of Karate and Taekwondo. Defeating an opponent generally takes place using in isolation or combination actions such as striking and grappling depending on the rules of the sport.[citation needed]  Full-contact martial arts include:  A semi-contact sport is typically a combat sport involving striking and containing physical contact between the combatants simulating full-power techniques. The techniques are restricted to limited power, and rendering the opponent unconscious is forbidden. Some semi-contact sports use a point system to determine the winner and use extensive protective gear to protect the athletes from injury. Examples of semi-contact sports include karate, kickboxing, kalaripayattu, Kenpo, various Korean martial arts that incorporate contact rules sparring, kendo, some types of historical European martial arts, fencing and taekwondo.[citation needed]  As defined by the AAP, and also considered collision sports.[2] The AAP notes Martial arts can be subclassified as judo, jujitsu, karate, kung fu, and tae kwon do; some forms are contact sports and others are limited-contact sports.  As defined by the AAP.[2] The AAP notes Martial arts can be subclassified as judo, jujitsu, karate, kung fu, and tae kwon do; some forms are contact sports and others are limited-contact sports.  As defined by the AAP.[2]  As a result of the risk of injury, some sports require the use of protective equipment, for example American football protective equipment or the gloves and helmets needed for underwater hockey. Some sports are also played on soft ground and have padding on physical obstacles, such as goal posts.  Most contact sports require any male players to wear a protective cup to protect their genitalia.  There has been an increasing medical, academic, and media focus on sports involving rapid contact in the late 20th to early 21st century and their relationship with sports injuries. Several sports' governing bodies began changing their rules in order to decrease the incidence of serious injuries and avoid lawsuits. In some countries, new laws have been passed, particularly in regard to concussions.  At the professional level, America's professional football league, the National Football League, implemented The Concussion Protocol in 2011, banning concussed players from re-entering the same game in which they were injured in order to reduce the risk of further injury and damage.[10]  In Canada in 2018, Rowan's Law was passed after the death of a young Canadian female athlete. Rowan Stringer died in 2013 of second-impact syndrome, \"...the result of suffering multiple concussions playing rugby three times in six days.\"[11] "},{"title":"Irish Sea","content":"  The Irish Sea[a] is a 46,007\u00a0km2 (17,763\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) body of water that separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is linked to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland[4] in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey, North Wales, is the largest island in the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The term Manx Sea may occasionally be encountered (Welsh: M\u00f4r Manaw, Irish: Muir Meann[5] Manx: Mooir Vannin, Scottish Gaelic: Muir Mhanainn).[6][7][8]  On its shoreline are Scotland to the north, England to the east, Wales to the southeast, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to the west. The Irish Sea is of significant economic importance to regional trade, shipping and transport, as well as fishing and power generation in the form of wind power and nuclear power plants. Annual traffic between Great Britain and Ireland amounts to over 12 million passengers and 17\u00a0million tonnes (17,000,000 long tons; 19,000,000 short tons) of traded goods.  The Irish Sea joins the North Atlantic at both its northern and southern ends. To the north, the connection is through the North Channel between Scotland and Northern Ireland and the Malin Sea. The southern end is linked to the Atlantic through the St George's Channel between Ireland and Pembrokeshire, and the Celtic Sea. It is composed of a deeper channel about 300\u00a0km (190\u00a0mi) long and 30\u201350\u00a0km (20\u201330\u00a0mi) wide on its western side and shallower bays to the east. The depth of the western channel ranges from 80 metres (260\u00a0ft) to 275\u00a0m (900\u00a0ft).  Cardigan Bay in the south, and the waters to the east of the Isle of Man, are less than 50\u00a0m (160\u00a0ft) deep. With a total water volume of 2,430\u00a0km3 (580\u00a0cu\u00a0mi) and a surface area of 47,000\u00a0km2 (18,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), 80% is to the west of the Isle of Man. The largest sandbanks are the Bahama and King William Banks to the east and north of the Isle of Man and the Kish Bank, Codling Bank, Arklow Bank and Blackwater Bank near the coast of Ireland. The Irish Sea, at its greatest width, is 200\u00a0km (120\u00a0mi) and narrows to 75\u00a0km (47\u00a0mi).[9]  The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Irish Sea (with St George's Channel) as follows,  The Irish Sea has undergone a series of dramatic changes over the last 20,000 years as the last glacial period ended and was replaced by warmer conditions. At the height of the glaciation, the central part of the modern sea was probably a long freshwater lake. As the ice retreated 10,000 years ago, the lake reconnected to the sea.  The Irish Sea was formed in the Neogene era.[10] Notable crossings include several invasions from Britain. The Norman invasion of Ireland took place in stages during the late 12th century from Porthclais near St. Davids, Wales, in Hulks, Snekkars, Keels and Cogs[11] to Wexford Harbour, Leinster.[12] The Tudors crossed the Irish Sea to invade in 1529 in caravels and carracks.[11] In 1690 the English fleet set sail for the Williamite War in Ireland from Hoylake, Wirral, the departure becoming permanently known as King's Gap as a result.[citation needed]  Because Ireland has neither tunnel nor bridge to connect it with Great Britain, the vast majority of heavy goods trade is done by sea. Northern Ireland ports handle 10\u00a0million tonnes (9,800,000 long tons; 11,000,000 short tons) of goods trade with the rest of the United Kingdom annually; the ports in the Republic of Ireland handle 7.6\u00a0million tonnes (7,500,000 long tons; 8,400,000 short tons), representing 50% and 40% respectively of total trade by weight.  The Port of Liverpool handles 32\u00a0million tonnes (31,000,000 long tons; 35,000,000 short tons) of cargo and 734,000 passengers a year.[13] Holyhead port handles most of the passenger traffic from Dublin and D\u00fan Laoghaire ports, as well as 3.3\u00a0million tonnes (3,200,000 long tons; 3,600,000 short tons) of freight.[14]  Ports in the Republic handle 3,600,000 travellers crossing the sea each year, amounting to 92% of all Irish Sea travel.[15]  Ferry connections from Wales to Ireland across the Irish Sea include Fishguard Harbour and Pembroke to Rosslare, Holyhead to D\u00fan Laoghaire and Holyhead to Dublin. From Scotland, Cairnryan connects with both Belfast and Larne. There is also a connection between Liverpool and Belfast via the Isle of Man or direct from Birkenhead. The world's largest car ferry, Ulysses, is operated by Irish Ferries on the Dublin Port\u2013Holyhead route; Stena Line also operates between Britain and Ireland.  \"Irish Sea\" is also the name of one of the BBC's Shipping Forecast areas defined by the coordinates:  Transport for Wales Rail, Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann, Irish Ferries, Stena Line, Northern Ireland Railways, Stena Line and ScotRail promote SailRail with through rail tickets for the train and the ferry.[16]  The British ship LCT 326 sank in the Irish sea and was discovered in March 2020. In September 2021, the British Navy ship HMS Mercury was discovered; it sank in 1940. The British ship SS Mesaba was sunk by the Imperial German Navy U-118 in 1918 and discovered in 2022. [17] This ship is well known for sailing near the Titanic and for attempting to warn the Titanic about dangerous icebergs.  The Caernarfon Bay basin contains up to 7 cubic kilometres (1.7\u00a0cu\u00a0mi) of Permian and Triassic syn-rift sediments in an asymmetrical graben that is bounded to the north and south by Lower Paleozoic massifs.[18] Only two exploration wells have been drilled so far, and there remain numerous undrilled targets in tilted fault block plays.[19] As in the East Irish Sea Basin, the principal target reservoir is the Lower Triassic, Sherwood Sandstone, top-sealed by younger Triassic mudstones and evaporites. Wells in the Irish Sector to the west have demonstrated that pre-rift, Westphalian coal measures are excellent hydrocarbon source rocks, and are at peak maturity for gas generation (Maddox et al., 1995). Seismic profiles clearly image these strata continuing beneath a basal Permian unconformity into at least the western part of the Caernarfon Bay Basin.  The timing of gas generation presents the greatest exploration risk. Maximum burial of, and primary gas migration from, the source rocks could have terminated as early as the Jurassic, whereas many of the tilted fault blocks were reactivated or created during Paleogene inversion of the basin. However, it is also possible that a secondary gas charge occurred during regional heating associated with intrusion of Paleogene dykes, such as those that crop out nearby on the coastline of north Wales. (Floodpage et al., 1999) have invoked this second phase of Paleogene hydrocarbon generation as an important factor in the charging of the East Irish Sea Basin's oil and gas fields. It is not clear as yet whether aeromagnetic anomalies in the southeast of Caernarfon Bay are imaging a continuation of the dyke swarm into this area too, or whether they are instead associated with deeply buried Permian syn-rift volcanics. Alternatively, the fault block traps could have been recharged by exsolution of methane from formation brines as a direct result of the Tertiary uplift (cf. Dor\u00e9 and Jensen, 1996).  The Cardigan Bay Basin forms a continuation into British waters of Ireland's North Celtic Sea Basin, which has two producing gas fields. The basin comprises a south-easterly deepening half-graben near the Welsh coastline, although its internal structure becomes increasingly complex towards the southwest. Permian to Triassic, syn-rift sediments within the basin are less than 3\u00a0km (1.9\u00a0mi) thick and are overlain by up to 4\u00a0km (2.5\u00a0mi) of Jurassic strata, and locally also by up to 2\u00a0km (1.2\u00a0mi) of Paleogene fluvio-deltaic sediments. The basin has a proven petroleum system, with potentially producible gas reserves at the Dragon discovery near the UK\/ROI median line, and oil shows in a further three wells. The Cardigan Bay Basin contains multiple reservoir targets, which include the Lower Triassic (Sherwood Sandstone), Middle Jurassic shallow marine sandstones and limestone (Great Oolite), and Upper Jurassic fluvial sandstone, the reservoir for the Dragon discovery.  The most likely hydrocarbon source rocks are Early Jurassic marine mudstones. These are fully mature for oil generation in the west of the British sector and are mature for gas generation nearby in the Irish sector. Gas-prone, Westphalian pre-rift coal measures may also be present at depth locally. The Cardigan Bay Basin was subjected to two Tertiary phases of compressive uplift, whereas maximum burial that terminated primary hydrocarbon generation was probably around the end of the Cretaceous, or earlier if Cretaceous strata, now missing, were never deposited in the basin. Despite the Tertiary structuration, the Dragon discovery has proved that potentially commercial volumes of hydrocarbons were retained at least locally in Cardigan Bay. In addition to undrilled structural traps, the basin contains the untested potential for stratigraphic entrapment of hydrocarbons near synsedimentary faults, especially in the Middle Jurassic section.[19][20]  The Liverpool Bay Development is BHP Billiton Petroleum's largest operated asset. It comprises the integrated development of five offshore oil and gas fields in the Irish Sea:  Oil is produced from the Lennox and Douglas fields. It is then treated at the Douglas Complex and piped 17\u00a0km (11\u00a0mi) to an oil storage barge ready for export by tankers. Gas is produced from the Hamilton, Hamilton North and Hamilton East reservoirs. After initial processing at the Douglas Complex the gas is piped by subsea pipeline to the Point of Ayr gas terminal for further processing. The gas is then sent by onshore pipeline to PowerGen's combined cycle gas turbine power station at Connah's Quay. PowerGen is the sole purchaser of gas from the Liverpool Bay development.  The Liverpool Bay development comprises four offshore platforms. Offshore storage and loading facilities. The onshore gas processing terminal at Point of Ayr. Production first started at each field as follows: Hamilton North in 1995, Hamilton in 1996, Douglas in 1996, Lennox (oil only) in 1996 and Hamilton East 2001. The first contract gas sales were in 1996.  The quality of the water in Liverpool Bay was historically contaminated by dumping of sewage sludge at sea[21] but this practice became illegal in December 1988 and no further sludge was deposited after that date.[22]  With 210\u00a0billion cubic metres (7.5\u00a0trillion cubic feet) of natural gas and 176\u00a0million barrels (28,000,000\u00a0m3) of petroleum estimated by the field operators as initially recoverable hydrocarbon reserves from eight producing fields (DTI, 2001), the East Irish Sea Basin is at a mature exploration phase. Early Namurian basinal mudstones are the source rocks for these hydrocarbons. Production from all fields is from fault-bounded traps of the Lower Triassic formation, principally the aeolian Sherwood Sandstone reservoir, top-sealed by younger Triassic continental mudstones and evaporites. Future mineral exploration will initially concentrate on extending this play, but there remains largely untested potential also for gas and oil within widespread Carboniferous fluvial sandstone reservoirs. This play requires intraformational mudstone seal units to be present, as there is no top-seal for reservoirs sub cropping the regional base Permian unconformity in the east of the basin, and Carboniferous strata crop out at the sea bed in the west.  Previous exploration drilling in the Kish Bank Basin has confirmed the potential for petroleum generation with oil shows seen in a number of wells together with natural hydrocarbon seeps recorded from airborne surveys. New[when?] analysis of vintage 2-D seismic data has revealed the presence of a large undrilled structural closure at Lower Triassic level situated about 10 kilometres (6\u00a0mi) offshore Dublin. This feature, known as the Dalkey Island exploration prospect, may be prospective for oil, as there are prolific oil productive Lower Triassic reservoirs nearby in the eastern Irish Sea offshore Liverpool. Whilst the Dalkey Island exploration prospect could contain about 870\u00a0million barrels (140,000,000\u00a0m3) of oil in place, this undrilled prospect still has significant risk and the partners are currently advancing a focused work programme in order to better understand and hopefully mitigate these risks. However, given its location in shallow water and close proximity to shore, the prospect is of great interest as exploration drilling, together with any future development costs, are likely to be low.[citation needed]  Below is a list of cities and towns around the Irish Sea coasts in order of size:  The most accessible and possibly the greatest wildlife resource of the Irish Sea lies in its estuaries: particularly the Dee Estuary, the Mersey Estuary, the Ribble Estuary, Morecambe Bay, the Solway Firth, the Firth of Clyde, Belfast Lough, Strangford Lough, Carlingford Lough, Dundalk Bay, Dublin Bay and Wexford Harbour. However, a lot of wildlife also depends on the cliffs, salt marshes and sand dunes of the adjoining shores, the seabed and the open sea itself.  The information on the invertebrates of the seabed of the Irish Sea is rather patchy because it is difficult to survey such a large area, where underwater visibility is often poor and information often depends upon looking at material brought up from the seabed in mechanical grabs. However, the groupings of animals present depend to a large extent on whether the seabed is composed of rock, boulders, gravel, sand, mud or even peat. In the soft sediments seven types of community have been provisionally identified, variously dominated by brittle-stars, sea urchins, worms, mussels, tellins, furrow-shells, and tower-shells.  Parts of the bed of the Irish Sea are very rich in wildlife. The seabed southwest of the Isle of Man is particularly noted for its rarities and diversity,[26] as are the horse mussel beds of Strangford Lough. Scallops and queen scallops are found in more gravelly areas. In the estuaries, where the bed is more sandy or muddy, the number of species is smaller but the size of their populations is larger. Brown shrimp, cockles and edible mussels support local fisheries in Morecambe Bay and the Dee Estuary and the estuaries are also important as nurseries for flatfish, herring and sea bass. Muddy seabeds in deeper waters are home to populations of the Dublin Bay prawn, also known as \"scampi\".[27]  The open sea is a complex habitat in its own right. It exists in three spatial dimensions and also varies over time and tide. For example, where freshwater flows into the Irish Sea in river estuaries its influence can extend far offshore as the freshwater is lighter and \"floats\" on top of the much larger body of salt water until wind and temperature changes mix it in. Similarly, warmer water is less dense and seawater warmed in the inter-tidal zone may \"float\" on the colder offshore water. The amount of light penetrating the seawater also varies with depth and turbidity. This leads to differing populations of plankton in different parts of the sea and varying communities of animals that feed on these populations. However, increasing seasonal storminess leads to greater mixing of water and tends to break down these divisions, which are more apparent when the weather is calm for long periods.  Plankton includes bacteria, plants (phytoplankton) and animals (zooplankton) that drift in the sea. Most are microscopic, but some, such as the various species of jellyfish and sea gooseberry, can be much bigger.  Diatoms and dinoflagellates dominate the phytoplankton. Although they are microscopic plants, diatoms have hard shells and dinoflagellates have little tails that propel them through the water. Phytoplankton populations in the Irish Sea have a spring \"bloom\" every April and May, when the seawater is generally at its greenest.  Crustaceans, especially copepods, dominate the zooplankton. However, many animals of the seabed, the open sea and the seashore spend their juvenile stages as part of the zooplankton. The whole plankton \"soup\" is vitally important, directly or indirectly, as a food source for most species in the Irish Sea, even the largest. The enormous basking shark, for example, lives entirely on plankton and the leatherback turtle's main food is jellyfish.  A colossal diversity of invertebrate species live in the Irish Sea and its surrounding coastline, ranging from flower-like fan-worms to predatory swimming crabs to large chameleon-like cuttlefish.[27] Some of the most significant for other wildlife are the reef-building species like the inshore horse mussel of Strangford Lough, the inter-tidal honeycomb worm of Morecambe Bay, Cumbria and Lancashire, and the sub-tidal honeycomb worm of the Wicklow Reef. These build up large structures over many years and, in turn, provide surfaces, nooks and crannies where other marine animals and plants may become established and live out some or all of their lives.  There are quite regular records of live and stranded leatherback turtles in and around the Irish Sea. This species travels north to the waters off the British Isles every year following the swarms of jellyfish that form its prey. Loggerhead turtle, ridley sea turtle and green turtle are found very occasionally in the Irish Sea but are generally unwell or dead when discovered. They have strayed or been swept out of their natural range further south into colder waters.[28][29]  The estuaries of the Irish Sea are of international importance for birds. They are vital feeding grounds on migration flyways for shorebirds travelling between the Arctic and Africa. Others depend on the milder climate as a refuge when continental Europe is in the grip of winter.[27]  Twenty-one species of seabird are reported as regularly nesting on beaches or cliffs around the Irish Sea. Huge populations of the sea duck, common scoter, spend winters feeding in shallow waters off eastern Ireland, Lancashire and North Wales.[27]  Whales, dolphins and porpoises all frequent the Irish Sea, but knowledge of how many there may be and where they go is somewhat sketchy. About a dozen species have been recorded since 1980, but only three are seen fairly often. These are the harbour porpoise, bottlenose dolphin and common dolphin. The more rarely seen species are minke whale, fin whale, sei whale, humpback whale, North Atlantic right whales[30] which are now considered to be almost extinct in eastern North Atlantic, sperm whale, northern bottlenose whale, long-finned pilot whale, orca, white-beaked dolphin, striped dolphin and Risso's dolphin.[27] In 2005, a plan to reintroduce grey whales by airlifting 50 of them from the Pacific Ocean to the Irish Sea was claimed to be logically and ethically feasible;[31] it has not been implemented as of 2013.  The common or harbour seal and the grey seal are both resident in the Irish Sea. Common seals breed in Strangford Lough, grey seals in southwest Wales and, in small numbers, on the Isle of Man. Grey seals haul out, but do not breed, off Hilbre and Walney islands, Merseyside, the Wirral, St Annes, Barrow-in-Furness Borough, and Cumbria.[27]  The Irish Sea has been described by Greenpeace as the most radioactively contaminated sea in the world with some \"eight million litres of nuclear waste\" discharged into it each day from Sellafield reprocessing plants, contaminating seawater, sediments and marine life.[32]  Low-level radioactive waste has been discharged into the Irish Sea as part of operations at Sellafield since 1952. The rate of discharge began to accelerate in the mid- to late 1960s, reaching a peak in the 1970s and generally declining significantly since then. As an example of this profile, discharges of plutonium (specifically 241Pu) peaked in 1973 at 2,755 terabecquerels (74,500\u00a0Ci)[33] falling to 8.1\u00a0TBq (220\u00a0Ci) by 2004.[34] Improvements in the treatment of waste in 1985 and 1994 resulted in further reductions in radioactive waste discharge although the subsequent processing of a backlog resulted in increased discharges of certain types of radioactive waste. Discharges of technetium in particular rose from 6.1\u00a0TBq (160\u00a0Ci) in 1993 to a peak of 192\u00a0TBq (5,200\u00a0Ci) in 1995 before dropping back to 14\u00a0TBq (380\u00a0Ci) in 2004.[33][34] In total 22 petabecquerels (590\u00a0kCi) of 241Pu was discharged over the period 1952 to 1998.[35] Current rates of discharge for many radionuclides are at least 100 times lower than they were in the 1970s.[36]  Analysis[37][38] of the distribution of radioactive contamination after discharge reveals that mean sea currents result in much of the more soluble elements such as caesium being flushed out of the Irish Sea through the North Channel about a year after discharge. Measurements of technetium concentrations post-1994 has produced estimated transit times to the North Channel of around six months with peak concentrations off the northeast Irish coast occurring 18\u201324 months after peak discharge. Less soluble elements such as plutonium are subject to much slower redistribution. Whilst concentrations have declined in line with the reduction in discharges they are markedly higher in the eastern Irish Sea compared to the western areas. The dispersal of these elements is closely associated with sediment activity, with muddy deposits on the seabed acting as sinks, soaking up an estimated 200\u00a0kg (440\u00a0lb) of plutonium.[39] The highest concentration is found in the eastern Irish Sea in sediment banks lying parallel to the Cumbrian coast. This area acts as a significant source of wider contamination as radionuclides are dissolved once again. Studies have revealed that 80% of current seawater contamination by caesium is sourced from sediment banks, whilst plutonium levels in the western sediment banks between the Isle of Man and the Irish coast are being maintained by contamination redistributed from the eastern sediment banks.  The consumption of seafood harvested from the Irish Sea is the main pathway for exposure of humans to radioactivity.[40] The environmental monitoring report for the period 2003 to 2005 published by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) reported that in 2005 average quantities of radioactive contamination found in seafood ranged from less than 1\u00a0Bq\/kg (12\u00a0pCi\/lb) for fish to under 44\u00a0Bq\/kg (540\u00a0pCi\/lb) for mussels.[41] Doses of man-made radioactivity received by the heaviest consumers of seafood in Ireland in 2005 was 1.10\u00a0\u03bcSv (0.000110\u00a0rem).[42] This compares with a corresponding dosage of radioactivity naturally occurring in the seafood consumed by this group of 148\u00a0\u03bcSv (0.0148\u00a0rem) and a total average dosage in Ireland from all sources of 3,620\u00a0\u03bcSv (0.362\u00a0rem).[43] In terms of risk to this group, heavy consumption of seafood generates a 1 in 18 million chance of causing cancer. The general risk of contracting cancer in Ireland is 1 in 522. In the UK, the heaviest seafood consumers in Cumbria received a radioactive dosage attributable to Sellafield discharges of 220\u00a0\u03bcSv (0.022\u00a0rem) in 2005.[44] This compares to average annual dose of naturally sourced radiation received in the UK of 2,230\u00a0\u03bcSv (0.223\u00a0rem).[45]  Discussions of linking Britain to Ireland began in 1895,[46] with an application for \u00a315,000 towards the cost of carrying out borings and soundings in the North Channel to see if a tunnel between Ireland and Scotland was viable. Sixty years later, Harford Montgomery Hyde, Unionist MP for North Belfast, called for the building of such a tunnel.[47] A tunnel project has been discussed several times in the Irish parliament.[48][49][50][51] The idea for a 34-kilometre (21\u00a0mi) long rail bridge or tunnel continues to be mooted. Several potential projects have been proposed, including one between Dublin and Holyhead put forward in 1997 by the British engineering firm Symonds. At 80\u00a0km (50\u00a0mi), it would have been by far the longest rail tunnel on earth with an estimated cost approaching \u00a320 billion.[52]  An offshore wind farm was developed on the Arklow Bank,[53] Arklow Bank Wind Park, about 10\u00a0km (6.2\u00a0mi) off the coast of County Wicklow in the south Irish Sea. The site currently has seven GE 3.6\u00a0MW turbines, each with 104-metre (341\u00a0ft) diameter rotors, the world's first commercial application of offshore wind turbines over three megawatts in size. The operating company, Airtricity, has indefinite plans for nearly 100 further turbines on the site.   Further wind turbine sites include: "},{"title":"Three points for a win","content":"  Three points for a win is a standard used in many sports leagues and group tournaments, especially in association football, in which three points are awarded to the team winning a match, with no points awarded to the losing team.  If the game is drawn, each team receives one point.  Many leagues and competitions originally awarded two points for a win and one point for a draw, before switching to the three points for a win system. The change is significant in league tables, where teams typically play 30\u201340 games per season.  The system places additional value on wins compared to draws so that teams with a higher number of wins may rank higher in tables than teams with a lower number of wins but more draws.[1]  \"Three points for a win\" is supposed to encourage more attacking play than \"two points for a win\", as teams will not settle for a draw if the prospect of gaining two extra points (by playing for a late winning goal) outweighs the prospect of losing one point by conceding a late goal to lose the match. A second rationale is that it may prevent collusion amongst teams needing only a draw to advance in a tournament or avoid relegation. A commentator has stated that it has resulted in more \"positive, attacking play\".[2] However, critics suggest teams with a one-goal lead late in a match become more defensive in order to defend a lead.[3][4][failed verification] In addition, the overall competitive balance decreases in favour of top teams.[5] The average number of goals per match in Turkey's top football division has risen significantly since the change to three points for a win.[6]  The three-point system in ice hockey \u2013 in the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Russia, Switzerland and Sweden \u2013 had no effect on the number of goals scored. The same conclusion can be made for relative number of ties.[7]  Changing the scoring system may (or may not) change how a game is played, and it may change the results in a tournament even if there is no change in the way the game is played. One key outcome is when an overall result is different under three points for a win (W3) compared to what it would have been under two points for a win (W2).  For a four team round robin, under two points for a win (W2) there are 16 possible combinations of final standings points eg. 6-4-2-0 with each team potentially able to score up to 6 points. Under three points for a win (W3) there are 40 combinations eg. 9-6-3-0 with each team being able to score from zero up to 9 points (with 8 the only score that cannot be scored).[8]  Just four of the 40 W3 combinations yield potentially different placings if the scoring system was W2. These are listed below (considered for the case of association football (soccer) where goal difference is the next criteria for splitting points ties):[9]  There are two instances in FIFA World Cups where the result under 3 points for a win would have or could have been changed from the hypothetical outcome that would have occurred under 2 points for a win.  The first was when Slovakia finished W3 2nd in Group F of the 2010 FIFA Men's World Cup. The Group F W3 standings were 5-4-3-2 which would be 4-3-3-2 under W2. New Zealand finished W3 3rd with three draws (and so, a goal difference = 0). Slovakia had 1 draw, 1 loss and 1 win (the win over 5th-ranked Italy causing Italy's early World Cup exit). But Slovakia's goal difference was -1. Therefore New Zealand would have advanced to the Round of 16 hypothetically under W2 and so would have had their most successful World Cup (they have never advanced from the group stage). Instead, under W3, Slovakia advanced, losing to Netherlands 1-2 in the Round of 16.  The second of only two instances of the W3\/W2 difference potentially affecting who progressed in a World Cup final tournament occurred in Group D of the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup. Group D finished W3 7-4-3-1 which would have been 5-3-3-1 under W2. The Matildas (Australia's women's soccer team) finished W3 2nd with a goal difference = 0, Sweden W3 3rd also with a goal difference = 0. Both teams had 4 goals each, and drew when they played each other. To break the hypothetical W2 tie, drawing lots would have been instigated ('fair play points' as a tie-breaker had not begun).    That hypothetical drawing of lots would not have stopped the loser advancing, as the W2 3rd would still have advanced as 3rd best W2 3rd place getter (Sweden actually progressed as 4th best W3 3rd) but it would have changed which branch of the knockout round they were placed in.  Under W3, in the knockout rounds W3 2nd the Matildas played 7th-ranked Brazil and won 1-0, then lost to Japan 0-1 in their QF, while W3 3rd Sweden met top-ranked Germany losing 1-4 in the Round of 16. So the Matildas benefited from playing under W3 rather than W2 while Sweden suffered - as a hypothetical drawing lots loss under W2 would have likely resulted in a less successful World Cup for the Matildas up against top-ranked Germany in the hypothetical W2 Round of 16.  The system was proposed for the English Football League (then known as The Football League) by Jimmy Hill.[10] It was introduced in England in 1981,[3] but did not attract much use elsewhere until it was used in the 1994 World Cup finals. In 1995, FIFA formally adopted the system,[3] and it subsequently became standard in international tournaments, as well as most national football leagues. In the mid to late 1990s Legues and governing bodies in the of sports ice hockey, field hockey, Volleyball, Water Polo, Bandy, Floorball, Camogie, Gaelic football would start adopting the 3 points for a win system. Variations on the original 3 points for a win, 1 point for a tie, 0 zero points for a loss were invented. For example in ice hockey where overtime\/shootouts are used determine the winner for every game in at the end of Regulation teams earn 3 points for a win, 1 point for a tie, 0 zero points for a loss, the winner overtime\/shootouts earn an additional point for total two earn in the game. This means once a winner is decided the point system is 3 points for a regulation win, 2 points overtime\/shootout win, 1 point for a overtime\/shootout loss, 0 zero points for a regulation loss.   This lists association football leagues where the standard is 3 points for a win in regulation time, one point for a draw, zero for a defeat. The year given is when the relevant season started.  Major League Soccer, based in the United States and Canada, has awarded three points for a win since its first season of 1996, but initially held a penalty shootout at the end of regulation draws, awarding 1 point to the winner of the shootout and none to the loser. Since 2000, it has allowed ties\/draws to stand in the regular season, and follows the international standard of awarding 1 point for a draw.[21][failed verification]. Since 2023 The Leagues Cup between MLS and Liga MX uses 3 points for a regulation win, 2 point for a shootout win, 1 points for a shootout loss, 0 for a regulation loss point system in the group stage.  Many ice hockey leagues use the 3 points for a regulation win, 2 points for an overtime\/shootout win, 1 point for overtime\/shootout loss, 0 points for a regulation loss as a way to incentivize teams to win in regulation thus causing more attacking play. Listed below are the years that ice hockey leagues and associations have adopted and abandoned a 3 point for a win system.  The Russian Bandy Super League Started using 3 point for a win, 1 point for a tie, 0 for a loss point system for the Preliminary round in 1995. In 1996  the 3 point for a win, 1 point for a tie, 0 for a loss point system was adopted for all rounds.  Since 1998 FIH has used the 3 point for a win, 1 point for a tie, 0 for a loss point system.[47]  The FINA Water Polo World League used the 3 points for a regulation win,1 point for tie, 0 points for a regulation loss point system in 2003 and 3 points for a regulation win, 2 points for a Shootout win, 1 point for Shootout loss, 0 points for a regulation loss point system from 2004 to 2022.In 2023 FINA Water Polo World League was ended and both the men's and women's World cup adopted the 3 points for a regulation win, 2 points for a Shootout win, 1 point for Shootout loss, 0 points for a regulation loss point system. At The 2024 Summer Olympics tournament will use the 3 points for a regulation win, 2 points for a Shootout win, 1 point for Shootout loss, 0 points for a regulation loss point system.  The All-Ireland Senior Camogie Championship adopted 3 point for a win, 1 point for a tie, 0 for a loss point system in 2016.  Since 2020 The Ladies' Gaelic Football Association currently uses the 3 point for a win, 1 point for a tie, 0 for a loss point system for all competitions.  In FIVB Summer Olympics & World Championship adopted the match point system of 3 points for winning in three or four sets, 2 points for winning in five sets, 1 point for losing in five sets, 0 points for losing in three or four sets in 2011.Since 2016 matches won has been the primary ranking method with the match point system being first tiebreaker.  In 1936 there kicked off the first USSR Championship in football among \"exhibition teams\" (later \"teams of masters\") instead of cities teams as previously and was conducted as a league's round-robin tournament. The points in tournament were awarded in a format three points for a win, but for a draw was awarded two points and a loss \u2013 one point, while no points were awarded for no show.  Some leagues have used shootout tiebreakers after drawn matches. Major League Soccer (1996\u20132000) used three points for a win, one point for a shootout win, no points for a loss in any fashion (including shootouts).[21][failed verification] The Norwegian First Division (in 1987) and the Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A and its lower divisions (in 1988) used three points for a win, two points for a shootout win, one point for a shootout loss, none for a loss.[50][51] The same system is adopted in the group stages of the 2016\u201317 EFL Trophy and 2016\u201317 Scottish League Cup onward (in both cases, no extra time will be played). The Iraqi Premier League has used two different variants of this system. The first was in the 1988\u201389 season, where three points were awarded for a win by two or more goals (after normal or extra time), two points were awarded for a one-goal win (after normal or extra time), one point was awarded for a penalty shootout win and zero points were awarded for penalty shootout defeats or defeats after normal or extra time.[52] The second variant was used in the 1994\u201395 season, where three points were awarded for a one-goal or two-goal win, but four points were awarded for a win by three or more goals.[53]  In the National Hockey League in North America, a system described as \"the three point win\" was proposed in 2004, with three points for a win in regulation time, two for a win in overtime, and one for a tie. This proposal was put on hold by the 2004\u201305 NHL lock-out and subsequently rejected by team owners in February 2007.[54] Instead the NHL awards two points for a win in regulation or overtime\/shootout, one point for an overtime or shootout loss, and none for a regulation loss.  International competitions run by the International Ice Hockey Federation award three points for a win in regulation time and zero points for a loss.  Games in IIHF competitions are not allowed to end in ties; if a game is tied after regulation each team is awarded one point and a sudden-death overtime followed by a shootout (if necessary) is played, with the winner awarded an extra point (for a total of two points).[55]  In 2009, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association adopted a system of three points for a regulation or overtime win, two for a shootout win, one for a shootout loss, and none for a regulation or overtime loss.[56]  The IIHF uses a similar system for its competitions, awarding three points for a win in regulation, two points for a win in overtime or shootout, one point for a loss in overtime or shootout, and no points for a loss in regulation.[citation needed] "},{"title":"Football Canada","content":"  Football Canada is the governing body for gridiron football in Canada headquartered in Ottawa, Ontario. Football Canada focuses primarily its own Canadian form of the sport, and is currently the world's only national governing body for Canadian football.  The governing body is also Canada's representative member of the International Federation of American Football (IFAF), the world's governing body for American football. In this capacity, it organizes the Canada men's national team which competes in IFAF competitions using American rules.  The organization, which is now known as Football Canada, was founded on June 12, 1880, as the Canadian Rugby Football Union, disbanded then revived on October 21, 1882, and re-organized as the Canadian Rugby Union on December 19, 1891.[2]  The CRU was founded to govern a sport which at the time had rules similar to the rugby football being played in the United Kingdom.  In 1909, Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey, Governor General of Canada, donated a trophy to the CRU to be awarded for the Rugby Football Championship of Canada.  This trophy became known as the Grey Cup.[citation needed][3][4]  Even by this time, however, the rules being played in Canada were vastly different from the rules used in countries that were part of the International Rugby Board (IRB).  In the years that followed, the CRU made numerous rule changes that resulted in a game reasonably similar to the American one but unrecognizable to a rugby union enthusiast.[citation needed]  In the early-1910s, CRU annual discussions dealing with rules changes due to the influence American football.[5] The CRU elected W. A. Hewitt president for the 1915 season. He appointed a commission to establish uniforms rules of play at different levels including collegiate and senior.[6] He approached multiple football coaches and sought feedback on best ways to implement standard playing rules.[7] After the CRU did not operate from 1916 to 1918 due to World War I,[8] Hewitt returned as president for the 1919 season.[9] Due to disagreements on playing rules in Western Canada, lack of interest in Eastern Canada, and students prioritizing studies instead of intercollegiate sports; national playoffs were not held in 1919.[8]  Despite the divergence, the sport continued to be referred to as rugby for many years. The CRU did not change its name despite the obvious confusion (rugby union was known as English rugby in Canada).  By the 1940s, however, another development was to cause further changes to the CRU's mandate.  It was now clear that two of its member leagues, the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union in Eastern Canada and the Western Interprovincial Football Union in the West were far more competitive than other circuits.[citation needed]  By the 1950s, the two major unions had become openly professional, and in 1956 formed the Canadian Football Council (CFC) as an umbrella organization.  In 1958, the CFC seceded from the CRU and became the Canadian Football League, whose teams became the sole competitors for the Grey Cup (though the amateurs had effectively been locked out since 1954). During the CFL's Grey Cup meetings in November 1966, the CRU transferred its ownership of the Grey Cup to a CFL trusteeship. In exchange, the CRU received $50,000 per year to assist the development of amateur football.[citation needed]  As an organization with no direct jurisdiction over the professional clubs and having become a distinct sport from rugby union by this time, the CRU changed its name to the Canadian Amateur Football Association (CAFA) in 1967.  The CAFA changed its name again to Football Canada in 1986.  In French, its name had long been Football Canada.[citation needed]  Men's  Women's  Played from 2014-20, the annual International Bowl series was a collaboration between Football Canada and USA Football featuring a series of exhibition games between the rival football nations in Texas in January and February. The event built on the previous International Bowl (2010 \u2013 2013) format of Team USA vs. Team World.  Canada's under-18 team for the International Bowl was selected from the top players and coaches at the prior summer's Football Canada Cup.  Football Canada offers coaches training through the National Coaching Certification Program (NCCP) for flag, touch and tackle football.  NCCP streams  As part of its NCCP program, Football Canada's Safe Contact module teaches safe contact tackling and blocking as well as concussion education. In 2014, the organization partnered with the CFL to further refine the program.[10]  These are the CRU champions before the dedication of the Grey Cup.  The 1909 game was the first game for the Grey Cup. See the article 'List of Grey Cup champions' for the complete Grey Cup listing.  Source: Ottawa Citizen, November 28, 1910, page 8. "},{"title":"Sports in Canada","content":"  Sports in Canada consist of a wide variety of games.  The roots of organized sports in Canada date back to the 1770s,[1] culminating in the development and popularization of the major professional games of ice hockey, lacrosse, basketball, baseball, soccer, football and cricket.[2] Canada's official national sports are ice hockey (winter official) and lacrosse (summer official).[3] Golf, baseball, tennis, skiing, ringette, badminton, cricket, volleyball, cycling, swimming, bowling, rugby union, canoeing, curling, squash, and the study of martial arts are widely enjoyed at the youth and amateur levels.[4] Great achievements in Canadian sports are recognized by Canada's Sports Hall of Fame,[5] while the Lou Marsh Trophy is awarded annually to Canada's top athlete by a panel of journalists.[6] There are numerous other Sports Halls of Fame in Canada.[5]  Canada shares several major professional sports leagues with the United States.[7] Canadian teams in these leagues include seven franchises in the National Hockey League, as well as three Major League Soccer teams and one team in each of Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association. Other popular professional sports in Canada include Canadian football, which is played in the Canadian Football League, National Lacrosse League lacrosse, and curling.[8]  Canada has enjoyed greater success at the Winter Olympics than at the Summer Olympics[9] and has hosted several high-profile international sporting events, including the 1976 Summer Olympics,[10] the 1988 Winter Olympics,[11] the 1994 Basketball World Championship,[12] the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup,[13] the 2010 Winter Olympics[14][15] and the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup.[16] Most recently, Canada hosted the 2015 Pan American Games and 2015 Parapan American Games in Toronto, the former being one of the largest sporting event hosted by the country.[17] The country is also scheduled to co-host the 2026 FIFA World Cup, alongside Mexico and the United States.[18]  The history of Canadian sports falls into five stages of development: early recreational activities before 1840; the start of organized competition, 1840\u20131880; the emergence of national organizations, 1882\u20131914; the rapid growth of both amateur and professional sports, 1914 to 1960; and developments of the last century [19]  Some sports, especially ice hockey, ringette, lacrosse, and curling, enjoy an international reputation as particularly Canadian.[20]  Federal and provincial governments are both actively involved in sports each has areas of jurisdiction which overlap sports. Sport Canada generally directs (or at least co-ordinates) federal activity in sports. While the federal government generally tries to take a leadership role in areas of international competition (where its jurisdiction is clearest) some provinces, especially Quebec, are actively involved in sports at all levels, even with elite international athletes.  Provinces will often focus on student athletics, as it falls more clearly in an area of provincial jurisdiction (that being education).[21]  U Sports is the national governing body for university sports, while the Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association governs college sports. A factor which affects athletic participation levels in U Sports member institutions is the U Sports restriction that scholarships cover tuition only, drawing many of Canada's best student athletes to the United States where organizations such as the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) allow \"full ride\" scholarships which include tuition, books, housing, and travel. Another is the popular Canadian Hockey League (for male hockey players aged 15 to 20), which effectively serves as the primary development league for the professional National Hockey League, although CHL teams offer financial support for players who choose to play U Sports hockey after leaving the CHL.  Canada has two de jure national sports: ice hockey and lacrosse.  In May 1964, former Canadian Amateur Hockey Association president and then current member of parliament Jack Roxburgh did extensive research to find if Canadian parliament had ever declared a national game, and specifically looked into whether lacrosse was officially declared. After going through parliamentary records, he found no law was ever enacted. The Canadian Press reported at the time that the myth of lacrosse as Canada's national game possibly came from a book published in 1869 titled Lacrosse, the National Game of Canada, and that the Canadian Lacrosse Association was founded in 1867.[22][23] His endeavour to declare hockey as Canada's national game coincided with the Great Canadian Flag Debate of 1964.[24] On October 28, 1964, Roxburgh moved to introduce Bill C\u2013132, with respect to declaring hockey as the national game of Canada.[25]  Canadian Lacrosse Association members responded to the motion by calling it insulting and \"out of line\", and vowed to fight it.[26] On June 11, 1965, Bob Prittie replied by introducing a separate bill to have lacrosse declared as Canada's national game and stated that, \"I think it is fitting at this time when we are considering national flags, national anthems and other national symbols, that this particular matter should be settled now\".[24] The choice of Canada's national game was debated in 1965, but neither bill was passed when parliament was dissolved.[27] In 1967, Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson proposed to name national summer and winter games, but nothing was resolved.[24]  In 1994, First Nations groups objected to a government bill that proposed establishing ice hockey as Canada's national sport, arguing that it neglected recognition of the game of lacrosse, a uniquely Indigenous contribution. In response, the House of Commons amended a bill \"to recognize hockey as Canada's Winter Sport and lacrosse as Canada's Summer Sport\". On May 12, 1994, the National Sports of Canada Act came into force with these designations.[28]  Although the legislation included seasonal designations, both sports can be played in different seasons. Lacrosse can be played all year, in all seasons, indoor and outdoors. During colder seasons ice hockey may be played indoor and outdoors, although in warmer seasons, its play requires the use of artificial ice, typically found at an indoor ice rink.  The modern form of ice hockey began in Canada in the late 19th century, and is widely considered Canada's national pastime, with high levels of participation by children, men and women at various levels of competition. The Stanley Cup, considered the premiere trophy in professional ice hockey, originated in Canada in 1893. Prominent trophies for national championships in Canada are the Memorial Cup for the top junior-age men's team and the Allan Cup for the top men's senior team. There are national championships in several other divisions of play. Hockey Canada is the sport's official governing body in Canada and is a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). A Canadian national men's team, composed of professionals, competes in the annual IIHF Men's World Championship and in the Olympics.  The National Hockey League (NHL) is a professional hockey league that includes teams from both Canada and the United States. Presently, the NHL includes seven teams in Canada: the Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers, Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, Toronto Maple Leafs, Vancouver Canucks, and the Winnipeg Jets. The Canadian NHL presence peaked with eight teams in the mid-1990s, before the Quebec Nordiques relocated to Denver, Colorado in 1995 and a previous incarnation of the Winnipeg Jets relocated to Phoenix, Arizona in 1996. The NHL returned to Winnipeg in 2011 when the Atlanta Thrashers relocated and became the current Winnipeg Jets. The league, founded in Canada, retains a substantial Canadian content as roughly half of its players are Canadian. Hockey Night in Canada is a longtime national Saturday night television broadcast featuring Canadian NHL teams. Junior-age ice hockey is also a popular spectator sport. The junior-age Canadian Hockey League is broadcast nationally and its annual Memorial Cup championship is a popular television event. The annual IIHF World U20 Championship, played during December and January, is popular among Canadian television viewers and has been held in Canada numerous times due to its popularity.  The First Nations began playing the sport more than 500 years ago. Today lacrosse not only remains an integral part of Indigenous culture, but is played by tens of thousands of people across Canada and the north eastern United States. From its origin as 'The Creator's Game' to the healthy popularity of the modern game, lacrosse has survived the test of time after treading down a long, controversial path that led it to become recognized as Canada's official national summer sport.  The Canadian Lacrosse Association, founded in 1925, is the governing body of lacrosse in Canada. It conducts national junior and senior championship tournaments for men and women in both field and box lacrosse. It also participated in the inaugural World Indoor Lacrosse Championship in 2003. As of 2018, the only active professional lacrosse league in Canada is the National Lacrosse League, which plays a variation of the game known as box lacrosse. A total of five of the league's thirteen franchises are located in Canada: the Vancouver Warriors, Calgary Roughnecks, Saskatchewan Rush, Toronto Rock, and Halifax Thunderbirds. The 2006 World Lacrosse Championship was held in London, Ontario. Canada beat the United States 15\u201310 in the final to break a 28-year U.S. winning streak. One of the best lacrosse players of all time, Gary Gait was born in Victoria, British Columbia and has won every possible major lacrosse championship. Great achievements in Canadian Lacrosse are recognized by the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame.  The world's first documented baseball game took place in Beachville, Ontario, on June 4, 1838.[citation needed]  Although more strongly associated with the United States, baseball has existed in Canada from the very beginning. The world's oldest baseball park still in operation is Labatt Park in London, Ontario.[citation needed] It is home to the London Majors of the semi-pro Intercounty Baseball League.  Presently, the Toronto Blue Jays are Canada's only Major League Baseball team, founded in 1977. The Montreal Expos (the first MLB team in Canada) played in Montreal from 1969 until 2004 when they moved to Washington, D.C., and became the Washington Nationals. The Blue Jays were the first non-American team to host a World Series Game (in 1992) and the only non-American team to win the World Series (back to back in 1992 and 1993). The Blue Jays had the highest attendance in Major League Baseball during the late 1980s and early 1990s.[29] Professional baseball has a long history in Canada, beginning with teams such as the London Tecumsehs, Montreal Royals, and Toronto Maple Leafs in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. All three were included on the National Baseball Association's top 100 minor league teams.  A number of Canadians have played in the major leagues, and several have won the highest honours in baseball. Ferguson Jenkins won the National League Cy Young Award in 1971 as the best pitcher in the league, and in 1991 became the first Canadian inducted in the (U.S.) Baseball Hall of Fame. Larry Walker, inducted in 2020, was National League MVP for the 1997 season and was the league's batting champion 3 times.  Since 2000, \u00c9ric Gagn\u00e9 won the National League Cy Young Award in 2003, Jason Bay was the first Canadian to be named rookie of the year in 2004, and Justin Morneau (American League, 2006), Joey Votto (National League, 2010) and Freddie Freeman (National League, 2020)[a] have won MVP honours.  The Canada national baseball team has participated in all editions of the World Baseball Classic. In the 2006 World Baseball Classic, the team upset Team USA in first-round play,[30] which some people in Canada call the \"Miracle on Dirt\" (a play on the phrase \"Miracle on Ice\" for the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey team). However, the team has yet to progress past the first round.  The only Canadian team in MLB-affiliated minor leagues is the Vancouver Canadians of the Northwest League (High-A). There are a number of independent minor league teams, as well as semi-professional and collegiate baseball teams in Canada (see List of baseball teams in Canada). Great achievements in Canadian baseball are recognized by the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame.  Basketball has very strong roots in Canada. The inventor, James Naismith, was Canadian; born in Almonte, Ontario, he was working as a physical education instructor in Massachusetts when he created the game in 1891. As many as 10 of the players in that first game were Canadian students from Quebec.[citation needed] Basketball is a popular sport in parts of Canada, especially in Nova Scotia, Southern Alberta, and more recently Southern Ontario.  The popularity of basketball in Nova Scotia is at the high school and college level.  Nova Scotia is home to three perennially strong college basketball programs. Saint Mary's University, Acadia University, and St. Francis Xavier University have made 22, 21, and 13 appearances in the U Sports men's championship, respectively. Carleton University has dominated the U Sports championship in recent years, winning 14 titles in 17 years from 2003 to the present.  Four Canadian-born individuals and one naturalized Canadian have been inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame\u2014Naismith and longtime U.S. college coach and instructor Pete Newell as contributors; Ernie Quigley, who officiated over 1,500 U.S. college games, as a referee; and Bob Houbregs, a superstar at the University of Washington in the early 1950s who went on to a career in the NBA. Newell is also separately recognized by the Hall as the head coach of the 1960 USA Olympic team, which won a gold medal in overwhelming fashion and was inducted as a unit in 2010. The most recent Canadian to enter the Naismith Hall is Steve Nash, born in South Africa but raised from early childhood in Victoria, British Columbia, a two-time NBA MVP who was inducted in 2016.  The National Basketball Association (NBA) recognizes its first ever game as being a contest between the New York Knickerbockers and Toronto Huskies at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens on November 1, 1946.[31] The NBA expanded into Canada in 1995 with the addition of the Toronto Raptors and Vancouver Grizzlies. The Grizzlies moved to Memphis, Tennessee in 2001, but the Raptors continue to draw healthy crowds at Scotiabank Arena. The Raptors won their first NBA title in 2019.  A record 16 Canadian players\u201414 born in the country and two naturalized\u2014were on NBA rosters at the start of the 2019\u201320\u00a0season. This was also a record for the number of players from any single non-U.S. country at the start of any NBA season.[32]  In Canada, the term \"football\" is used to refer to Canadian football, a gridiron-based game closely related to but distinct from American football as played in the United States. Canadian football has its origins in Rugby football beginning in the early 1860s,[33] but, over time, a unique code known as Canadian football developed. The first documented football match was a game played at University College, University of Toronto on November 9, 1861. One of the participants in the game involving University of Toronto students was (Sir) William Mulock, later Chancellor of the school. A football club was formed at the university soon afterward, although its rules of play at this stage are unclear. In 1864, at Trinity College, Toronto, F. Barlow Cumberland and Frederick A. Bethune devised rules based on rugby football.  However, modern Canadian football is widely regarded as having originated with a game of rugby played in Montreal, in 1865, when British Army officers played local civilians. The game gradually gained a following, and the Montreal Football Club was formed in 1868, the first recorded non-university football club in Canada. This \"rugby-football\" soon became popular at Montreal's McGill University. McGill challenged Harvard University to a game, in 1874. The game grew separately in parallel from this point onward in the U.S. and Canada.  Both the Canadian Football League (CFL), the sport's only professional league in Canada, and Football Canada, the governing body for amateur play, trace their roots to 1884 and the founding of the Canadian Rugby Football Union. Currently active teams such as the Toronto Argonauts and Hamilton Tiger-Cats have similar longevity. The CFL's championship game, the Grey Cup, is the country's single largest sporting event and is watched by nearly one third of Canadian television households.[34] The nine CFL teams are the BC Lions, Calgary Stampeders, Edmonton Elks, Saskatchewan Roughriders, Winnipeg Blue Bombers, Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Toronto Argonauts, Ottawa Redblacks, and Montreal Alouettes. A tenth team, the Halifax-based Atlantic Schooners, is currently in the planning stages.  Canadian football is also played at the high school, junior, collegiate, semi-professional, and amateur levels. The Canadian Junior Football League and Quebec Junior Football League are for players aged 18\u201322. Post-secondary institutions in U Sports compete for the Vanier Cup. Canada also has three women's leagues: the Maritime Women's Football League, the Central Canadian Women's Football League, and the Western Women's Canadian Football League. The WWCFL is the biggest women's league, featuring seven teams in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. Senior leagues such as the Alberta Football League have also grown in popularity in recent years. Great achievements in Canadian football are recognized by the Canadian Football Hall of Fame; located at Tim Hortons Field in Hamilton, Ontario.  The earliest reports of cricket in Canada date from 1785 where games seem to have taken place in Montreal. The first reference to cricket being played on an organized basis is in 1834 when a club was founded in Toronto and there are reports of matches being played in Hamilton and Guelph. Along with the United States, Canada was one of the two participants in the first international cricket match, which took place in September 1884. In 1867, Canadian prime minister John A. MacDonald and his cabinet declared cricket to be Canada's first official sport.[35][36]  Curling competitions in Canada include the Montana's Brier (national men's championship) and Scotties Tournament of Hearts (national women's championship.) Men's and women's (and mixed teams) national champions move on to annual international competitions, where Canadian teams have historically dominated (even over the country of curling's origin, Scotland).  The Continental Cup features a Canada vs. The World format. Professional curling competitions include the Grand Slam of Curling, part of the World Curling Tour. Curling Canada is the sport's national governing body; achievements are recognized by the Canadian Curling Hall of Fame.  In Canada, organized disc sports began in the early 1970s, with promotional efforts from Irwin Toy (Frisbee distributor in Canada), the Canadian Open Frisbee Championships, Toronto (1972\u201385) and professionals using Frisbee show tours to perform at universities, fairs and sporting events.[37] Disc sports such as freestyle, disc dog (with a human handler throwing discs for a dog to catch), double disc court, guts, ultimate and disc golf became this sport's first events.[38][39] Two sports, the team sport of disc ultimate and disc golf are very popular worldwide and are now being played semi-professionally.[40][41] The World Flying Disc Federation, Professional Disc Golf Association, and the Freestyle Players Association are the rules and sanctioning organizations for flying disc sports worldwide. Ultimate Canada is the rules and sanctioning organization for disc ultimate in Canada.[42]  In 2013, as a founding partner, the Toronto Ultimate Club presented Canada's first semi-professional Ultimate team, the Toronto Rush, to the American Ultimate Disc League (AUDL). They went undefeated 18\u20130 and won the AUDL Championships.[43][44][45] In 2014, the Montreal Royal and the Vancouver Riptide joined the AUDL. From 2015 to 2022, the Ottawa Outlaws competed in the AUDL, becoming the fourth Canadian franchise of 26 teams in total.  In 2015, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) granted full recognition to the World Flying Disc Federation (WFDF) for flying disc sports including Ultimate.[46][47]  Ringette first appeared in Canada in 1963 after it was first conceptualized by Sam Jacks, a former Toronto YMCA director who served as a Canadian soldier during World War II. Created specifically for girls[48] by Sam Jacks while he was living in North Bay, Ontario, the sport is now most popularly played by girls and women of all ages and has experienced its greatest success in Canada and Finland. Unlike most organized sports, all of ringette's top athletes are female, one of the sport's most distinctive features.  By the 1980s, ringette surpassed female ice hockey in national registrations.[49] While the sport lost potential talent once women's ice hockey became an Olympic sport, the 21st century has seen the sport regain popularity.[50][51]  Canada's semi-professional ringette league, the National Ringette League (NRL) formed in 2004, becoming the first winter team sports league in North America to feature elite female athletes rather than male. The NRL acts as a showcase league for the sport.  Rugby league first appeared in Canada in the 20th century, although by the end of the 1980s, the sport had disappeared entirely from the nation. However, the 21st century has seen the game gain popularity in Canada. Internationally, Canada is represented by the Canadian Wolverines. Domestically, the Canada Rugby League (CRL) runs several amateur and semi-professional club competitions.  Toronto Wolfpack, the first fully professional team of any code of rugby football in Canada, began play in 2017 in the predominantly British and French Rugby Football League system. The franchise started in the 3rd tier League 1, which offers a route to the Super League and won promotion to the 2nd tier Championship in its inaugural season. The Wolfpack spent two seasons in the Championship before earning promotion to Super League for the 2020 season. In July 2020, the team withdrew from the remainder of the Super League season due to \"overwhelming financial challenges\" caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.[52] In November 2020, the Wolfpack\u2019s application for readmission to Super League for the 2021 was rejected.[53]  Canada has around 13,000 seniors and twice as many junior players spread across the country. Many of these come from Canada's rugby stronghold of British Columbia while also being strong in Newfoundland and Ontario. The Canadian Rugby Championship is the premier domestic rugby union competition since 2009, featuring four regionally based Canadian teams. In 2009, the top two teams advanced to the Americas Rugby Championship, where they faced the A national teams from Argentina and the United States. From 2010 to 2015, the country was represented at the ARC by one team, Canada A. Starting in 2016, the competition was revamped along the lines of Europe's Six Nations Championship and the Southern Hemisphere's Rugby Championship. Since that time, Canada's senior national team has competed in the ARC alongside senior national sides from Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and the United States, plus Argentina's A national team.  The sport's domestic governing body, Rugby Canada, scrapped its previous national competition, the Rugby Canada Super League, in favour of a new national under-20 league, the Rugby Canada National Junior Championship.  The Canadian national side have competed in every Rugby World Cup to date, yet have only won one match each tournament with the exception of the 1991 tournament where they reached the quarterfinals; the 2007 tournament when their best result was a draw against Japan in the group stage; and the 2019 tournament, when they went winless in their first three group matches and then saw their final match against Namibia cancelled and scored as a draw due to an impending typhoon.  Highlights include famous victories over Scotland and Wales, and until recently frequent wins over their North American neighbours, the United States. However, since 2013, the U.S. has dominated the rivalry, with 11 wins and one draw from the teams' last 12 matches. Known for their trademark \"hard nosed\" style of play, many Canadian players play their trade professionally in English and French leagues.  The Toronto Arrows professional rugby union club debuted September 2017, and started play in Major League Rugby as of 2019.[54] The Arrows team, an independent off-shoot of the Ontario Blues Rugby Football Club, features mostly Canadian players and staff. The team's home field is York Lions Stadium on the Keele Campus of York University.  Soccer has been played in Canada since 1876. The Dominion of Canada Football Association was inaugurated on May 24, 1912, and initially became a member of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association on December 31, 1912. Today, Canada's governing body for soccer (both professional and amateur) is known as the Canadian Soccer Association.  Soccer is the highest participation sport in Canada, with 847,616 registered players (according to the Canada Soccer 2012 Yearbook). Male\/female participation is split roughly 59\/41 percent. There are 1,456 clubs in 139 districts across 12 regions (provincial and territory member associations).  Canada's annual amateur competition is known as the National Championships. Senior men's teams play for The Challenge Trophy while senior women's teams play for The Jubilee Trophy. The men's national competition was first played in 1913, with the trophy (Connaught Cup) donated by Canadian Governor-General, the Duke of Connaught. The women's national competition was first played in 1982. The Canadian Soccer Association's annual National Championships also feature competitions at the U-18, U-16 and U-14 levels. At all levels, clubs qualify for the National Championships through their respective provincial championships.  At the St. Louis 1904 Olympics, Canada won the gold medal in soccer. The Canadian team was represented by Galt FC of Ontario. From 1967 to 1988, Canada's best men's amateur soccer players also participated in Olympic Qualifying tournaments (although in the 1980s a number of those players were indeed professional). Canada qualified as host of the Montr\u00e9al 1976 Olympics and then again for the Los Angeles 1984 Olympics (where it finished fifth overall). Since the early 1990s, the Men's olympic qualifying tournaments have featured U-23 players (with a mix of professional and amateur\/university players).  Canada's annual professional competition is the Canadian Championship, which is contested between Toronto FC, Vancouver Whitecaps FC, CF Montr\u00e9al, all nine Canadian Premier League teams, and the champions of League1 British Columbia, League1 Ontario, and the Premi\u00e8re Ligue de soccer du Qu\u00e9bec.[55] The national champion qualifies for the CONCACAF Champions Cup, from which a confederation champion then qualifies for the annual FIFA Club World Cup. Toronto FC is the only Canadian club to have won the MLS Cup, having done so on December 9, 2017.[56]  A minority of the teams in the Canadian Championship play in U.S.-based leagues. Toronto FC, Vancouver Whitecaps FC and CF Montr\u00e9al play in Major League Soccer. FC Edmonton played in the second-level North American Soccer League until going dormant in late 2017, and Ottawa Fury FC voluntarily dropped from the NASL to the third-level United Soccer League, now known as the USL Championship (USLC), after the 2016 season. FC Edmonton ultimately resumed professional operations in 2019 as inaugural Canadian Premier League members,[57] while Fury FC continued in the USLC until folding after the 2019 season.  Two other Canadian professional sides play in U.S.-based leagues. Toronto FC's reserve side, Toronto FC II, which is ineligible for the Canadian Championship due to its relation to the MLS side, started play in the league now known as the USLC in 2014, and remained at that level through the 2018 season. In 2019, TFC II moved to the new third-level USL League One, continuing to play in that league through the 2021 season before moving to the newly established MLS Next Pro, a different third-level league made up almost entirely of MLS reserve sides, in 2022. Whitecaps FC revived its former reserve side of Whitecaps FC 2 in 2022 after a five-year hiatus, with Whitecaps 2 also playing in Next Pro. Whitecaps 2, also ineligible for the Canadian Championship due to its relationship with the MLS side, will adopt a new name after the 2023 season.  The Canadian Premier League (CPL) is a professional soccer league that began play in spring 2019, consisting of an initial seven teams; one is based in the outer suburbs of Toronto, with all others in Canadian markets not served by Major League Soccer. An eighth team, Atl\u00e9tico Ottawa, began CPL play in 2020, while Vancouver FC debuted in 2023 as the league's ninth team. Two more teams have been announced for Saskatoon and Windsor, but no entry dates have been announced. The league has a minimum requirement of Canadian players on each roster and an annual draft of U Sports players, to develop Canadian talent. The eventual goal of the league is to have multiple divisions with promotion and relegation. Effective with the 2023 season, the team that tops the CPL regular-season table and the winner of the postseason playoffs qualify for the following year's CONCACAF Champions Cup.  Canada's best soccer players\u2014male and female\u2014play in professional leagues around the world. Players are called into the national program at different times of the year, primarily in conjunction with the FIFA International Calendar (when professional clubs are required to release players for national duty).  Canada's national teams compete in CONCACAF, the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football. Canada's national \"A\" team has won two CONCACAF championships: in 1985 to qualify for the 1986 FIFA World Cup and in 2000 to qualify for the FIFA Confederations Cup.  In 2022, the men's side finished first in the final CONCACAF qualifying group for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. They have also qualified for the 2026 FIFA World Cup as hosts.  Canada's women's \"A\" team has also won two CONCACAF championships: in 1998 and 2010. The Canadian women have participated in six FIFA Women's World Cups (Sweden 1995, United States 1999, United States 2003, China 2007, Germany 2011 and as hosts in 2015) and four Women's Olympic Football Tournaments (Beijing 2008, London 2012, Rio 2016, and Tokyo 2020\/21), winning bronze medals in both London and Rio and gold in Tokyo. Canada also hosted the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2015. The country has also hosted four age-grade World Cups\u2014the FIFA U-17 World Cup in 1987 (when the age limit was 16 instead of the current 17), the inaugural FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup in 2002 (when the age limit was 19 instead of 20), the FIFA U-20 World Cup in 2007, and the U-20 Women's World Cup for a second time in 2014. Canada will host the 2026 FIFA World Cup jointly with Mexico and the United States.[58]  Australian rules football in Canada is a minor participation sport and is governed by AFL Canada. The sport has been played in the country since 1989 when the first league was formed. The sport is quickly becoming popular,[citation needed] with the Ontario Australian Football League being the biggest outside of Australia.[citation needed] The men's Canada national Australian rules football team and a women's national team both who regularly play international matches and play in the Australian Football International Cup which is essentially a World Cup for all countries apart from Australia which is the only place where the sport is played professionally. Mike Pyke became the first Canadian to play in the Australian Football League when he was drafted by the Sydney Swans in 2008, and became the first Canadian to play in an AFL premiership (championship-winning) team when the Swans won the 2012 AFL Grand Final.  Cricket in Canada never caught on the way it did in the rest of the British Empire.[59] While Canada is not sanctioned to play Test matches, the national team does take part in One Day International (ODI) matches and also in first-class games (in the ICC Intercontinental Cup) against other non-Test-playing opposition, with a rivalry against the United States. The match between these two nations is in fact the oldest international fixture in cricket, having first been played in 1844.  Canada has participated in the 1979, 2003 and 2007 Cricket World Cups, and qualified for the 2011 Cricket World Cup.[60] In February 2018, the ICC sanctioned the Global T20 Canada, the first franchise-based Twenty20 league in North America.[61][62]  Canada featured a men's national team in beach volleyball that competed at the 2018\u20132020 NORCECA Beach Volleyball Continental Cup.[63]  The sport of bowling takes several forms in Canada, including ten-pin and lawn bowling, but most notably Canada has its own version: Five-pin bowling, which was invented circa 1909 by Thomas F. Ryan in Toronto, Ontario, at his Toronto Bowling Club, in response to customers who complained that the ten-pin game was too strenuous. He cut five tenpins down to about 75% of their size, and used hand-sized hard rubber balls, thus inventing the original version of five-pin bowling.[64] Five-pin is played in all parts of Canada, but not played in any other country.  Candlepin bowling, regulated by the International Candlepin Bowling Association in both Canada and the United States, is played at several centres in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.  In Quebec, a variation of duckpin bowling is played using pins with rubber bands around their widest section, known in French as petites quilles.[65]  Canada has produced several boxing world champions, including heavyweights Tommy Burns and Lennox Lewis. Boxing is generally learned in independent gyms, located in most large Canadian cities. Canadian boxers compete in the Olympic Games and often then turn professional.  The Japanese martial art Judo has been practised in Canada for nearly a century. The first Judo dojo in Canada, Tai Iku Dojo, was established in Vancouver in 1924 by Shigetaka \"Steve\" Sasaki.[66] Today, an estimated 30,000 Canadians participate in Judo programs in approximately 400 clubs across Canada.[67]  Canadians have won five Olympic medals in Judo since it was added to the Summer games in 1964. Doug Rogers won silver in the +80\u00a0kg category in 1964, Mark Berger won bronze in the +95\u00a0kg category in 1984, Nicolas Gill won bronze in the 86\u00a0kg category in 1992 and silver in the 100\u00a0kg category in 2000, and Antoine Valois-Fortier won bronze in the \u221281\u00a0kg category in 2012. The Canadian Judo team trains at the National Training Centre in Montreal under Gill's direction.[68]  Canada has produced several notable MMA fighters, appearing in the UFC and other promotions. Canada is the home of former UFC Welterweight and Middleweight Champion Georges St-Pierre, former Bellator MMA Welterweight Champion Rory McDonald, as well as PFL 2022 Lightweight Tournament and 2023 Lightweight Tournament Champion Olivier Aubin-Mercier.  Wrestling in Canada is very popular both as a recreational and as a competitive sport, and takes a variety of forms, reflecting Canada's diverse and multicultural makeup. At the middle, high school and collegiate level there is a broad-based varsity participation in Freestyle Wrestling and Greco-Roman Wrestling. Outside of schools among the general population, the dominant forms of wrestling are Judo, Submission Grappling, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu and Sambo. Each of these forms of wrestling was brought to Canada from abroad both by coaches who immigrated to Canada from elsewhere and by students of the sport who studied it overseas and returned with their enthusiasm. Examples of famous Canadian wrestlers among these various wrestling sports are such as Daniel Igali for Freestyle Wrestling, Nicolas Gill, Ron Angus and Keith Morgan for Judo, Marc Bocek for both Submission Grappling and Brazilian Jiu-jitsu. Canada has a strong showing on the international scene, at world championships and at the Olympics in all these wrestling sports.  Cycling has increased its participation in the past few years. Several new genres of the sport have become popular in Canada, including slopestyle competition, four cross, downhill mountain biking, dirt jumping, and freeride. With the sport increasing bikes have also increased in quality and durability.  Golf is a widely enjoyed recreational sport in Canada, and the country boasts several highly rated courses. Golf Canada is the governing organization, and has over 1,600 associated member clubs and over 300,000 individual members.[69] Golf Canada also conducts the only PGA Tour and LPGA Tour events in Canada, and it also manages the Canadian Golf Hall of Fame. PGA Tour Canada (also known as the Canadian Tour), owned and operated by the PGA Tour since late 2012, operates an organization that runs a series of tournaments for professional players. In its first season under PGA Tour operation in 2013, it held a qualifying school in California, and followed it with nine tournaments in Canada. The 2014 season saw significant expansion. Three qualifying schools were held\u2014one in California, another in Florida, and finally in British Columbia. The BC qualifier was followed by a series of 12 tournaments, all in Canada. The top five money-winners on the tour earn full membership in the following season of the PGA Tour's second-level Korn Ferry Tour.  Twenty-seven Canadians have won a total of 80 events on the PGA and LPGA tours, combined. Ontario's Mike Weir won the 2003 Masters Tournament, becoming the first Canadian man to win one of golf's majors. The first Canadian to win any recognized major championship was Sandra Post, winner of the 1968 LPGA Championship. From 1979 through 2000, the du Maurier Classic (now known as the Canadian Women's Open) was one of the LPGA's four majors. The most recent Canadian of either gender to win a major championship was Brooke Henderson, who won the 2016 KPMG Women's PGA Championship and the 2022 Evian Championship.  While tennis is not a huge sport in Canada, there have been several Canadian players who have had success in the last decade. Milos Raonic is regarded as one of the most successful Canadian male players in history. His career-high No. 3 ranking, as of November 21, 2016, is the highest ever ranking for a Canadian man. He is the first Canadian male in the Open Era to reach the Australian Open semi-finals (2016), the French Open (2014) quarterfinals, and the Wimbledon final (2016). In women's singles, Eugenie Bouchard became the first Canadian-born player representing Canada to reach the final of a Grand Slam tournament in singles, finishing runner-up to Petra Kvitov\u00e1 at the 2014 Wimbledon Championships.  She also reached the semi-finals of the 2014 Australian Open and 2014 French Open. Later in the same year she received the WTA Most Improved Player award for the 2014 season and reached a career-high ranking of No. 5, becoming the first Canadian female tennis player to be ranked in the top 5 in singles.  Canada has also had success in tennis during the late 2010s and into the 2020s with talents such as Denis Shapovalov and F\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime. On October 20, 2019, Shapovalov beat Filip Krajinovi\u0107 in the Stockholm Open, winning his first ATP title. Later, during the final event of the year, the Paris Rolex Masters, Shapovalov secured a top 20-year end finish after reaching the semi-finals. He reached the final as well, but lost to Novak Djokovic 6\u20133 6\u20134. He finished the season at a career high ranking of number 15. Auger-Aliassime reached a career high ATP singles ranking of No. 6 on November 7, 2022. Auger-Aliassime and Shapovalov were centrepieces of Canada's first Davis Cup-winning team in 2022.  Another notable men's player is Daniel Nestor, born in the former Yugoslavia but raised from early childhood in Toronto, who never broke into the top 50 in singles but was one of the greatest doubles players in history. During his long professional career (1991\u20132018), he won 91 ATP doubles titles (trailing only the Bryan brothers) and 12 Grand Slam men's doubles events, an Olympic gold medal in men's doubles in 2000 with S\u00e9bastien Lareau, and four titles at the ATP Finals. He was also the first men's player to win all Slam and Masters events, the ATP Finals, and an Olympic gold medal.  In recent women's tennis, Bianca Andreescu won the 2019 Rogers Cup in Toronto, where she defeated two current top-ten players in Kiki Bertens and Karol\u00edna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1. In the final, Serena Williams experienced back spasms and was forced to retire while down 1\u20133 in the first set.[70] This gave Bianca her second WTA title, and a new career-high ranking of 14.[71] With the three top-ten wins at the tournament, she won her first seven matches against top-ten opponents.[70] At the US Open, she reached her maiden Grand Slam final, where she defeated Serena Williams, becoming the first Canadian representing Canada to win a Grand Slam singles title.[72]  The largest tennis tournament held in Canada is the Canadian Open, also known as Rogers Cup, and is the second-oldest tournament in all of tennis (behind only Wimbledon). The Canadian Open's men's competition is a Masters 1000 event on the ATP tour. The women's competition is a WTA 1000 event on the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) tour. The competition is played on hard courts. The events alternate from year to year between the cities of Montreal and Toronto. Since 1980 in odd-numbered years the men's tournament is held in Montreal, while the women's tournament is held in Toronto, and vice versa in even-numbered years. Before 2011, they were held during separate weeks in the July\u2013August period; now the two competitions are held during the same week in August. The Toronto tournament is held at the Aviva Centre and the Montreal tournament is held at the IGA Stadium.  The Canadian Grand Prix Formula One auto race had been conducted every year since 1967, and since 1978 had been held at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal, apart from 1987 when a dispute arose between brewers Labatts and Molson over sponsorship, again in 2009 when the race was not on the FIA calendar for one year,[73] and most recently in 2020[74] and 2021[75] due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The track was named for Canada's first Grand Prix driver, the late Gilles Villeneuve, whose son, Jacques, won the Formula One World championship in 1997.  Several Canadians have starred in American Championship Car Racing, most notably Jacques Villeneuve, who won the 1995 CART championship and Indianapolis 500 before moving to Formula One, and Paul Tracy, who captured the 2003 CART title and collected 31 race wins. Races were held in Mont-Tremblant and Mosport road courses and on street circuits in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and Edmonton. In 2008, Champ Car merged with its long-time rival, the Indy Racing League (since renamed INDYCAR), under the banner of the latter body's top series, the IndyCar Series. The Edmonton race was transferred over to the new series immediately, and the Toronto event was added for 2009.  CASCAR (the Canadian Association for Stock Car Auto Racing) was the country's governing body for amateur and professional stock car racing, and the CASCAR Super Series was the highest-level stock car racing series in the country. In 2006, NASCAR purchased CASCAR and rebranded the Super Series as the NASCAR Canadian Tire Series, now known as the NASCAR Pinty's Series; nevertheless, the series remains Canada's top-level stock car racing circuit. In 2007 the Castrol Canadian Touring Car Championship was formed. Because Canada is NASCAR's largest market outside the United States, NASCAR brought the NAPA Auto Parts 200 Busch Series (now Xfinity Series) race to Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in 2007.[76] The race remained on the schedule until being discontinued after the 2012 season. Beginning the next year, NASCAR brought the Truck Series to Mosport with the Chevrolet Silverado 250.  Canadians have combined to win 53 races in American Championship Car Racing (Including 1 Indianapolis 500), 17 races in Formula 1 and 7 races in NASCAR's top 3 divisions (1 in the Cup Series).  The Canadian Professional Rodeo Association is the governing body that sanctions professional rodeo events in Canada.  The most well-known event is at the Calgary Stampede, normally held annually in July, and the Canadian Finals Rodeo, the national championship rodeo, is held in November each year.  Shooting sports are a part of Canada's cultural heritage. Many Canadians enjoy participating in the various disciplines that make up this broad sport. In the past decade shooting sports in Canada have seen a major surge of popularity as more and more Canadians are applying for firearms licences.[77]  At the recreational level individuals and families can be found across the nation improving their marksmanship skills at various private and public shooting ranges. Hunting is also a popular activity due to Canada's vast wilderness and pioneer past.[78]  At the competitive level, many Canadians train in Olympic events. There are also a variety of other competitive shooting sports that operate provincially, nationally and internationally through their respective organizations.  Major multi-sport events with Canadian participation, or that have taken place in Canada, are the Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games, Canada Games, World Championships in Athletics, Pan American Games, and the Universiade. Others include the North American Indigenous Games, the World Police and Fire Games, and the Gay Games.  The Canada Games is a high-level multi-sport event with held every two years in Canada, alternating between the Canada Winter Games and the Canada Summer Games. Athletes are strictly amateur only, and represent their province or territory. Since their inception, the Canada Games have played a prominent role in developing some of Canada's premier athletes, including Lennox Lewis, Catriona Le May Doan, Hayley Wickenheiser, Sidney Crosby, Martin Brodeur, Steve Nash, Suzanne Gaudet and David Ling. The Games were first held in 1967 in Quebec City as part of Canada's Centennial celebrations. Similar events are held on the provincial level, such as the annual BC Games.  Canada is one of only six nations to have attended every Commonwealth Games, and hosted the first ever British Empire Games in 1930 in Hamilton, Ontario. Canada also hosted the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Vancouver, British Columbia, the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Alberta, and the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, British Columbia. Canada ranks third in the all-time medal tally of Commonwealth Games.  Canada has competed at every Olympic Games, except for the first games in 1896 and the boycotted games in 1980. Canada has previously hosted the games three times, at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, and the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.  At the summer games, the majority of Canada's medals come from the sports of athletics, aquatics (swimming, synchronized swimming and diving), rowing and canoeing\/kayaking. In the post-boycott era (since 1988), Canada's medal total ranks 19th in the world, with the highest rank of 11th in 1992 and the lowest of 24th in 2000.  At the winter games, Canada is usually one of the top nations in terms of medals won. Canada is traditionally strong in the sports of ice hockey, speed skating (especially the short track variation), figure skating and most of the national men's and women's curling teams have won medals since the sport was added to the Olympic program.  Because Canada failed to win any gold medals at the 1976 Summer and 1988 Winter games, soon after Vancouver-Whistler was awarded the 2010 Winter Olympics several organizations including Sport Canada and the Canadian Olympic Committee began collaborations to launch \"Own the Podium \u2013 2010\", a development program to help Canada earn the most medals at the 2010 Games. Canada did not win the most total medals at the Vancouver Olympics (they finished third, behind the United States, whose 37 total medals was the most of any country at a single Winter Olympics, and Germany, with 26), but did win the most gold medals, with 14, the most of any country at a single Winter Olympics.  The National Sport School in Calgary, founded 1994, is the first Canadian high school designed exclusively for Olympic-calibre athletes.  Canada has participated in each of the Pan American Games since the second edition of the games, held in Mexico City in 1955. The fifth games took place in Winnipeg in 1967, Canada's Centennial year. Winnipeg hosted again in 1999. Toronto was selected as the host city for the 2015 games, which was held in July 2015 in venues located in Toronto and several surrounding municipalities.[79]  Canadian athletes are world-ranked in many amateur sports. These include the 'winter' sports of alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, figure skating, freestyle skiing, snowboarding, speed skating, ringette, biathlon, and curling. In ice hockey, Canada supports national teams for both men and women in the under-20 and under-18 categories. In 'summer' sports, Canadians participate in rugby, soccer, disc ultimate, track and field among most sports presented in the Summer Olympics. There are sports federations for most sports in Canada. Funding for amateur athletics is provided by governments, private companies and individual citizens through donation. Organisations like the FANS Foundation additionally provide a pathway for under-18 newcomers for more amateur sports in Canada.   Major television broadcasters of sports in Canada include CBC Television, T\u00e9l\u00e9vision de Radio-Canada, The Sports Network (TSN), R\u00e9seau des sports (RDS), Sportsnet, and The Score. A consortium led by CTVglobemedia outbid CBC for the broadcast rights to the 2010 Winter Olympics and 2012 Summer Olympics. Major national weekly sports broadcasts include Hockey Night in Canada and Friday Night Football. There are sports radio stations in most major Canadian cities as well as on satellite radio.  (Rankings current as of February 10, 2022) "},{"title":"Fouls and misconduct (association football)","content":"  In the sport of association football, fouls and misconduct are acts committed by players which are deemed by the referee to be unfair and are subsequently penalised. An offence may be a foul, misconduct or both depending on the nature of the offence and the circumstances in which it occurs. Fouls and misconduct are addressed in Law 12 of the Laws of the Game. A foul is an unfair act by a player, deemed by the referee to contravene the game's laws, that interferes with the active play of the match. Fouls are punished by the award of a free kick (possibly a penalty kick) to the opposing team. A list of specific offences that can be fouls are detailed in Law 12 of the Laws of the Game (other infractions, such as technical infractions at restarts, are not deemed to be fouls); these mostly concern unnecessarily aggressive physical play and the offence of handling the ball. An infringement is classified as a foul when it meets all the following conditions:  For example, a player striking the referee or a teammate is not a foul, but is misconduct.[1]  Misconduct is any conduct by a player that is deemed by the referee to warrant a disciplinary sanction (caution or dismissal). Misconduct may include acts which are, additionally, fouls. Unlike fouls, misconduct may occur at any time, including when the ball is out of play, during half-time and before and after the game, and both players and substitutes may be sanctioned for misconduct.  Misconduct will result in the player either receiving a caution (indicated by a yellow card) or being dismissed (\"sent off\") from the field (indicated by a red card).[1]:\u200a38\u200a A dismissed player cannot be replaced; their team is required to play the remainder of the game with one fewer player. A second caution results in the player being dismissed. The referee has considerable discretion in applying the Laws; in particular, the offence of unsporting behaviour may be used to deal with most events that violate the spirit of the game, even if they are not listed as specific offences.[1]:\u200a123\u200a  The system of cautioning and dismissal has existed in the Laws since 1881.[2] Association football was the first sport to introduce penalty cards to indicate the referee's decisions; a practice since adopted by many other sports. The first major use of the cards was in the 1970 FIFA World Cup, but they were not made mandatory at all levels until 1992.[3]  The rules divide fouls into two categories depending on the type of free kick awarded to the opposition, either a direct or indirect free kick.  Direct free kicks offences are the more common type of foul. If a direct free kick is awarded in the penalty area of the offending player's team, a penalty kick is awarded.[4]:\u200a117\u200a  The majority of fouls concern contact between opponents. Although contact between players is a part of the game, the Laws prohibit most forceful contact, meaning that, unlike other football codes, a tackle in association football is required to be predominantly directed against the ball rather than the player in possession of it. Specifically the rules prohibit charging, jumping at, kicking (or attempting to kick), pushing, striking (or attempting to strike), tripping (or attempting to trip), tackling or challenging an opponent in a manner considered to be careless, reckless or \"using excessive force\". Being careless makes it an offence, being reckless makes it a cautionable offence and using excessive force makes it a sending-off offence. Such classification of contact is a matter of judgement for the referee.  The handball offence is also penalised with a direct free kick. Players in association football are prohibited from touching the ball below the shoulder while the ball is in play, with the exception of the goalkeeper in their penalty area. When determining a handball offence, not every touch of the player's hand\/arm to the ball is an offence. The area of the arm in line with the bottom of the armpit and above is allowed to touch the ball.[5] Unavoidable accidental contact is not penalised - such as if the ball is struck against a player's arm at short range and the player could not have reasonably avoided the contact. However, if the player has positioned their arm so as to make their body \"unnaturally bigger\" and contact occurs, this is considered handball. Additionally, if a player scores in the opponent's goal with their hand or arm, even if accidental and unavoidable, this is considered handball and the goal does not stand.[4]:\u200a98\u200a The goalkeeper also has the same rules regarding handballs outside of the penalty area. If the goalkeeper handles the ball inside the penalty area when not allowed to do so, an indirect free kick is awarded.[5]\u00a0  Direct free kicks are also awarded for holding an opponent, impeding them with contact, biting or spitting at other persons, throwing an object (other than the ball) at an opponent or match official, or making contact with the ball with a held object.  An indirect free kick is awarded if a player:  An indirect free kick is awarded if a goalkeeper, inside their penalty area, commits any of the following offences:  An indirect free kick is also awarded if an offside offence occurs, though offside is not considered a foul and will never be punished by a caution or dismissal.  Indirect free kicks are taken from the place where the offence occurred, even if it was inside the offending player's penalty area. If the offence took place inside their goal area the indirect free kick is taken from the nearest point on the goal area line which runs parallel to the goal line.[4]:\u200a113\u200a  Not all infractions of the Laws are fouls. Non-foul infractions may be dealt with as technical infractions (e.g. as breaching the rules governing the restarts of play) or misconduct (these are punishable by a caution or sending-off). Persistent infringement of the Laws is an offence for which the player may be cautioned.[1]:\u200a38\u200a    The referee may consider serious or persistent offences to be misconduct worthy of an official caution or dismissal from the game. Association football was the first sport to use coloured cards to indicate these actions.[6]  A yellow card is shown by the referee to indicate that a player has been officially cautioned.[1]:\u200a38\u200a The player's details are then recorded by the referee in a small notebook; hence a caution is also known as a \"booking\". A player who has been cautioned may continue playing in the game; however, a player who receives a second caution in a match is sent off (shown the yellow card again, and then a red card). Law 12 of the Laws of the Game lists the types of offences and misconduct that may result in a caution. Players can be cautioned and shown a yellow card if they commit the following offences:   There are also two offences which apply in matches using the video assistant referee system:  What constitutes cautionable unsporting behaviour is generally at the referee's discretion, though Law 12 lists a number of examples.[4]:\u200a103\u200a These include simulation intended to deceive the referee, or attempting to score by handling the ball. Fouls which are committed recklessly or fouls which are committed with the intention of breaking up a promising attack are also considered unsporting behaviour and punishable with a yellow card. Fouls which are committed with excessive force, however, or which are deliberately committed to deny an obvious goalscoring opportunity for the player fouled (i.e. a professional foul),[8] are punishable by a red card.  The Laws state that goals may be celebrated, but that such celebrations should not be \"excessive\". Removing one's shirt or covering  one's face with the shirt will result in a caution. Players may also be cautioned for climbing onto a perimeter fence or approaching\/entering spectator areas in a manner that causes safety and\/or security concerns.[9]  In most tournaments, the accumulation of a certain number of yellow cards over several matches results in a suspension of the offending player for a certain number of subsequent matches, the exact number of cards and matches varying by jurisdiction. In the UEFA Champions League, for instance, accumulating two yellow cards in a stage of the tournament will lead to a one-game suspension. In such situations players have often been suspected of (and occasionally even admitted to) deliberately incurring a second booking in a tournament when the following game is of little importance, thus resetting their yellow card tally to zero for subsequent games (known as \"cleaning cards\"). However, while technically within the rules of competition, this is considered unsportsmanlike and UEFA have on occasion acted on such choices and have given additional fines and or suspensions to the players and managers involved. Sergio Ramos in 2019 picked up extra Champions League suspensions after publicly suggesting during interviews that a yellow card that he accrued was on purpose for card cleaning.[10][11][12]  In 2017 IFAB approved temporary dismissals (sin-bins) for cautionable offences similar to that seen in other sports; however, this is only permitted for youth, veterans, disability and grassroots football. Competitions' use of this system\u2014rather than normal yellow cards\u2014is optional, and there are variations in how it can be implemented. For 90-minute games, the length of the temporary dismissal is 10 minutes.[13]  A red card is shown by a referee to signify that a player must be sent off.[1]:\u200a38\u200a A player who has been sent off is required to leave the field of play immediately, must take no further part in the game and cannot be replaced by a substitute, forcing their team to play with one fewer player. If a team's goalkeeper receives a red card another player is required to assume goalkeeping duties, so teams usually substitute another goalkeeper for an outfield player if they still have substitutes available.  Law 12 of the Laws of the Game lists the categories of misconduct for which a player may be sent off. These are:  In matches using the Video Assistant Referee system, the list also includes entering the video operation room.[4]:\u200a105\u200a  Serious foul play is a foul committed using excessive force (i.e., \"the player has far exceeded the necessary use of force and is in danger of injuring his opponent when challenging for the ball and when it is in play.\").[1]:\u200a117\u200a Violent conduct is distinct from serious foul play in that it may be committed by any player, substitute, or substituted player against any person, e.g., teammates, match officials, or spectators.[1]:\u200a127\u200a  Once a player has been sent off, they are not permitted to stay in the team's technical area and must leave the immediate field or playing area.[14]  Should a team's on-field players receive a total of 5 red cards, it will be unable to field the required minimum of 7 players, resulting in the game being abandoned.  Starting in August 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic, IFAB and the Football Association stated that any player who deliberately coughs at others will receive a straight red card. Less severe incidents are classified as \"unsporting behaviour\" and will result in a yellow card.[15]  The practice of cautioning and excluding players who make serious breaches of the rules has been part of the Laws of the Game since 1881.[16] However, the practice of using language-neutral coloured cards to indicate these actions did not follow for almost 90 years.  The idea originated with British football referee Ken Aston.[6] Aston had been appointed to the FIFA Referees' Committee and was responsible for all referees at the 1966 FIFA World Cup. In the quarter finals, England met Argentina at Wembley Stadium. After the match, newspaper reports stated that referee Rudolf Kreitlein had cautioned both Bobby and Jack Charlton, as well as sending off Argentine Antonio Ratt\u00edn. The referee had not made his decision clear during the game, and England manager Alf Ramsey approached FIFA for post-match clarification. This incident started Aston thinking about ways to make a referee's decisions clearer to both players and spectators. Aston realised that a colour-coding scheme based on the same principle as used on traffic lights (yellow - caution, red - stop) would traverse language barriers and clarify whether a player had been cautioned or expelled.[6] As a result, yellow cards to indicate a caution and red cards to indicate an expulsion were used for the first time in the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico (though no players were sent off in that tournament). The use of penalty cards has since been adopted and expanded by several sporting codes, with each sport adapting the idea to its specific set of rules or laws.  Until 1992, a player committing a second bookable offence was shown only a red card; in that year, the IFAB mandated that a yellow card be shown before the red card.[17] Lothar Matth\u00e4us had previously proposed a \"lilac card\" to distinguish such cases from the more serious \"straight red card\" offence.[18]  With the help of the video assistant referee, it is now possible to upgrade a yellow card to a red card after an on-field review of the infraction. In that case, the referee will show the yellow card, make a no-good gesture, and show the red card to the offending player.  Fouls are very common occurrences in games. For example, the 2012\u201313 football season saw fouls-per-game rates in the major European leagues ranging from 23 in the Premier League to 32 in the Bundesliga.[19]  Yellow cards are less common, though a typical game will feature a few \u2013 at the 2014 FIFA World Cup there were, on average, about three cautions per game. Dismissals are much rarer; that same tournament saw an average of 0.2 red cards per match.[20]  The referee has a very large degree of discretion as to the enforcement of the 17 Laws including determining which acts constitute cautionable offences under the very broad categories. For this reason, refereeing decisions are sometimes controversial. Some Laws may specify circumstances under which a caution should or must be given, and numerous directives to referees also provide additional guidance. The encouragement for referees to use their common sense is known colloquially as \"Law 18\".[21]  According to the principle of advantage, play should be allowed to continue when an offence occurs and the non-offending team will benefit from ongoing play. If the anticipated advantage does not ensue within a few seconds, the referee will stop play and restart with a direct or indirect free kick or a penalty kick (depending on the offence).[22]  If the ball is out of play when an infraction of the Laws of the Game occurs, play is restarted according to the reason the ball became out of play before the infraction. (Any infraction of the Laws of the Game that occurs while the ball is out of play can be misconduct, but is not a foul.)  If the misconduct occurs when the ball is in play, play need not be stopped to administer a caution or a dismissal, as these may be done at the next stoppage of play (this is usually the case when the opposing team would gain an advantage in having play continue). When this is the case, play is restarted according to the reason for the ball becoming out of play, e.g. a throw-in if play stopped due to the ball crossing a touchline.  If play is stopped to administer a caution or dismissal:  In 2019 the IFAB approved the use of red and yellow cards for team officials and since then, in most competitions, the system operates in much the same way as the card system for players (i.e. if a team official, such as the manager or a coach, receives two yellow cards they are given a red). Depending on the seriousness of the offence, that official then may be subject to a subsequent touchline ban, a fine and\/or some other form of additional punishment - depending on the rules of their competition and national football association.    Up until this law change, team officials such as managers and coaches were originally not subject to the cautionable and sending-off offences listed above, as these apply only to players, substitutes, and substituted players. As such, they were not physically shown cards if they committed an offence. However, according to Law 5 the referee could caution or dismiss team officials from their technical areas and immediate surroundings (which was still sometimes colloquially referred to as a \"sending off\").  Many football leagues and federations impose off-field penalties for players who accumulate a certain number of cautions in a season, tournament or phase of a tournament. Typically, these take the form of suspending a player from playing in his team's next game(s) after reaching a particular number of cautions. Such off-field penalties are determined by league rules, and not by the Laws of the Game. A unique rule regarding this penalty was introduced by Major League Soccer in its reserve league of MLS Next Pro at the halfway point of Next Pro's inaugural 2022 season. A player who is sent off serves his suspension in his team's next match against the same opponent.[23]  Similarly, a direct red card usually also results in additional sanctions, most commonly in the form of suspensions from playing for a number of future games, although financial fines may also be imposed. The exact punishments are determined by tournament or competition rules, and not by the Laws of the Game. FIFA in particular has been adamant that a red card in any football competition must result in the guilty player being suspended for at least the next game, with the only grounds of appeal being mistaken identity.[24]  At the 2006 FIFA World Cup, any player receiving two yellow cards during the three group stage matches, or two yellow cards in the knockout stage matches had to serve a one-match suspension for the next game. A single yellow card did not carry over from the group stage to the knockout stages. Should the player pick up his second yellow during the team's final group match, he would miss the Round of 16 if his team qualified for it. However, suspensions due to yellow cards do not carry beyond the World Cup finals.  For the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the rules were changed so that any player who received two yellow cards between the beginning of the tournament and the end of the quarterfinal round (instead of the end of the group stage matches) would serve a one-match suspension for the next game. As a result, only players that received a red card (whether directly or after a second booking) in the semifinal game would not be able to play in the final.  In some league\/group competitions, a team's fair play record, as measured by the total number of yellow and red cards acquired by a team, may be used as a potential tie-breaking method to determine final table position. This method was used for the first time in the World Cup's history in 2018, where Japan advanced to the round of 16 over Senegal in Group H after being tied in every other category (Japan received four yellow cards in the group, fewer than Senegal's six).[25][26] "},{"title":"Down (gridiron football)","content":"A down is a period in which a play transpires in gridiron football. The down is a distinguishing characteristic of the game compared to other codes of football but is synonymous with the 6 \"tackle\" rule in rugby league. The team in possession of the football has a limited number of downs (four in American football, three in Canadian football) to advance ten yards or more towards their opponent's goal line. If they fail to advance that far, possession of the ball is turned over to the other team. In most situations if a team reaches their final down, they will punt to their opponent, which forces their opponent to begin their drive from further down the field; if they are in range, they might instead attempt to score a field goal.  A down begins with a snap or free kick (such as a kickoff or safety kick) and ends when the ball or the player in possession of it is declared down by an official, a team scores, or the ball or player in possession of it leaves the field of play.  The player with possession of the ball after he has been tackled or is otherwise unable to advance the ball further on account of the play having ended is down (e.g., \"He is down at the 34-yard line\").  Down may also refer to the ball after it is made dead in one manner or another.  The line of scrimmage for the next play will be determined by the position of the ball when it is down.  Each possession begins with first down.  The line to gain is marked 10 yards downfield from the start of this possession, and the situation is described as \"1st and 10\" (if the goal line is less than 10 yards downfield, then the goal line is the line to gain and the situation is \"1st and goal\").  If the offensive team moves the ball past the line to gain, they make a new first down.  If they fail to do this after a specified number of downs (four in American play and three in Canadian play), the team turns the ball over on downs, and possession of the ball reverts to the opposing team at the spot where the ball was downed at the end of the last down.  If a penalty against the defensive team moves the ball past the line to gain, the offensive team gets a new first down. Some defensive penalties give the offense an automatic first down regardless of the distance.  When the offensive team reaches the final down, the team faces a last down situation (third down situation in Canadian play and fourth down situation in American play), where the team must decide whether to use a running or passing play in an attempt to gain a first down (this is called going for it), or alternatively to kick the ball (either by punting or attempting a field goal). Though statistical analysis of games suggests playing more aggressively is the better option,[citation needed] kicking the ball is typically seen as the safer solution; scrimmaging may lead to a turnover on downs, potentially giving the ball over to the other team with good field position.  Downing the player with possession of the ball is one way to end a play (other ways include the player with the ball going out of bounds, an incomplete pass, or a score).  Usually a player is made down when he is tackled by the defense. In the NFL, if the offensive player is touching the ground with some part of his body other than his hands or feet, then he is down if any defensive player touches him. In the NCAA, an offensive player touching the ground in the same manner is down, regardless of whether a defensive player touches him.  If recovering the ball in one's opponent's end zone (following a kickoff in American football, and following any kick into the end zone, except for successful field goals, in Canadian football), a player may down the ball by dropping to one knee (in Canadian play, doing so scores a single for the opposing team).  A player in possession of the ball will down the ball if he fumbles it out of bounds.  If a quarterback is running with the ball during his initial possession following the snap, he may down the ball by doing a foot-first slide\u00a0\u2013  this is to protect the quarterback from injury.  In the NFL, the quarterback is the only player for whom falling down in this way automatically stops play.  The situation at a down can be described succinctly in a short phrase of the form 1st\/2nd\/3rd\/4th and X. The first part describes which down the offense is on, and the X is a number of yards between the current line of scrimmage and the line at which the offense would gain another set of downs. Thus, offenses will normally begin on 1st and 10. If they gain 5 yards on the play, the subsequent situation would be described as 2nd and 5.  If the distance to the target line is very small, the number of yards may be replaced by and inches (e.g. 3rd and inches). Colloquially, when the target line is far from the line of scrimmage, the term \"and long\" may be used (e.g. 3rd and long).  When the offense has a first down within 10 yards of the goal line, the goal line becomes the line to gain as they cannot make another first down (barring a defensive penalty) without actually scoring. In these situations the number of yards is replaced with and goal, e.g. 1st and goal.  Other downs-related terminology is as follows:  In modern rugby union football, teams have unlimited possession of the ball after a tackle usually a ruck will form.  In modern rugby league football, each team has six tackles to score. If they fail then possession changes over to the other team. The rule was established at four tackles in 1966 and was changed to six tackles at different times in different countries.  In American football, the concept of the act of having the ball down gave rise to \"down\" as the condition of the player so obligated, and the ball carrier could call for a \"down\" voluntarily. Although NCAA rules have effectively abolished this (as the ball carrier dropping to the ground immediately ends the play), other codes for North American football, such as the NFL, still allow (as one way for the ball to become dead) for the runner to cry \"down\".  Eventually the rules officially applied the word to include all of the action from the time the ball was put into play (whether by snap or free kick) until it became dead. However, in some contexts the down begins when the ball is made ready for play by the officials.  The system of downs, in terms of a set number of plays to advance the ball a certain number of yards, was introduced by the Intercollegiate Football Association in 1882. (Then-player Walter Camp, as secretary of the rules committee, chronicled this change, but had not promoted it.) It allowed a team three downs to advance the ball five yards, or retreat with it ten yards, or else lose possession of the ball, a proposal meant to reduce sandbagging. Early in the 20th century, after the forward pass was added to the game, the required advance was doubled to ten yards, and later a fourth down was added to the series; the alternative of retreating a distance with the ball had meanwhile doubled its requirement to twenty yards and later been abolished. A system of three downs was introduced to Canadian football around 1900 in certain provincial rules, as the game had not yet been standardized nationwide.  Three and out is a situation in American football in which a team, after starting an offensive possession, executes three plays, fails to get a first down, and then punts.  The term comes from the standard practice that an offensive unit only has three \"real\" plays before they are expected to punt. While, in theory, a team is allowed a fourth running or passing play, using the fourth down to run or pass is a risky move under most circumstances. If they fail to gain a new first down on a fourth-down play, the opposing team takes possession at the spot where they left off, giving them better field position than if the ball had been punted farther toward the opposing team's end zone. Typically, a team will run or pass on fourth down only if they are trailing late in a close game, are close enough to the first down marker (usually a yard or less) and in the opposing team's territory, or in a certain part of the field where a punt will likely result in a touchback (which will result in a relatively limited net gain of yardage), but just beyond the distance where a field goal is likely to be successful (in the NFL, a missed field goal results in the opposition taking possession at the spot of the unsuccessful kick) \u2013 the range at which American football coaches will typically attempt to convert fourth downs where they otherwise would not varies between the opponent's 30- and 45-yard lines, depending on such factors as the kicker's or punter's perceived abilities and the required distance to gain.  Punting following a three-and-out is unlike a turnover on downs.  Punting after a three-and-out allows a team the opportunity to set their opposition farther back in field position. On a turnover on downs, there is no punt and the opposing team takes over possession of the ball at the spot of field where the final (third in the Canadian game, fourth in the American game) down ended.  In Canadian football, since there are three downs, the term \"two and out\" is used in this situation. In the Canadian game, single points can be scored on punts and missed field goals. As a result, Canadian football coaches will never \"go for it\" simply on account of the ball being on the edge of field goal range \u2013 barring extraordinary circumstances (such as trailing by between four and eight points late in the game), teams facing third and relatively long at the edge of field goal range will typically either punt (typically with the intent of putting the ball out of bounds near the opposing goal line as opposed to actually scoring a single point) or attempt a field goal. "},{"title":"Comparison of rugby league and rugby union","content":"  The team sports rugby union and rugby league have shared origins and thus many similarities. Initially, following the 1895 split in rugby football, rugby union and rugby league differed in administration only. Soon, however, the rules of rugby league were modified, resulting in two distinctly different forms of rugby.   After 100 years, in 1995 rugby union joined rugby league and most other forms of football as an openly professional sport.[1]  The inherent similarities between rugby union and rugby league have at times led to the possibility of a merger of the two variants[2] and experimental hybrid games have been played that use a mix of the two sports' rules.[3]  Rugby union was originally referred to as rugby football. During the early development of rugby football different schools used different rules, on many occasions agreeing upon them shortly before commencement of the game.[4] In 1871, English clubs met to form the Rugby Football Union (RFU). Rugby football spread to Australia and New Zealand, with games being played in the early-to-mid-nineteenth century.[5]  In 1892, charges of professionalism were laid against Yorkshire clubs after they compensated players for missing work. A proposal to pay players up to six shillings when they missed work because of match commitments was voted down by the RFU. On 27 August 1895, prominent Lancashire clubs declared that they would support their Yorkshire colleagues in their proposal to form a professional organization and the Northern Rugby Football Union, usually called the Northern Union (NU), was formed.[6] The rugby union authorities issued sanctions against clubs, players and officials involved in the offshoot group, including amateurs who played with or against Northern Union sides. The RFU also banned any player that played rugby league from playing rugby union that lasted until 1995.[7] After the schism the separate codes were named \"rugby union\" for the RFU code and \"rugby league\" for the NU code.[8]  In 1906, All Black George William Smith joined with Albert Henry Baskerville to form a team of professional rugby players. George Smith cabled a friend in Sydney and three professional matches were arranged between a New South Wales rugby team before continuing onto the UK. This game was played under the rugby union laws and it was not until the team, nicknamed the All Golds, arrived in Leeds that they learnt the new Northern Union laws. Meanwhile, in Sydney a meeting was organised to look at forming a professional rugby competition in Australia. The meeting resolved that a \"New South Wales Rugby Football League\" (NSWRFL) should be formed, to play the Northern Union rules. The first season of the NSWRFL competition was played in 1908, and has continued to be played every year since.  During rugby league's 1921\u201322 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain, the Northern Rugby Football Union tried to arrange a match in Paris, but opposition from the Rugby Football Union-aligned French Rugby Federation made it impossible.[9] In France rugby league split from rugby union in the 1930s. In 1948 the French instigated the formation of the International Rugby League Board as the world governing body for rugby league. France, New Zealand, Britain and Australia (who joined a few months later) were the founding countries. The International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) had formed prior to the schism in 1886 and remained the international governing body for rugby union, although it originally only consisted of England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland. Australia, New Zealand and South Africa joined the IRFB in 1948, France in 1978 and Argentina, Canada, Italy and Japan in 1991.  On 26 August 1995 the IRFB, now known as World Rugby, declared rugby union an \"open\" game and thus removed all restrictions on payments or benefits to those connected with the game.[10] This came after rugby league accused rugby union of \"shamateurism\" to Inland Revenue in the UK and due to Kerry Packer signing top union players to professional contracts in secret for a breakaway union competition.[7][11] According to The New York Times at the time:  Thirteen-man rugby league has shown itself to be a faster, more open game of better athletes than the other code. Rugby union is trying to negotiate its own escape from amateurism, with some officials admitting that the game is too slow, the laws too convoluted to attract a larger TV following.[12]  Although both rugby codes are forms of football, in many places, it could cause confusion as \"football\" is understood to mean soccer, gridiron football, Gaelic football or Australian rules football depending on the country (or indeed region of the country). In much of the rugby union-playing world, the sport of rugby league is infrequently played and rugby union is commonly known simply as \"rugby\"; in countries where both codes are played, there is a need to distinguish between the codes of rugby.  In the United Kingdom, rugby union or rugby league fans rarely refer to their sport as \"football\" as in most cases this would refer to association football. Across the United Kingdom, rugby union is usually referred to simply as 'rugby' but in the North of England, the word 'rugby' could refer to either sport,[13][14] but usually means \"rugby league\". The nickname \"rugger\", which developed in England's elite schools, almost always refers to rugby union.[citation needed]  In Australia and New Zealand, rugby league is usually known as \"league\" or \"football\" with the latter term potentially confusing as Australian rules football and association football could also be called football. Rugby union is often simply referred to as \"rugby\" without the ambiguity that this term carries in the UK.  In France, rugby union is called rugby \u00e0 quinze (rugby with 15) or simply \"rugby\", whilst rugby league is known as rugby \u00e0 treize (rugby with 13) or jeu \u00e0 treize (game with 13).[15][16]  Since the 1895 schism, changes have taken place to the laws of both rugby union and rugby league football so that now they are distinct sports.[17] The laws of rugby league football have been gradually changed with the aim of creating a faster,[18] more spectator-friendly sport.[19] Player numbers were reduced to thirteen a side, creating more space for attacking play, and rucks and mauls were replaced with a play-the-ball restart.[20] Changes to the laws of rugby union have been less extreme, although there have been adjustments in scoring as the game became more try-orientated rather than focusing on goals.[21] In 2009, major law changes were implemented with the aim of making union simpler and more open.[22] Rugby league historian Tony Collins has written that since turning professional in the mid-1990s, rugby union has increasingly borrowed techniques and tactics from rugby league.[23][24]  Rugby union has more laws than rugby league[25][26] and it has been described as being a more complex game.[27][28] Rugby league in turn has been described as a simpler game that is easier for spectators to understand.[29] Mat Rogers, an Australian dual-code rugby international player, has said \"Rugby [union] is very complicated and rugby league is much more simple in comparison\". England's Chris Ashton, also a dual international, has said that union has \"more of a tactical side, more that can happen in a game\". Ireland's Tom Court has said \"Rugby Union is a complex game with certain closed skills like scrummaging and line-out lifting and rugby league requires a higher level of fitness to compete at the highest level\".[30]  The two forms of rugby share the same basic rules of the game and use a similar-shaped ovoid ball. The aim is to score more points through tries, conversions, penalty goals and drop goals than the opposition within the 80 minutes of play.  Goals are scored when the ball is kicked between the two posts and over the cross-bar, either during open play or as the result of a penalty. A try is scored when the ball is touched down on or beyond the defending team's goal-line. The try-scoring side is given the chance to score two additional points by kicking a conversion similar to a penalty goal attempt from a point along a line which is parallel to the sideline at the same distance from the sideline as the place where the try had been scored.  The ball can be taken forward in three ways\u2014by kicking, by a player running with it, or as the result of a set-piece. The ball can be passed from hand to hand between teammates in a backward or sideways direction; it may not be passed forwards although it can be kicked forwards. Dropping the ball in a forwards direction results in a scrum, a set-piece that restarts the game, except on the sixth tackle in league where the game restarts with a handover to the opposition.  Only the player holding the ball may be tackled. A rugby tackle is an attempt to bring the ball carrier to the ground or to stop his forward progress. Play restarts with the ball being transferred to another player.  The playing positions are divided into \"backs\"\u2014generally faster and more mobile who score most of the points, and the larger, stronger \"forwards\" who are involved in the more physical aspects of rugby and generally do more tackling.  A big difference in gameplay between the two games is that rugby league has shed from its laws several opportunities for possession to be contested that rugby union has retained: contesting the ball after the tackle, on the ground in rucks and through mauls.[31] When the ball goes into touch, possession in rugby union is contested through a line-out, while in rugby league a scrum restarts play. The lesser focus on contesting possession means there are fewer stoppages of play in rugby league,[32] with the ball typically in play for 50 out of the 80 minutes compared to around 35 for professional rugby union.[33] As the ball is in play more and there are fewer players (13 compared to 15) to cover the field it has been implied that rugby league is the more physically demanding sport.[34][35]  In union the attacking team can hold onto and use the ball for as long as they are able, while the opposition's aim is to take possession of the ball from them. In league each team can be tackled six times before handing over possession; moreover, the action stops after each successful tackle (i.e., the ball is not contested after a tackle). After being tackled five times, the attacking team will usually kick the ball either in an attacking kick or for territory. As the ball can only be contested during a one on one tackle in league there is less scope for a turnover to occur than in rugby union.[36] A study commissioned by the IRB found that between the years 2002 and 2004 possession was retained by the attacking team in 13 out of 14 tackles in rugby union.[36] Collins has argued that the six tackle rule in rugby league offers a more even distribution of possession despite fewer opportunities to contest it.[36] In both games the attacking team loses possession if they drop or pass the ball forward, which results in a scrum being awarded to the defending team.  In union possession can also be contested at line-outs (played after the ball has gone into touch) and scrums. In the same study it was found that the team with the ball at a scrum regained possession 90 per cent of the time, while the team with the ball at a lineout regained possession 80 per cent of the time.[36] League does not have a lineout, but does utilise a scrum to restart play. It is uncommon for modern rugby league scrums to be contested, with the side awarded the scrum almost always gaining possession.[37] Possession can also be contested following kicks to restart play from the halfway, 22 metre in both games (and from the goal line in league). Generally league restarts are likely to go for distance unless possession is needed quickly (usually if a team is behind with very little time left to play).[38] Union restarts are more likely to be short to allow players to contest possession in the air.[39]  Possession may change the same ways in both games:  Possession may change in rugby league in a number of unique ways:  Possession may change in rugby union in a number of unique ways  In both games tackling is permitted to either bring down the player in possession of the ball or prevent him from making forward progress. Tackling or interfering with a player who is not in possession of the ball is not permitted. Tripping with the leg is not allowed in either code. However, in rugby league, if a tackling player has both hands on the ball carrier, he is allowed to use his legs to bring him to ground.  In rugby league, a tackle is deemed to be complete when the elbow of the arm holding the ball touches the ground, or the player is held in an upright tackle. The ball cannot be further advanced and a play-the-ball or handover must take place. In rugby union, a tackle is deemed to be complete when the player in possession is held on the ground; that player must play the ball (either releasing it, passing it, or if over the try line grounding the ball) immediately. In rugby league a play the ball takes place after each tackle. In rugby union, play does not stop when a player is forced to the ground in a tackle, as the tackled player must immediately play the ball, and the tackler must roll away, which will generally mean a ruck will form.  The laws of rugby league specifically outlaw the so-called \"voluntary tackle\": players are not allowed to go to ground unless they are effectively tackled by an opponent, though in practice this rule is rarely applied. There was no equivalent law in rugby union, in the past going to ground with the ball and protecting it was practised, but in the modern game deliberately falling on the ground to gain an advantage is outlawed by Law 14: \"The game is to be played by players who are on their feet. A player must not make the ball unplayable by falling down.\" A player who falls to ground with the ball or on it must immediately release or pass the ball, or get up with it.  Union and league have the same ways of scoring, but there are significant differences in the points awarded, and a few minor differences in the laws governing the scoring of tries.  The try is the main way of scoring in both codes; there are some subtle differences between the two codes, but the most obvious difference is that a try is worth 5 points in rugby union and 4 points in rugby league. In both games, a conversion following a try is worth 2 points. A player tackled just short of the try-line in rugby union can legitimately reach across it and place the ball down for a try. This is not allowed in rugby league unless the momentum of the player continues to take him over the line in one continuous movement. If the tackle is complete, such a move would constitute a \"double movement\" and the try would be disallowed.  A drop goal is worth 3 points in union and 1 in league. A penalty goal is worth 3 points in union and 2 points in league. Due to the increased prevalence of infringements during contesting of the ball, penalties are a much more common occurrence in union than in league. This, combined with the higher number of points with a successful penalty conversion, results in penalties forming a considerably higher percentage of total points in a match of Rugby Union.  Use of a penalty box (or \"sin bin\") was introduced by rugby league in 1980.[40] Rugby union had been experimenting with the same concept since 1979,[41] although it was not formally sanctioned until 2001.[42]  Video referee technology was first used for rugby league in 1996[43] and for rugby union in 2001.[42]  In rugby league the ball may be thrown or knocked out of play deliberately, while in union those are penalty offences. Kicking the ball out of play is legal in both codes.  When taking free or penalty kicks with a \"tap and go\" option, rugby league permits a stylised kick with the ball being tapped against the foot or lower leg while union requires the ball to leave the hands of the kicker. This difference in emphasis on a relatively trivial phase of play can be seen as indicative of the core differences between the games. In league, the kick is stylised as its purpose is to restart the game and to move to the run and tackle main play as quickly as possible. In union, where every phase of play has some element of competition, the trivial need to release the ball at any kick can result in a fumble that may give the opposition a chance to either contest possession or, if \"knocked-on\", will cause them to be awarded a scrum.  A rugby league pitch is between 112 and 122 metres long by 68 metres wide. The distance between try-lines is always 100 metres. There are lines going across the field which mark every ten metres. An in-goal area extends six to eleven metres beyond each goal line. At the goal line is a set of goal posts in the shape of the letter 'H', used for other forms of point scoring: drop goal, penalty and conversion.  A rugby union pitch is between 106 and 144 metres long by 68 to 70 metres wide. The length from try line to try line varies between 94 and 100 metres, with a distance of 6 to 22 metres between the goal and dead-ball lines. Lines are painted at the dead-ball line, goal line, 22-metre line, 10-metre line (broken line) and halfway. Lines are also located 5 metres away from the goal line and touchline and 15 metres away from the touchline. At the goal line is a set of goal posts in the shape of the letter 'H', used for other forms of point scoring: drop goal, penalty and conversion.   The dimensions of a rugby league pitch fit within the parameters of a rugby union pitch. Since World Rugby allowed professionalism in 1995, it has been possible for clubs to share facilities, including pitches. One such example was Leeds Rhinos and Yorkshire Carnegie, both part of the Leeds Rugby group, who shared Headingley Stadium. A maximum of 15 players can play rugby union at any one time whereas rugby league permits 13 players. In both games, the positions are divided into \"backs\" and \"forwards\".  Many of the positions have similar names but in practice are very different. The position known as 'flanker' is not in rugby league; however the second row in rugby league are loose like the flankers in rugby union while the lock \/ loose forward in rugby league is similar to the number 8 in rugby union. In the backs, rugby league centres are split into left and right centre rather than inside and outside centres.  The reduction in the importance of the scrum and the removal of the line-out from rugby league, has meant it is a faster free flowing game. Very different skill sets and body types needed for the different positions has become more obvious as union players specialise more.[44] For instance, props and hookers in rugby union tend to be among the physically strongest and heaviest players with high levels of scrummaging and mauling skills, but traditionally with limited speed and ball-handling skills. In rugby league, props are physically big, straight running forwards whose job it is to set the platform and get the go forward while still possessing agility and good ball handling skills. Locks in union tend to be very tall and high jumpers, as this helps at line-outs; while as this is not a necessity for league; the two second rowers and the loose forward \/ lock are mobile with speed across the park who can off-load on attack and contain and enforce on defence. They are similar to the loose forward trio of flankers and number eight in rugby union. Depending on their speed and ball playing skills, lock forwards in rugby league can generally play as both a forward and as an extra five-eight.  Scrum-half is a specialized position in rugby union and similar to the hooker in league: the number 9 initiates most moves by his or her team and must be an excellent passer of the ball in rugby union as with league. In rugby league any player can act from dummy half, however, in the professional modern game it is a specialised job for the hooker to instigate and direct the forward platform. He must also be able to probe with a running and varied kicking game from dummy half while still possessing strong and effective tackling.  The similarity between the two games has meant that players can switch between the two codes. League initially recruited big name players from union, like Herbert \"Dally\" Messenger in 1907,[45] and the RFU responded by banning any player that played rugby league for life.[46] A push into converting union players to rugby league, such as All Blacks John Gallagher, Frano Botica, Matthew Ridge and Va'aiga Tuigamala, occurred during the late 1980s and into the 1990s.[47] When rugby union became professional league players were allowed to play for rugby union teams, leading to a reversal in cross-code switching. Gallagher, Botica and Tuigamala returned to union, while leading league players such as Jason Robinson, Wendell Sailor, Mat Rogers, Lote Tuqiri, Henry Paul and Iestyn Harris, took up rugby union contracts.[47] Sailor, Rogers, Tuqiri, Paul and Harris subsequently switched back to rugby league. Players who play international rugby in both codes are known as dual-code internationals.  In 1909, when the new \"Northern Union\" code was still in its infancy, a match between the Kangaroos and the Wallabies was played before a crowd of around 20,000, with the rugby league side winning, 29\u201326.[48] With the wartime Emergency League suspended, Leeds Rugby League reverted to rugby union during World War I to play a one-off challenge game against the Royal Navy Depot from Plymouth in 1917. This was precursor to the following Christmas when two Challenge games were organised between the two sides but this time with one of each code. The Navy won the union game, 9\u20133, on Christmas Eve but proved equally adept at league recording a 24\u20133 win on 28 December. During World War II, the RFU relaxed its restrictions on rugby league footballers playing rugby union. In 1943, a Northern Command army rugby league side defeated a Northern Command union side, 18\u201311, at Headingley under rugby union laws. The following year a Combined Services rugby league side beat a Combined Services union side, 15\u201310, at Bradford again at rugby union. These were the only league v union matches played until 1996.[49]  With both sports becoming professional matches between union and league teams have been played. In May 1996, Bath Rugby and Wigan RLFC, who were then England's top union and league sides respectively, made history by playing against each other at both codes of rugby. Wigan won, 82\u20136, in the first match, played under league rules, and lost the second, 44\u201319, under union rules. Since then other games have been played between union and league teams using the laws of one of the codes, or in some cases using a different set of laws for each half.  Since the two match series in 1996, there has only been one similar endeavour to bring together union and league. In January 2003, St Helens rugby league took on Sale rugby union in a single game played at Knowsley Road, intended to have one half under league rules and the other under union rules. Unlike Bath, who were to all intents and purposes still the amateur side they had been, Sale had the benefit of almost a decade of professionalism to improve both strength and fitness that was necessary for them to adapt to the constant tackling required in rugby league. Sale prevailed against St Helens in front of a fierce St Helens home crowd at Knowsley Road, winning the match 41\u201339.[50]  Traditionally, the two rugbys have been seen as divided along class lines, with union associated more with the middle class, and league with the working class.[51] One of the main reasons for the split was union's enforcement of the amateur principle, meaning that working class players could not afford to take time off work to play the sport.[52]  In England, rugby union is widely regarded as an \"establishment\" sport, played mostly by members of the upper and middle classes. For example, many students at public schools play rugby union.[53] In contrast, rugby league has traditionally been seen as a working class pursuit.  In Wales, rugby union is associated with small village teams which consisted of coal miners and other industrial workers playing on their days off.[54]  In Australia, the two codes were also strongly divided down class lines.[55] Support for both codes is concentrated in New South Wales, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory. The same perceived class barrier as exists between the two games in England also occurs in these states, fostered by rugby union's prominence and support at private schools.[56]  In New Zealand, rugby union is played throughout the whole country where as rugby league is still considered to be a lower class game by many, or a game for \"westies\" referring to lower class western suburbs of Auckland and more recently the poorer southern Auckland where the game is popular. [citation needed]  In France, rugby union is widely played and has a strong tradition in the Basque, Occitan, and Catalan areas [citation needed] along the border regions between Spain and France. It rivals the popularity of association football. Rugby league has historically been played in much the same region. [citation needed]  The balls for rugby are very similar, both a prolate spheroid shaped ball. Rugby league balls are similar in size to Rugby union balls, but are more pointed at the edges. Rugby balls are noticeably larger than a Canadian \/ American football, and do not have ties for grabbing.[citation needed] Rather than being made of coarse leather as in gridiron, rugby balls are made with a smoother synthetic finish.[citation needed]  In the UK, the \"two codes\" of rugby are very different in scale and turnover. The turnover of the RFL was reported as \u00a319m in 2014.[57] For comparison, the turnover of the Rugby Football Union in 2014 was \u00a3150m.[58] The number of rugby union players in England is 1.99 million (predominantly school and children's teams following a RFU drive to increase participation) but which includes 131,000 senior male players.[59] The number of players participating in any capacity in Rugby League in England (including wheelchair users) is about 100,000.[60]  In Australia, rugby league had 1,430,367 participants in the sport (including school clinics) and 167,533 registered players in 2021.[61] The Australian Rugby League Commission reported a gross revenue of $185,668,873 and a gross profit of $14,675,845 in the 2022 financial year.[62] Rugby Union in 2012 had 323,115 participants, including 50,000 registered juniors.[63] The ARU in 2012 had gross revenues of $96.6m, but had a net deficit of $8.3m. A significant portion of Rugby Union's revenue is derived from the national team touring overseas and visiting tours, while Rugby League's is largely generated by its strong domestic league.  The number of rugby union players in New Zealand is estimated to be 129,000, with 95,721[61] playing rugby league.  Rugby union generally has a broader reach around the world, largely due to the unrestricted spread of the game across commonwealth countries, promulgated by British armed forces, during a time when the armed forces banned rugby league in the early 20th century.[64] For example, it is a popular sport in a number of countries such as South Africa and Argentina.  The oldest international rugby union competition is the Six Nations Championship, the men\u2019s version, starting in 1883 with games played between England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland. France joined in 1910 and Italy in 2000. The women\u2019s version of the Six Nations Championship was inaugurated, 2 years after the men\u2019s version. In 1996 the Southern Hemisphere teams of South Africa, Australia and New Zealand started their own annual international competition known as the Tri Nations; it adopted its current name of The Rugby Championship when Argentina joined in 2012.  Rugby union was previously a medal sport at four Olympic games, in Paris (1900 and 1924), London (1908) and Antwerp (1920), and returned to the Olympics in 2016[65] in the sevens form. Rugby union sevens is a core event at both the Commonwealth Games and the Asian Games.  The major annual international competition in rugby league is the Four Nations, first played in 1999. It originally involved Britain, Australia and New Zealand before expanding to include a fourth invited nation in 2009.  Rugby league introduced its World Cup for men in 1954 and it has been held intermittently since, in various formats, Great Britain won the inaugural men\u2019s version of the Rugby League World Cup, while the women\u2019s version of the Rugby League World Cup was first played in 2000 and New Zealand won the inaugural women\u2019s version of the Rugby League World Cup.  Rugby union's first World Cup for men was held in 1987 and both are contested every four years, New Zealand won the inaugural men\u2019s version of the Rugby Union World Cup. The women\u2019s version of the Rugby Union World Cup was first played in 1991, which are held every four years alternating with the men\u2019s version, to avoid clashing with other sporting events: Rugby 7s at both the Commonwealth Games and the Summer Olympics. The United States won the inaugural women\u2019s version of the Rugby Union World Cup.  There is a newer version of the Rugby League tournament, which is known as the Rugby League Nines. The inaugural Rugby League Nines World Cup was launched in 2019. Australia won the men\u2019s version of the Rugby League Nines World Cup while New Zealand won the women\u2019s version. "},{"title":"Gaelic football","content":"  Gaelic football (Irish: Peil Ghaelach; short name Peil,[1] Ulster Scots: Gaelic fitbaw), commonly known as simply Gaelic, GAA[2] or Football is an Irish team sport. A form of football, it is played between two teams of 15 players on a rectangular grass pitch. The objective of the sport is to score by kicking or punching the ball into the other team's goal (3 points) or between two upright posts above the goal and over a crossbar 2.5 metres (8\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in) above the ground (1 point).  Players advance the football up the field with a combination of carrying, bouncing, kicking, hand-passing, and soloing (dropping the ball and then toe-kicking the ball upward into the hands). In the game, two types of scores are possible: points and goals. A point is awarded for kicking or hand-passing the ball over the crossbar, signalled by the umpire raising a white flag. A goal is awarded for kicking the ball under the crossbar into the net (the ball cannot be hand-passed into the goal), signalled by the umpire raising a green flag. Positions in Gaelic football are similar to those in other football codes and comprise one goalkeeper, six backs, two midfielders, and six forwards, with a variable number of substitutes.  Gaelic football is one of four sports (collectively referred to as the \"Gaelic games\") controlled by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), the largest sporting organisation in Ireland. Along with hurling and camogie, Gaelic football is one of the few remaining strictly amateur sports in the world, with players, coaches, and managers prohibited from receiving any form of payment. Gaelic football is mainly played on the island of Ireland, although units of the Association exist in Great Britain, mainland Europe, North America, Africa, Asia and Oceania.  The final of the All-Ireland Senior Championship, held every year at Croke Park, Dublin, draws crowds of more than 80,000 people. Outside Ireland, football is mainly played among members of the Irish diaspora. A notable exception is France, where it has been growing lately, not least in the Celtic region of Brittany.[3] Gaelic Park in New York City is the largest purpose-built Gaelic sports venue outside Ireland. Three major football competitions operate throughout the year: the National Football League and the All-Ireland Senior Championship operate on an inter-county basis, while the All-Ireland Club Championship is contested by individual clubs. The All-Ireland Senior Championship is considered the most prestigious event in Gaelic football.  Under the auspices of the GAA, Gaelic football is a male-only sport; however, the related sport of ladies' Gaelic football is governed by the Ladies' Gaelic Football Association.   Similarities between Gaelic football and Australian rules football have allowed the development of international rules football, a hybrid sport, and a series of Test matches has been held regularly since 1998.  While Gaelic football as it is known today dates back to the late 19th century, various kinds of football were played in Ireland before this time.  The first legal reference to football in Ireland was in 1308, when John McCrocan, a spectator at a football game at Novum Castrum de Leuan (the New Castle of the Lyons or Newcastle), was charged with accidentally stabbing a player named William Bernard. A field near Newcastle, South Dublin is still known as the football field.[4][5][6][7] The Statute of Galway of 1527 allowed the playing of \"foot balle\" and archery but banned \"'hokie'\u2014the hurling of a little ball with sticks or staves\" as well as other sports.  By the 17th century, the situation had changed considerably. The games had grown in popularity and were widely played.[8] This was due to the patronage of the gentry.[9][citation needed] Now instead of opposing the games it was the gentry and the ruling class who were serving as patrons of the games. Games were organised between landlords with each team comprising 20 or more tenants. Wagers were commonplace with purses of up to 100 guineas (Prior, 1997).  The earliest record of a recognised precursor to the modern game dates from a match in County Meath in 1670, in which catching and kicking the ball were permitted.[8]  However even \"foot-ball\" was banned[10] by the severe Sunday Observance Act of 1695, which imposed a fine of one shilling (a substantial amount at the time) for those caught playing sports. It proved difficult, if not impossible, for the authorities to enforce the Act and the earliest recorded inter-county match in Ireland was one between Louth and Meath, at Slane, in 1712, about which the poet James Dall McCuairt wrote a poem of 88 verses beginning \"Ba haigeanta\".  A six-a-side version was played in Dublin in the early 18th century, and 100 years later there were accounts of games played between County sides (Prior, 1997).  By the early 19th century, various football games, referred to collectively as caid, were popular in County Kerry, especially the Dingle Peninsula. Father W. Ferris described two forms of caid: the \"field game\" in which the object was to put the ball through arch-like goals, formed from the boughs of two trees, and; the epic \"cross-country game\", which lasted the whole of a Sunday (after mass) and was won by taking the ball across a parish boundary. \"Wrestling\", \"holding\" opposing players, and carrying the ball were all allowed.  Some accounts of traditional Irish football come not from Ireland, but from the Irish diaspora, often in celebrating traditional events such as St Patrick's Day. The largest such communities existed in Britain, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. Many of the earliest football matches in Australia date back to the 1840s amongst Irish immigrants. In the Colony of South Australia, there are several accounts of Irish football being played at Thebarton in 1843 and again in 1853.[11] There were similar accounts of football in the 1840s in the Colony of Victoria including Melbourne at Batman's Hill[12][13] and the goldfields in the Colony of Victoria. The account of H C A Harrison, one of the seminal in the history of Victorian football, of Irish rules was that it gave players \"the full ability to kick anybody that came within reach\".[14] Shin-kicking (or hacking) was a major feature of traditional Irish football and also one of the main reasons why it failed to be widely adopted in Australia.[15] Irish football was also played in the Colony of New Zealand in the 1860s[16] and 1870s in Auckland during Thomas Croke's term as Archbishop there. An 1882 theatrical performance in New York portrays a controversial Irish football match on Saint Nicholas Day 6 December 1790 at the school of Champs de Mars in Paris.[17] Despite a large Irish population references to it being played in America before the 1880s are scant. USGAA makes the unsourced claim that matches were played at Hyde Park, San Francisco in the 1850s.  During the 1860s and 1870s, rugby football started to become popular in Ireland. Trinity College Dublin was an early stronghold of rugby, and the rules of the (English) Football Association were codified in 1863 and distributed widely. By this time, according to Gaelic football historian Jack Mahon, even in the Irish countryside, caid had begun to give way to a \"rough-and-tumble game\", which even allowed tripping.  The first account of what the founders of modern Gaelic football referred to as Irish football dates to 1873. Paddy Begley notes that in County Kerry in 1870 only soccer and rugby were played, although historian Paddy Foley notes that by 1874 a third, very different form of football began to emerge and spread across South-West Ireland. At Killarney, these highly popular matches were virtually indistinguishable from the Victorian Rules (first codified in 1859 and then played extensively in the Colony of Victoria and Colony of Queensland and to a lesser extent in the colonies of New South Wales and New Zealand). This kicking variety of football was even played with an oval ball which became customary in Australia in the 1870s and that scoring was achieved only by kicking goals.[18] A major difference between the two styles is that the Irish variety featured high kicking \"up and under\" whereas in colonial Victoria, the little marks or foot passes were much more common.[19] While the founders of the game were all familiar with or played rugby, including Cusack and Davin, few had played Irish football as it was so rare outside of the South-West, though the influence of this football on the founders was obvious, this is most likely the \"football kicking under the Irish rules\" that Thomas Croke later recalled in County Cork.[18]  Irish football is a great game and worth going a long way to see when played on a fairly laid out ground and under proper rules. Many old people say just hurling exceeded it as a trial of men. I would not care to see either game now as the rules stand at present. I may say there are no rules and therefore those games are often dangerous.  Maurice Davin, 1884[18] Irish historian Garnham, citing R.M. Peter's Irish Football Annual of 1880, argued that Gaelic football did not exist before the 1880s and curious about the origin of the distinctive features believed that clubs from England in 1868 most likely introduced elements of their codes including the \"mark\" (a free kick to players who cleanly catch the ball, which was a feature of the matches played in the 1880s), lack of offside and scoring by kicking between the upright posts. Unable to identify the source of these peculiar traits he concluded that they must have been introduced by Trinity, Cambridge (those known as the 1858 Cambridge Rules) and Blackheath (1862 club rules).[20]  County Limerick was a stronghold of the game in the 1880s, and the Commercials Club in Limerick, founded by employees of Cannock's Drapery Store, was one of the first to impose a set of rules, which was adapted by other clubs in the city.[8] These rules are believed to be the basis for the rules that were later adopted by the GAA and appear to have contained some of the Victorian Rules of 1866. It is not known how or when these Victorian Rules reached Ireland, though many of the goldrush Irish immigrants returned to Ireland during the 1870s and 1880s as the colonial fortunes faded. At a similar point in time, the same football rules were proposed as an alternative to those of soccer and rugby in northern England[21] but did not take root there. Playing the code under its own rules the club (representing County Limerick) later won the inaugural 1887 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final.  English (Association) football started to take hold, especially in Ulster, in the 1880s. By the mid-1880s it had become so popular that it was feared by many to completely displace Irish football.  Ball-playing, hurling, football kicking, according to Irish rules, 'casting', leaping in various ways, wrestling, handy-grips, top-pegging, leap-frog, rounders, tip-in-the-hat, and all such favourite exercises and amusements amongst men and boys, may now be said to be not only dead and buried, but in several localities to be entirely forgotten and unknown.  Thomas Croke, 1884 letter to Michael Cusack[22] Irish football, however, continued its grip on the southern counties. Accounts from 1889 state that the variety of football that was becoming popular in Ireland in 1884 bore little resemblance at all to the old mob football and was received by the public as more a hybrid of English and Scotch football.[23]  Irish forms of football were not formally arranged into an organised playing code by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) until 1884 with the rules widely distributed in 1887. The GAA sought to promote traditional Irish sports, such as hurling, and to reject \"foreign\" (particularly English) imports. The first Gaelic football rules, showing the influence of hurling (and incorporating some of the Victorian Rules of 1866 and 1877[24][25][26]) represented the strong desire to differentiate from association football (and rugby)\u2014for example in their lack of an offside rule. The rules were first drawn up by Maurice Davin in 1884 and later published in the United Ireland magazine on 7 February 1887. The original rules bear many similarities to modern football with the requirement to kick, handpass, and the basic scoring system, however, the original rules also included many Australian features including additional scoring posts (removed later in 1910[18]). The code had already begun to diverge, with the mark being deprecated, the soccer ball being adopted,[27] and carrying the ball not allowed, as such there was no requirement to bounce or solo the ball[28] carrying the ball remained illegal until the turn of the 20th century. The game was intended to promote peace and harmony, rejecting the violence of other football codes, and Davin even included a requirement for players to hold hands with their opponents[29] though this practice fell out of favour.  The first game of Gaelic football under GAA rules (developed by Maurice Davin) was played near Callan, Co Kilkenny in February 1885.[30] From 1886 the GAA banned tackling.[31]  The widely published GAA rules were as follows:  1. The ground for full teams (21 aside) shall be 140 yards long by 84 yards broad, or as near that size as can be got. The ground must be properly marked by boundary lines. Boundary lines are to be at least five yards from the fences. Note\u2014 There is no objection to a larger ground.  2. There shall not be less than 14 or more than 21 players a side in regular matches.  3. There shall be two umpires and a referee. Where the umpires disagree the referee's decision shall be final. There shall also be a goal umpire at each end of the ground to watch for goals and points. The referee shall keep the time, and throw up the ball at the commencement of each goal.  4. The goalposts shall stand at each end in the centre of the goal line. They shall be 21 feet apart, with a crossbar 8 feet from the ground. Besides the goal posts, there shall be two upright posts standing in each goal line 21 feet from the goal posts. A goal is won when the ball is driven between the goalposts and under the crossbar. A point is counted when the ball is driven over the crossbar, or the goal line, within 21 feet of either goal post.  5. The captains of the teams shall toss for choice of sides before commencing play, and the players shall stand in two ranks opposite each other in the centre of the field until the ball is thrown up, each holding the hand of one of the other side.  6. Pushing or tripping behind, holding from behind, catching below knees, or butting with the head, shall be deemed foul, and the player so offending shall be ordered to stand aside for such time as the referee may think fit, and his side cannot substitute another man. Wrestling shall not be allowed.  7. The time of actual play shall be one hour, and sides are to be changed only at half-time.  8. When a player drives the ball over the sideline, it shall be thrown back from the point where it first crossed the line by a player on the opposite side. It may be thrown in any direction. When the ball is driven over the goal line, and not through the goal, the goalkeeper shall have a free kick from the goal, and no player on the opposite side to approach nearer than the 21-yard line until the ball is kicked. If the ball is driven over the goal line by a player whose goal line it is, it shall count one point for the opposite side; if driven over the goal line within 21 feet of either goal post, it shall count three points; if through the goal it shall count a goal.  9. The match shall be decided by the greater number of goals. When no goal is made, or when the goals are even, it shall be decided by the greater number of points.  10. The ball must be struck with the hand. It may be caught when off the ground, and the player catching it may kick it any way he pleases, but must not carry it or throw it forward. Note. \u2014 There is nothing in this rule to prevent a player from throwing the ball a little in front to allow himself more freedom in kicking it.  11. Where the rules are broken the referee may allow a free kick if he thinks fit. In such a free kick the ball must be kicked from the ground. No player on the opposite side is to approach nearer than 14 yards until the ball is kicked; but if the free kick is allowed nearer than 14 yards of the goal line, the opposite players need not stand behind that line.  12. If the ball strikes a bystander near the sideline, except the referee or umpire, it shall be considered out of play and must be thrown in as directed in Rule 8. If it occurs near the goal line it shall be considered out of play and must be kicked from the goal. In the latter case, the referee may allow one point or more if he thinks fit.  13. The referee shall have, during the match, full power to disqualify any player or order him to stand aside and discontinue play, for any act he may consider unfair, as set out in Rule 6, or for vicious play.  No nails or iron tips are allowed on the boots. Strips of leather fastened on the soles will prevent slipping. The dress for hurling and football is to be knee breeches and stockings and shoes or boots.  Gaelic football spread throughout the world in the late 19th century. Despite a huge Irish American population there was limited awareness of the game in America, though there was limited knowledge of its rules, apart from that the ball cannot be lifted from the ground by hand, and throttling is banned.[32]  It was first played in North America in the 1890s with games being played in both Canada and the United States in 1892.[33] More than a dozen clubs had been established in the US by 1893.[34] The first clubs appeared in England in 1896.  Around 1900 the game began to resemble more closely to the running game of today, players were able to lift the ball off the ground and run and carry it if they bounced it every 4 yards.  The first match played in Australia was in 1902 finding a niche in Queensland during a period when Australian football there was in recess.[35][36]  Some Gaelic Athletic Associations began to impose strict nationalistic policies during this time. For example, in Connacht free kicks began to be introduced into some leagues penalising speaking of any language but Irish, and imposing a rule that the referee may speak only in Irish.[37]  On Bloody Sunday in 1920, during the Irish War of Independence, a football match at Croke Park was attacked by the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC), including its Auxiliary Division. 14 people were killed and 65 were injured. Among the dead was Tipperary footballer Michael Hogan, for whom the Hogan Stand at Croke Park (completed in 1924) was named.[38][39]  In 1930 the GAA banned children found playing rugby instead of Gaelic football.[40][41]  In 1939, at Yankee Stadium in New York City, Kerry played Galway in front of a crowd of 70,000 spectators.[42]  By 1958, Wembley Stadium hosted annual exhibition games of Gaelic football in England, before tens of thousands of spectators.[43]  Ladies' Gaelic football has become increasingly popular with women since the 1970s.[citation needed]  In 1967, Australian journalist, broadcaster, and VFL umpire Harry Beitzel, inspired by watching the 1966 All-Ireland senior football final on television, sent an Australian team known as the \"Galahs\" including South Melbourne's Bob Skilton, Richmond's Royce Hart, Carlton's Alex Jesaulenko and Melbourne and Carlton legend Ron Barassi as captain-coach \u2013 to play against Mayo and All-Ireland champions Meath, which was the first recorded major interaction between the two codes.  What then followed is the current International Rules Series between players of both codes and utilizing rules from both codes, which also gives them a chance to represent their country. The GAA chooses the team to represent Ireland, while the AFL chooses the team to represent Australia and has added a stipulation that each member of their team must have been named an All-Australian at least once. The two countries take turns hosting the series, and both countries' and sports' respective most prestigious venues \u2013 Croke Park and the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) \u2013 have hosted series Tests. What is known as the Irish experiment also occurred, with Australian rules football clubs recruiting Gaelic football players. Irishmen who have distinguished themselves in both codes include Dublin's Jim Stynes \u2013 a 1984 minor All-Ireland football champion who became the 1991 Brownlow Medallist, a recipient of the Medal of the Order of Australia and a member of Melbourne's Team of the Century \u2013 and Kerry's Tadhg Kennelly, the first man to become both a senior All-Ireland football champion (2009) and an AFL Premiership player (2005 with Sydney, the Swans' first flag in 72 years).  Players advance the football up the field with a combination of carrying, bouncing, kicking, hand-passing, and soloing (dropping the ball and then toe-kicking it upward into the hands). In the game, two types of scores are possible: points and goals. A point is awarded for kicking or hand-passing the ball over the crossbar, signalled by the umpire raising a white flag. A goal is awarded for kicking the ball under the crossbar into the net, signalled by the umpire raising a green flag. Positions in Gaelic football are similar to those in other football codes and comprise one goalkeeper, six backs, two midfielders, and six forwards, with a variable number of substitutes.  A Gaelic pitch is similar in some respects to a rugby pitch but larger. The grass pitch is rectangular, stretching 130\u2013145 metres (142\u2013159 yards) long and 80\u201390\u00a0m (87\u201398\u00a0yd) wide. There are H-shaped goalposts at each end, formed by two posts, which are usually 6\u20137 metres (20\u201323 feet) high, set 6.5\u00a0m (21\u00a0ft) apart, and connected 2.5\u00a0m (8\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in) above the ground by a crossbar. A net extending behind the goal is attached to the crossbar and lower goalposts. The same pitch is used for hurling; the GAA, which organises both sports, decided this to facilitate dual usage. Lines are marked at distances of 13 metres (14\u00a0yd), 20 metres (22\u00a0yd), and 45 metres (49\u00a0yd) (65 metres or 71 yards in hurling) from each end-line. Shorter pitches and smaller goals are used by youth teams.[44]  The majority of adult football and all minor and under-21 matches last for 60 minutes, divided into two halves of 30 minutes, except for senior inter-county games, which last for 70 minutes (two halves of 35 minutes). Draws are decided by replays or by playing 20 minutes of extra time (two halves of 10 minutes). Juniors have halves of 20 minutes or 25 minutes in some cases. Half-time intermission lasts from 5 to 15 minutes. Championship matches have a 30-minute intermission.  Teams consist of fifteen players[45] (a goalkeeper, two corner backs, a full back, two wing backs, a centre back, two midfielders, two wing forwards, a centre forward, two corner forwards and a full forward) plus up to fifteen substitutes, of which six may be used. As for younger teams or teams that do not have enough players for fifteen a side, it is not uncommon to play thirteen a side (the same positions except without the full-back and the full forward). Each player is numbered 1\u201315, starting with the goalkeeper, who must wear a jersey colour different from that of his or her teammates. Up to 15 substitutes may be named on the team sheet, number 16 usually being the reserve goalkeeper.  The game is played with a round leather football made of 18 stitched leather panels, with a circumference of 68\u201370\u00a0cm (27\u201327+1\u20442\u00a0in), weighing between 480 and 500\u00a0g (16+7\u20448 and 17+5\u20448\u00a0oz) when dry.[46] It may be kicked or hand-passed. A hand pass is not a punch but rather a strike of the ball with the side of the closed fist, using the knuckle of the thumb.  In 2017, the GAA introduced the 'mark' across the board in Gaelic football. Similar to the mark in Australian rules football, a player who catches the ball from a kick-out is awarded a free kick. The rule in full states: \"When a player catches the ball cleanly from a Kick-Out without it touching the ground, on or past the 45-metre (49\u00a0yd) line nearest the Kick-Out point, he shall be awarded 'a Mark' by the Referee. The player awarded a 'Mark' shall have the options of (a) Taking a free kick or (b) Playing on immediately.\"[47] In comparison, the Australian rules equivalent requires the ball not to have touched the ground and for the kick to have travelled at least 15 metres (16\u00a0yd). In the experimental rules of 2019, a player can now also call a mark inside the opposition's 45-metre (49\u00a0yd) line after a clean catch from a kick played over 20 metres (22\u00a0yd) from outside the 45-metre (49\u00a0yd) line that does not touch the ground or any other player.[48]  In 2020, additional versions of the Mark came into force in Gaelic football.[49] The Advanced Mark allowed a ball to be fielded cleanly inside the opposition 45 when kicked forward over a distance greater than 20 metres (22\u00a0yd) from outside the opposition 45. The referee is required to blow the whistle as this occurs, at which point the player has the option to take the Mark or play on.[49]  There is also a Defensive Mark, which a defender can get from a long ball played into him.[49]  There are three main types of fouls in Gaelic football, which can result in the ball being given to the other team, a player being cautioned, a player being removed from the field, or even the game being terminated.  The following are considered technical fouls (\"fouling the ball\"):  Aggressive fouls are physical or verbal fouls committed by a player against an opponent or the referee. The player can be cautioned (shown a yellow card), ordered off the pitch without a substitute (red card),[52] or (as of January 2020) ejected from the match to the Sin Bin, where they must remain for ten minutes before returning to the field (black card).[53] Picking up two black cards risks a red card, and the substitute will serve out whatever time imposed by officials.  A dissent foul is a foul where a player fails to comply with the officials' judgment and\/or instructions. The player can be cautioned (shown a yellow card), ordered off the pitch without a substitute (red card), the free kick placement moved 13\u00a0m (14\u00a0yd) further down-field, or in certain circumstances, the game can be terminated. The following are considered dissent fouls:  If the ball goes over the crossbar, a point is scored and a white flag is raised by an umpire. A point is scored by either kicking the ball over the crossbar or fisting it over, in which case the hand must be closed while striking the ball. If the ball goes below the crossbar, a goal, worth three points, is scored, and a green flag is raised by an umpire. A goal is scored by kicking the ball into the net, not by fist-passing the ball into it. However, a player can strike the ball into the net with a closed fist if the ball was played to him by another player or came in contact with the post\/crossbar\/ground before connection. The goal is guarded by a goalkeeper. Scores are recorded in the format Goal Total-Point Total. To determine the score-line goals must be converted to points and added to the other points. For example, in a match with a final score of Team A 0\u201321 and Team B 4\u20138, Team A is the winner with 21 points, as Team B scored only 20 points (4 times 3, plus 8).  The level of tackling allowed is less robust than in rugby or Australian rules.  Shoulder-to-shoulder contact and slapping the ball out of an opponent's hand are permitted, but the following are all fouls:  A football match is overseen by up to eight officials:  The referee is responsible for starting and stopping play, recording the score, awarding frees, and booking, and sending off players.  Linesmen are responsible for indicating the direction of line balls to the referee.  The fourth official is responsible for overseeing substitutions and also indicating the amount of stoppage time (signalled to him by the referee) and the players substituted using an electronic board.  The umpires are responsible for judging the scoring. They indicate to the referee whether a shot was: wide (spread both arms), a 45-metre (49\u00a0yd) kick (raise one arm), a point (wave white flag), a square ball (cross arms) or a goal (wave green flag). A disallowed score is indicated by crossing the green and white flags.  Other officials are not obliged to indicate any misdemeanours to the referee; they are only permitted to inform the referee of violent conduct they have witnessed that has occurred without the referee's knowledge. A linesman\/umpire is not permitted to inform the referee of technical fouls such as a \"double bounce\" or an illegal pick-up of the ball. Such decisions can only be made at the discretion of the referee.  The Team of the Century was nominated in 1984 by Sunday Independent readers and selected by a panel of experts including journalists and former players.[55] It was not chosen as part of the Gaelic Athletic Association's centenary year celebrations. The goal was to single out the best 15 players who had played the game in their respective positions. Naturally, many of the selections were hotly debated by fans around the country.  The Team of the Millennium was a team chosen in 1999 by a panel of GAA past presidents and journalists. The goal was to single out the best 15 players who had played the game in their respective positions, since the foundation of the GAA in 1884 up to the Millennium year, 2000. Naturally, many of the selections were hotly debated by fans around the country.  Gaelic sports at all levels are amateur, in the sense that the athletes, even those playing at an elite level, do not receive payment for their performance.  The main competitions at all levels of Gaelic football are the League and the Championship. Of these, it is the Championship (a knock-out tournament) that tends to attain the most prestige.  The basic unit of each game is organised at the club level, which is usually arranged on a parochial basis. Local clubs compete against other clubs in their county intending to win the County Club Championship at senior, junior, or intermediate levels (for adults) or under-21, minor or under-age levels (for children). A club may field more than one team, for example, a club may field a team at the senior level and a \"seconds\" team at a junior or intermediate level. This format is laid out in the table below:  Clubs may come together in districts for the County Championship or compete on their own.  Though the island of Ireland was partitioned between two states by the British parliament in 1920, the organisation of Gaelic games (like that of most cultural organisations and religions) continues on an All-Ireland basis. At the national level, Ireland's Gaelic games are organised in 32 GAA counties, most of which are identical in name and extent to the 32 administrative counties on which local government throughout the island was based until the late 20th century.[56] The term \"county\" is also used for some overseas GAA places, such as London and New York. Clubs are also located throughout the world, in other parts of the United States, in Great Britain, in Canada, in Asia, in Australasia and continental Europe.  The level at which county teams compete against each other is referred to as inter-county (i.e. similar to international). A county panel\u2014a team of 15 players, plus a similar number of substitutes\u2014is formed from the best players playing at the club level in each county. The most prestigious inter-county competition in Gaelic football is the All-Ireland Championship. The highest-level national championship is called the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. Nearly all counties contest this tournament on an annual basis, with crowds of people thronging venues the length and breadth of Ireland\u2014the most famous of these stadiums being Croke Park\u2014to support their local county team, a team comprising players selected from the clubs in that county. These modified knock-out games start as provincial championships contested by counties against other counties in their respective province, the four Irish provinces of Ulster, Munster, Leinster and Connacht. The four victors in these then progress automatically to the All-Ireland series.  In the past, the team winning each provincial championship would play one of the others, at a stage known as the All-Ireland semi-finals, with the winning team from each game playing each other in the famed All-Ireland Final to determine the outright winner. A recent (the 1990s\/2000s) re-organisation created a \"back door\" method of qualifying, with teams knocked out during the provincial rounds of the All-Ireland Championship now acquiring a second chance at glory. Now the four victorious teams at the provincial level enter the recently created All-Ireland quarter-finals instead, where they compete against the four remaining teams from the All-Ireland Qualifiers to progress to the All-Ireland semi-finals and then the All-Ireland Final. This re-organisation means that one team may defeat another team in an early stage of the championship, yet be defeated and knocked out of the tournament by the same team at a later stage. It also means a team may be defeated in an early stage of the championship, yet be crowned All-Ireland champions\u2014as Tyrone was in 2005 and 2008.  The secondary competition at the inter-county level is the National League. The National Football League is held every spring and groups counties into four divisions according to their relative strength. As at local (county) levels of Gaelic football, the League at a national level is less prestigious than the Championship\u2014however, in recent years attendances have grown, as has interest from the public and players. This is due in part to the 2002 adoption of a February\u2013April timetable, in place of the former November start, as well as the provision of Division 2 final stages. Live matches are aired on the international channel Setanta Sports and the Irish language channel TG4, with highlights shown on RT\u00c9 Two.  There are also All-Ireland championships for county teams at Junior, Under-21 and Minor levels, and provincial and national club championships, contested by the teams that win their respective county championships. "},{"title":"List of islands of Scotland","content":"    This is a list of islands of Scotland, the mainland of which is part of the island of Great Britain. Also included are various other related tables and lists. The definition of an offshore island used in this list is \"land that is surrounded by seawater on a daily basis, but not necessarily at all stages of the tide, excluding human devices such as bridges and causeways\".[Note 1]  Scotland has around 900 offshore islands,[1] most of which are to be found in four main groups: Shetland, Orkney, and the Hebrides, sub-divided into the Inner Hebrides and Outer Hebrides.[2] There are also clusters of islands in the Firth of Clyde, Firth of Forth, and Solway Firth, and numerous small islands within the many bodies of fresh water in Scotland including Loch Lomond and Loch Maree. The largest island is Lewis and Harris which extends to 2,179\u00a0square kilometres, and there are a further 200 islands which are greater than 40 hectares in area. Of the remainder, several such as Staffa and the Flannan Isles are well known despite their small size.[2] Some 94 Scottish islands are permanently inhabited, of which 89 are offshore islands. Between 2001 and 2011 Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.[3]  The geology and geomorphology of the islands is varied. Some, such as Skye and Mull, are mountainous, while others like Tiree and Sanday are relatively low lying. Many have bedrock made from ancient Archaean Lewisian Gneiss which was formed 3 billion years ago; Shapinsay and other Orkney islands are formed from Old Red Sandstone, which is 400 million years old; and others such as R\u00f9m from more recent Tertiary volcanoes.[4] Many of the islands are swept by strong tides, and the Corryvreckan tide race between Scarba and Jura is one of the largest whirlpools in the world.[5] Other strong tides are to be found in the Pentland Firth between mainland Scotland and Orkney, and another example is the \"Grey Dog\" between Scarba and Lunga.[2]  The culture of the islands has been affected by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse and English speaking peoples and this is reflected in names given to the islands. Many of the Hebrides have names with Scots Gaelic derivations, whilst those of the Northern Isles tend to be derived from the Viking names. A few have Brythonic, Scots and even perhaps pre-Celtic roots.[2] A feature of modern island life is the low crime rate and they are considered to be amongst the safest places to live in Britain.[6] Orkney was rated as the best place to live in Scotland in both 2013 and 2014 according to the Halifax Quality of Life survey.[7]  Rockall is a small rocky islet in the North Atlantic which was declared part of Scotland by the Island of Rockall Act 1972.[8][9] However, despite no possession by any other state and other precedents, the legality of the claim is disputed by the Republic of Ireland, Denmark and Iceland and some say, it may be unenforceable in international law.[10][11]  The 2011 census records 94 Scottish islands as having a usually resident population of which 89 are offshore islands. There are however various complications with both the definitions of an \"island\" and occasional habitation and the National Records of Scotland also list a further 17 islands that were inhabited in 2001 but not 2011, or are \"included in the NRS statistical geography for inhabited islands but had no usual residents at the time of either the 2001 or 2011 censuses\".[13] There are a small number of other islands that are evidently inhabited but which are not recorded in this list.[Note 2]  The local government council areas with the most inhabited islands are Argyll and Bute with 23, Orkney with 20, Shetland with 16 and Highland and Comhairle nan Eilean Siar with 14 each. There are also three in North Ayrshire and one each in Fife, Perth and Kinross, Stirling and West Dunbartonshire. The last three named plus two islands in Argyll and Bute are freshwater rather than offshore.[13]  In the past many smaller islands that are uninhabited today had permanent populations. Losses were severe in many areas during the 19th century when islands such as Pabbay and Fuaigh M\u00f2r were subject to forcible evictions during the Highland Clearances.[15] Mass emigration from the Hebridean islands was at its height in the mid-19th century but it commenced as early as the 1770s in some areas.[16] The crofting counties held 20% of Scotland's population in 1755 but by 1961 this figure had declined to 5%.[17] Other examples include Mingulay, Noss and the St Kilda archipelago, which were abandoned during the course of the 20th century. Declines have been particularly significant in the more remote outlying islands, some of which remain vulnerable to ongoing losses.[18]  The following table shows population trends for the ten most populous islands as of the last census. The overall trends are typically growth in populations in the early part of the modern period, followed by declines from the mid 19th century onwards. In every case except Orkney the highest population was recorded prior to 1932 and the lowest post-industrial revolution figure after 1960. Subsequently, there has been modest growth overall, although some islands are continuing to show a decline. Between 1991 and 2001, the population of the islands as a whole fell by 3% to 99,739, although there were 35 islands whose population increased.[19] By contrast, between 2001 and 2011 Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.[3] The Scottish Community Alliance noted that \"the largest rate of increase has been in the Western Isles (6%) where local people now own approximately 60% of the landmass. Where populations have fallen (Bute, Arran and Islay) community ownership is virtually non-existent.\"[20]  The following table compares the populations of the main Scottish archipelagos with that of the Faroe Islands for a similar time frame to the above.[Note 3]  In July 2013, the Scottish Government made the Lerwick Declaration, indicating an intention to decentralise power to the three island council areas of Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles and later that year made a commitment to do so.[37] In 2017 an Islands bill was introduced to make \"island proofing\" (including for uninhabited islands) a statutory requirement for public bodies. The Bill completed Stage 1 on 8 February 2018.[38]  This is a list of Scottish islands that either have an area greater than 40\u00a0hectares (approximately 100\u00a0acres) and\/or are inhabited. The main groups, from Haswell-Smith (2004), in many cases provide a more useful guide to location than local authority areas. These groups are: Firth of Clyde, Islay, Firth of Lorn, Mull, Small Isles, Skye, Lewis and Harris, Uists and Barra, St Kilda, Orkney, Shetland and Firth of Forth. In a few cases where the island is part of either a recognisable smaller group or an archipelago, or is located away from the main groups, an archipelago, local authority or other descriptive name is used instead. \"F\" designates a freshwater island.  Scotland's islands include thirteen Munros (mountains with a height over 3,000\u00a0feet or 914.4\u00a0metres), twelve of them found on Skye, and a total of 227 Marilyns (hills with a relative height of at least 150\u00a0metres, regardless of absolute height).[39]  Four islands were recorded as inhabited in 2011 that were not mentioned in the 2001 census: Eilean d\u00e0 Mh\u00e8inn, Eilean Tioram, Holm of Grimbister and Inner Holm.[13]  These following are listed by the National Records of Scotland as \"included in the NRS statistical geography for inhabited islands but had no usual residents at the time of either the 2001 or 2011 censuses.\"[13] None except Lamb Holm are greater than 40 ha in area.  There are numerous other freshwater islands, of which the more notable include Lochindorb Castle Island, Loch Leven Castle Island, St Serf's Inch, and Inchmahome, each of which have played an important part in Scottish history.  Inchmurrin is the largest freshwater island in the British Isles.[46][47] It is in Loch Lomond, which contains over sixty other islands.[47] Loch Maree also contains several islands, the largest of which are Eilean S\u00f9bhainn, Garbh Eilean and Eilean Ruairidh M\u00f2r but aren't as big as others.  This is a continuing list of uninhabited Scottish islands smaller than 40 hectares in size.  There are various small archipelagos which may be better known than the larger islands they contain. These include:  The following is a list of places which were formerly islands, but which are no longer so due to silting up, harbour building etc.  Many of Scotland's islands are connected to the mainland and\/or other islands by bridge or causeway. Although some people consider them no longer to be islands, they are generally treated as such.  Outer Hebrides  Many of the islands of the southern Outer Hebrides have been joined to other islands by causeways and bridges. These include:  To the north, Scalpay and Great Bernera are connected to Lewis and Harris.  Inner Hebrides  Orkney Islands  Similarly, four Orkney islands are joined to the Orkney Mainland by a series of causeways known as the Churchill Barriers. They are:  Hunda is in turn connected to Burray via a causeway.  South Walls and Hoy are connected by a causeway called the Ayre. The islands are treated as one entity (Hoy) by the UK census.  An undersea tunnel between the archipelago and Caithness, at a length of about 9\u201310 miles (14\u201316\u00a0km) and a tunnel connecting Orkney Mainland to Shapinsay have been discussed,[57][58] although little has come of it.  Shetland Islands  Several Shetland islands are joined to the Shetland Mainland:  There is also a bridge from Housay to Bruray.  Others  Various other islands are also connected by bridges or causeways, to the mainland or other islands, including:  There are a large number of small tidal islands in Scotland. The more notable ones include:  Oronsay means \"ebb island\" and there are several tidal islands of this name.[61]  The three main islands of the Monach Islands (Heisgeir), Ceann Iar, Ceann Ear and Shivinish are connected at low tides. It is said that at one time it was also possible to walk all the way to Baleshare, and on to North Uist, five miles (eight kilometres) away at low tide. In the 16th century, a large tidal wave was said to have washed the route away.[2]  St Ninian's Isle is connected to Mainland Shetland by a tombolo. Although greater than 40 hectares in size it fails to meet the definition of an island used in this list as it is only surrounded by water during occasional spring tides and storms.[62]  D\u00f9n in St Kilda is separated from Hirta by a shallow strait about 50 metres (160 feet) wide. This is normally impassable but is reputed to dry out on rare occasions.[2]  There are a number of offshore islands that defy easy classification.  There are several small Scottish islands that are dominated by a castle or other fortification. The castle is often better known than the island, and the islands are often tidal or bridged. Due to their picturesque nature some of them are well known from postcards and films. Examples are:  Many of the Islands of the Forth and southern Orkney Islands have fortifications from the two world wars. Rosyth Castle stands on a former island.  A large number of the islands of Scotland have some kind of culdee\/church connection, and\/or are dominated by a church. The more notable include:  Brother Isle's name is not ecclesiastical in origin as is sometimes stated.  This is a list of islands, which are known to be named after someone. In some cases such as North Ronaldsay this status may not be obvious (it isn't named after a \"Ronald\", unlike South Ronaldsay). This list omits names such as Hildasay, where the person in question is mythological, or Ailsa Craig, where the individual in question is not known, and also Colonsay & Egilsay where the derivation is disputed.  Iqbal Singh, the owner of Vacsay, has also expressed wishes to rename it after Robert Burns.  Some places in Scotland with names including \"isle\" or \"island\" are not islands. They include:  Lewis and Harris are separated by a range of hills but form one island, and are sometimes referred to as \"Lewis and Harris\". Isle of Whithorn and the Black Isle are peninsulas, and Isleornsay is a village which looks out onto the island of Ornsay. There is no commonly accepted derivation for \"Burntisland\" which had numerous other forms in the past, such as \"Brintilun\" and \"Ye Brint Eland\".[63]  Gluss Isle at the western entrance to Sullom Voe is one of the many promontories in Orkney and Shetland connected to a larger body of land by an ayre.  The name \"Inch\" (Innis) can mean island (e.g. Inchkenneth, Inchcolm), but is also used for terra firma surrounded by marsh e.g. Markinch, Insch.  Eilean is Gaelic for \"island\". However, Inistrynich, Eilean na Maodail, Eilean Dubh and Liever Island are all promontories on Loch Awe as opposed to islands, despite their names. Likewise Eilean Aoidhe on Loch Fyne. The Black Isle is also An t-Eilean Dubh in Gaelic, while Eilean Glas is part of Scalpay.  \"-holm\" is also common as a suffix in various landlocked placenames, especially in the far south of mainland Scotland e.g. Langholm, Kirk Yetholm, Holmhead (by Cumnock), Holmhill (next to Thornhill, Nithsdale). Some of these were river islands in their time, or dry land surrounded by marsh. \"Holm\" can be found in an element in Holmsgarth, now a suburb of Lerwick and the Parish of Holm on Mainland Shetland and Mainland Orkney respectively. Neither of these is an island in its own right.  Likewise, occasionally an island may be named after a location on the nearby mainland, or a major neighbouring island - or vice versa. Examples of this include: Vementry, which was originally the name of an island, but whose name has been transferred to a nearby farm on Mainland Shetland; Oldany Island, whose name has been transferred to Oldany; Cramond Island which is named after neighbouring Cramond (a district of Edinburgh); and Eilean Mhealasta in the Outer Hebrides, which is named after Mealista on Lewis.  The name Easdale appears to be the combination of eas, which is Gaelic for \"waterfall\" and dal, the Norse for \"valley\".[64] However, it is not clear why either description should apply to this tiny island which is low lying and has no waterfalls and the name may have come from the nearby village of the same name on Seil.[65]  It has been estimated that there are about 275 sea stacks in Scotland of which circa 110 are located around the coasts of Shetland.[66] The highest are Stac an Armin and Stac Lee,[67] St Kilda. In July 1967 15 million people watched the climbing of the Old Man of Hoy live on BBC television.[68] However, for many of the remoter stacks especially in Shetland, there is no record of there having been any attempt by rock climbers to ascend them.[69]  Crannogs are prehistoric artificial islands created in lochs. There are several hundred sites in Scotland.

It was founded in 1886 in order to establish standardised regulations or \"Laws\" for the gameplay of international competition, and has since acted as the primary maintainer (\"Guardian\") of these Laws. FIFA, a prominent governing body for football, has recognised IFAB's jurisdiction over its Laws since its establishment in 1904.[1]  IFAB is a distant body from FIFA, although FIFA is represented on the board and holds 50% of the voting power. The founding football associations (FAs) of IFAB, England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales each have permanent seats on the organisation. Amendments to the Laws mandate a three-quarter supermajority vote, meaning that FIFA's support is necessary but not sufficient for a motion to pass.  Although the rules of football had largely been standardised by the early 1880s, England's Football Association (The FA), the Scottish Football Association (SFA), the Football Association of Wales (FAW) and the Irish Football Association (IFA) had conflicting rules. When international matches were played, the rules of the home team's national association were used. While this solution was technically feasible, it was impractical. To remedy this, the FAs initialised a meeting on 6 December 1882 in Queen\u2019s Hotel, Manchester in order to systematise a set of rules that could be applied uniformly to matches between the UK football associations' national teams. This was later named the \u201cInternational Football Conference\u201d.  In the summer of 1885, the English FA declared that it legalised professionalism.[2]  The Scottish FA responded that it would refuse to allow professionals in its own national team, and would refuse to play international matches against an England team containing professionals.[3] The Irish FA attempted to arbitrate by proposing that \"an international conference should be held each year, say, in August, to be called in turn by each national association to deal with the laws of the game, and discuss other matters of interest to Association football, and at which international disputes could be adjusted\".[4]  The initial meeting of IFAB took place at The FA's offices at Holborn Viaduct in London on 2 June 1886.[5] The FA, SFA, FAW and IFA each had equal voting rights. It was chaired by Sir Francis Marindin, and attended by Charles W. Alcock acting as Secretary.[6] The meeting was notable for Marindin\u2019s proposal, which outlined \"That no player shall wear any kind of projection on the soles of heels of his boots with the exception of flat leather bars of an approved pattern\".[6]  During IFAB\u2019s annual general meeting (AGM) on 8 June 1912, the secretary, J.K. McDowall, scrutinised a letter that was attributed to the recently established FIFA, requesting that IFAB would invite a member of FIFA to sit on the Board. [7]The petition was analysed, and IFAB concluded that it wasn\u2019t the right time to establish FIFA as a member, and McDowall proceeded to write a response to the organisation explaining the consensus. At a special meeting held on 25 January 1913 in Wrexham, IFAB approved FIFA\u2019s request after a proposition by The FA was made proposing that two members from FIFA should attend the board, making FIFA the fifth member of IFAB.   For the first four post-war IFAB meetings (1920, 1921, 1922, and 1923), FIFA was once again excluded, on account of a dispute between FIFA and the home nations regarding payments to amateur players. From 1924, the dispute had been reconciled, and FIFA resumed attendance of IFAB meetings. In 1958, the Board agreed on a voting system that would be used to this day.[8]  Since Irish partition in 1921, the IFA has evolved to become the organising body for football in Northern Ireland, with football in the Republic of Ireland being organised by the FAI.  A request for the FAI to become a member of IFAB was denied at the 1923 annual general meeting.[9]  The IFAB is made up of representatives from England's Football Association (The FA), the Scottish Football Association (SFA), the Football Association of Wales (FAW) and Northern Ireland's Irish Football Association (IFA)\u2014and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA, the International Association Football Federation), the international governing body for football. Each British association has one vote and FIFA has four. IFAB deliberations must be approved by three-quarters of the vote, or at least six of the eight votes.[10] Thus, FIFA's approval is necessary for any IFAB decision, but FIFA alone cannot change the Laws of the Game\u2014they need to be agreed by at least two of the UK members. As of 2016, all members must be present for a binding vote to proceed.[10]  The Board meets twice a year, once to decide on possible changes to the rules governing the game of Football (the Annual General Meeting (AGM)) and once to deliberate on its internal affairs (the Annual Business Meeting (ABM)). In FIFA World Cup years, the AGM is held at FIFA's offices; otherwise, it rotates between Northern Ireland, Wales, England and Scotland in that order.[10] Four weeks before the AGM, the member associations must send their written proposals to the secretary of the host association. FIFA then prints a list of suggestions that are distributed to all other associations for examination. The AGM is held either in February or March and the ABM is held between September and October.[11] In cases of necessity, the Board can meet in a Special Meeting in addition to the two ordinary annual meetings. As of December 2012, the last Special Meeting was hosted by FIFA in Z\u00fcrich on 5 July 2012.[12]  The decisions of each year's Annual General Meeting of the Board regarding changes to the Laws of the Game enter into force from 1 July (and are binding on FIFA and on the other members of the Board, and, given that FIFA's Statutes establish that FIFA and its member associations and affiliates adhere to the Laws of the Game laid down by IFAB, those changes bind also FIFA's other member associations, FIFA's continental confederations of member associations, and the subnational entities of the national associations) but confederations, member associations and other bodies whose current season has not ended by 1 July may delay the introduction of the adopted alterations to the Laws of the Game in their competitions until the beginning of their next season.[13] As well as permanent changes to the Laws, IFAB also authorises trials of potential amendments.[14] "},{"title":"Forward pass","content":"  In several forms of football, a forward pass is the throwing of the ball in the direction in which the offensive team is trying to move, towards the defensive team's goal line. The legal and widespread use of the forward pass distinguishes gridiron football (American football and Canadian football) from rugby football (union and league) from which the gridiron code evolved, in which the play is illegal.  Illegal and experimental forward passes had been attempted as early as 1876, but the first legal forward pass in American football took place in 1906, after a change in the rules. Another rule change on January 18, 1951, established that no center or guard could receive a forward pass, and a tackle may only do so if he announces his intent to the referee beforehand that he will be an eligible receiver, called a tackle-eligible play. The only linemen who can receive a forward pass are the ends (tight ends and wide receivers). The rules regulate who may throw and who may receive a forward pass, and under what circumstances, as well as how the defensive team may try to prevent a pass from being completed. The primary passer is the quarterback, and statistical analysis is used to determine a quarterback's success rate at passing in various situations, as well as a team's overall success at the passing game.  In gridiron football, a forward pass is usually referred to simply as a pass, and consists of a player throwing the football towards the opponent's goal line.  This is permitted only once during a scrimmage down by the offensive team before team possession has changed, provided the pass is thrown from behind the line of scrimmage; a pass is legal as long as some part of the passer's body is behind the line of scrimmage. The person passing the ball must be a member of the offensive team, and the recipient of the forward pass must be an eligible receiver and must touch the passed ball before any ineligible player. An illegal forward pass can incur a yardage penalty and the loss of a down, although it may be legally intercepted by the opponents and advanced.  If an eligible receiver on the passing team legally catches the ball, the pass is completed and the receiver may attempt to advance the ball. If an opposing player legally catches the ball \u2013 all defensive players are eligible receivers \u2013 it is an interception. That player's team immediately gains possession of the ball and he may attempt to advance the ball toward his opponent's goal. If no player is able to legally catch the ball it is an incomplete pass and the ball becomes dead the moment it touches the ground. It will then be returned to the original line of scrimmage for the next down. If any player interferes with an eligible receiver's ability to catch the ball it is pass interference which draws a penalty of varying degrees, depending upon the particular league's rules.  The moment that a forward pass begins is important to the game. The pass begins the moment the passer's arm begins to move forward. If the passer drops the ball before this moment it is a fumble and therefore a loose ball. In this case anybody can gain possession of the ball before or after it touches the ground. If the passer drops the ball while his arm is moving forward it is a forward pass, regardless of where the ball lands or is first touched.[1][2] At some levels of play, a video replay may be required for the game's officials to conclusively determine if a play is a fumble or a forward pass.  The quarterback generally either starts a few paces behind the line of scrimmage or drops back a few steps after the ball is snapped.  This places him in an area called the \"pocket\", which is a specific protective region formed by the offensive blockers up front and between the tackles on each side.  A quarterback who runs out of this pocket is said to be scrambling.  Under NFL and NCAA rules, once the quarterback moves out of the pocket the ball may be legally thrown away to prevent a sack. NFHS (high school) rules do not allow for a passer to intentionally throw an incomplete forward pass to save loss of yardage or conserve time, except for a spike to conserve time after a hand-to-hand snap.  If he throws the ball away while still in the pocket then a foul called \"intentional grounding\" is assessed. In Canadian football the passer must simply throw the ball across the line of scrimmage \u2013 whether he is inside or outside of the \"pocket\"\u2014to avoid the foul of \"intentionally grounding\".  If a forward pass is caught near a sideline or endline it is a complete pass (or an interception) only if a receiver catches the ball \"in bounds\". For a pass to be ruled complete in-bounds, either one or two feet must touch the ground within the field boundaries after the ball is first grasped, depending on the league rules. In the NFL the receiver must touch the ground with both feet, but in most other codes \u2013 CFL, NCAA and high school \u2013 one foot in bounds is sufficient.  Common to all gridiron codes is the notion of control: a receiver must demonstrate control of the ball in order to be ruled in \"possession\" of it, while still in bounds.  If the receiver handles the ball but the official determines that he was still \"bobbling\" it prior to the end of the play, then the pass will be ruled incomplete.  Similarly, if the receiver fails to continue to control the ball after falling to the ground, the pass may be ruled incomplete.  The forward pass had been attempted at least 30 years before the play was actually made legal.  Passes \"had been carried out successfully but illegally several times, including the 1876 Yale\u2013Princeton game in which Yale's Walter Camp threw forward to teammate Oliver Thompson as he was being tackled.  Princeton's protest, one account said, went for naught when the referee 'tossed a coin to make his decision and allowed the touchdown to stand'\u00a0\".[3]  The University of North Carolina used the forward pass in an 1895 game against the University of Georgia.  However, the play was still illegal at the time. Bob Quincy stakes Carolina's claim in his 1973 book They Made the Bell Tower Chime:  John Heisman, namesake of the Heisman Trophy, wrote 30 years later that, indeed, the Tar Heels had given birth to the forward pass against the Bulldogs (UGA). It was conceived to break a scoreless deadlock and give UNC a 6\u20130 win. The Carolinians were in a punting situation and a Georgia rush seemed destined to block the ball. The punter, with an impromptu dash to his right, tossed the ball and it was caught by George Stephens, who ran 70 yards for a touchdown.  In a 1905 experimental game at Wichita, Kansas, Washburn University and Fairmount College (what would become Wichita State) used the pass before new rules allowing the play were approved in early 1906.[4]  Credit for the first pass goes to Fairmount's Bill Davis, who completed a pass to Art Solter.[5]  1905 had been a bloody year on the gridiron; the Chicago Tribune reported 19 players had been killed and 159 seriously injured that season.[6] There were moves to outlaw the game, but United States President Theodore Roosevelt personally intervened and demanded that the rules of the game be reformed.  In a meeting of more than 60 schools in late 1905, the commitment was made to make the game safer.  This meeting was the first step toward the establishment of what would become the NCAA and was followed by several sessions to work out \"the new rules.\"[7]  The final meeting of the Rules Committee tasked with reshaping the game was held on April 6, 1906, at which time the forward pass officially became a legal play.[4] The New York Times reported in September 1906 on the rationale for the changes: \"The main efforts of the football reformers have been to 'open up the game'\u2014that is to provide for the natural elimination of the so-called mass plays and bring about a game in which speed and real skill shall supersede so far as possible mere brute strength and force of weight.\"[8]  However, the Times also reflected widespread skepticism as to whether the forward pass could be effectively integrated into the game: \"There has been no team that has proved that the forward pass is anything but a doubtful, dangerous play to be used only in the last extremity.\"[9] John Heisman was instrumental in the rules' acceptance.  In Canadian football, the first exhibition game using a forward pass was held on November 5, 1921, at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, between the McGill Redmen football team and visiting American college football team the Syracuse Orangemen from Syracuse University.  The game was organized by Frank Shaughnessy, the head coach of McGill.[10][11]  McGill player Robert \"Boo\" Anderson is credited with the first forward pass attempt in Canadian football history.[12]  The forward pass was not officially allowed in Canadian football until 1929.[13]  Most sources credit Saint Louis University's Bradbury Robinson from Bellevue, Ohio with throwing the first legal forward pass. On September 5, 1906, in a game against Carroll College, Robinson's first attempt at a forward pass fell incomplete and resulted in a turnover under the 1906 rules.[14] In the same game, Robinson later completed a 20-yard touchdown pass to Jack Schneider. The 1906 Saint Louis University team, coached by Eddie Cochems, was undefeated at 11\u20130 and featured the most potent offense in the country, outscoring their opponents 407\u201311. Football authority and College Football Hall of Fame coach David M. Nelson wrote that \"E. B. Cochems is to forward passing what the Wright brothers are to aviation and Thomas Edison is to the electric light.\"[4]  While Saint Louis University completed the first legal forward pass in the first half of September, this accomplishment was in part because most schools did not begin their football schedule until early October.   In 1952, football coach Amos Alonzo Stagg discounted accounts crediting any particular coach with being the innovator of the forward pass.  Stagg noted that he had Walter Eckersall working on pass plays and saw Pomeroy Sinnock of Illinois throw many passes in 1906.  Stagg summed up his view as follows: \"I have seen statements giving credit to certain people originating the forward pass.  The fact is that all coaches were working on it.  The first season, 1906, I personally had sixty-four different forward pass patterns.\"[15]  In 1954, Stagg disputed Cochems' claim to have invented the forward pass: Eddie Cochems, who coached at [Saint] Louis University in 1906, also claimed to have invented the pass as we know it today ... It isn't so, because after the forward pass was legalized in 1906, most of the schools commenced experimenting with it and nearly all used.[16] Stagg asserted that, as far back as 1894, before the rules committee even considered the forward pass, one of his players used to throw the ball \"like a baseball pitcher.\"[16]  On the other hand, Hall of Fame  coach Gus Dorais told the United Press that \"Eddie Cochems of the [Saint] Louis University team of 1906\u201307\u201308 deserves the full credit.\"[17]  Writing in Collier's more than 20 years earlier, Dorais' Notre Dame teammate Knute Rockne acknowledged Cochems as the early leader in the use of the pass, observing, \"One would have thought that so effective a play would have been instantly copied and become the vogue. The East, however, had not learned much or cared much about Midwest and Western football. Indeed, the East scarcely realized that football existed beyond the Alleghanies ...\"[18]   Once the 1906 season got underway, many programs began experimenting with the forward pass. On September 26, 1906, Villanova's game against the Carlisle Indians was billed as \"the first real game of football under the new rules.\"[19] In the first play from scrimmage after the opening kicks, Villanova completed a pass that \"succeeded in gaining ten yards.\"[19]  Following the Villanova-Carlisle game, The New York Times described the new passing game this way: The passing was more of the character of that familiar in basket ball than that which has hitherto characterized football.  Apparently it is the intention of football coaches to try repeatedly these frequent long and risky passes.  Well executed they are undoubtedly highly spectacular, but the risk of dropping the ball is so great as to make the practice extremely hazardous and its desirability doubtful.[19]  Another coach sometimes credited with popularizing the overhead spiral pass in 1906 is former Princeton All-American \"Bosey\" Reiter.  Reiter claimed to have invented the overhead spiral pass while playing professional football as a player-coach for Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics of the original National Football League (1902).[20][21]  While playing for the Athletics, Reiter was a teammate of Hawley Pierce, a former star for the Carlisle Indian School.  Pierce, a Native American, taught Reiter to throw an underhand spiral pass, but Reiter had short arms and was unable to throw for distance from an underhand delivery.  Accordingly, Reiter began working on an overhand spiral pass.[20]  Reiter recalled trying to imitate the motion of a baseball catcher throwing to second base.  After practice and experimentation, Reiter \"discovered he could get greater distance and accuracy throwing that way.\"[20]  In 1906, Reiter was the head coach at Wesleyan University.  In the opening game of the 1906 season against Yale, Reiter's quarterback Sammy Moore completed a forward pass to Irvin van Tassell for a thirty-yard gain.  The New York Times called it \"the prettiest play of the day\", as Wesleyan's quarterback \"deftly passed the ball past the whole Yale team to his mate Van Tassel.\"[22]  Van Tassel later described the historic play to the United Press: I was the right halfback, and on this formation played one yard back of our right tackle.  The quarterback, Sam Moore, took the ball from center and faded eight or 10 yards back of our line.  Our two ends angled down the field toward the sidelines as a decoy, and I slipped through the strong side of our line straight down the center and past the secondary defense.  The pass worked perfectly.  However, the quarterback coming up fast nailed me as I caught it.  This brought the ball well into Yale territory, about the 20-yard line.[23][24] The football season opened for most schools during the first week of October, and the impact of the forward pass was immediate:  Some publications credit Yale All-American Paul Veeder with the \"first forward pass in a major game.\" Veeder threw a 20- to 30-yard completion in leading Yale past Harvard 6\u20130 before 32,000 fans in New Haven on November 24, 1906.[30][31][32]  However, that Yale\/Harvard game was played three weeks after St. Louis completed 45- and 48-yard passes against Kansas before a crowd of 7,000 at Sportsman's Park.[33][34]  The forward pass was a central feature of Cochems' offensive scheme in 1906 as his St. Louis University team compiled an undefeated 11\u20130 season in which they outscored opponents by a combined score 407 to 11.  The highlight of the campaign was St. Louis' 39\u20130 win over Iowa.  Cochems' team reportedly completed eight passes in ten attempts for four touchdowns. \"The average flight distance of the passes was twenty yards.\"  Nelson continues, \"the last play demonstrated the dramatic effect that the forward pass was having on football. St. Louis was on Iowa's thirty-five-yard line with a few seconds to play. Timekeeper Walter McCormack walked onto the field to end the game when the ball was thrown twenty-five yards and caught on the dead run for a touchdown.\"[4]  The 1906 Iowa game was refereed by one of the top football officials in the country, West Point's Lt. Horatio B. \"Stuffy\" Hackett.[35]  He had officiated games involving the top Eastern powers that year.  Hackett, who would become a member of the football rules committee in December 1907[36] and officiated games into the 1930s,[37] was quoted the next day in Ed Wray's[38] Globe-Democrat article: \"It was the most perfect exhibition ... of the new rules ... that I have seen all season and much better than that of Yale and Harvard.  St. Louis' style of pass differs entirely from that in use in the east. ... The St. Louis university players shoot the ball hard and accurately to the man who is to receive it ... The fast throw by St. Louis enables the receiving player to dodge the opposing players, and it struck me as being all but perfect.\"[39]  Hackett is the only known expert witness to the passing offenses of both Cochems' 1906 squads and that of Stagg, who dismissed any special role for the St. Louis coach in the development of the pass. Hackett was an official in games involving both teams. As Wray recalled almost 40 years later: \"Hackett told this writer that in no other game that he handled had he seen the forward pass as used by St. Louis U. nor such bewildering variations of it.\"[40]  \"Cochems said that the poor Iowa showing resulted from its use of the old style play and its failure to effectively use the forward pass\", Nelson writes. \"Iowa did attempt two basketball-style forward passes.\"[41]  \"During the 1906 season [Robinson] threw a sixty-seven yard pass ... and ... Schneider tossed a sixty-five yarder. Considering the size, shape and weight of the ball, these were extraordinary passes.\"[41]  In 1907, after the first season of the forward pass, one football writer noted that, \"with the single exception of Cochems, football teachers were groping in the dark.\"[42]  Because St. Louis was geographically isolated from both the dominant teams and the major sports media (newspapers) of the era, all centered in and focused on the East, Cochems' groundbreaking offensive strategy was not picked up by the major teams. Pass-oriented offenses would not be adopted by the Eastern football powers until the next decade.  But that does not mean that other teams in the Midwest did not pick it up. Arthur Schabinger, quarterback for the College of Emporia in Kansas, was reported to have regularly used the forward pass in 1910. Coach H. W. \"Bill\" Hargiss' \"Presbies\" are said to have featured the play in a 17\u20130 victory over Washburn University[43] and in a 107\u20130 destruction of Pittsburg State University.[44] Coach Pop Warner at Carlisle had quarterback Frank Mount Pleasant, one of the first regular spiral pass quarterbacks in football.[45]  Knute Rockne and Gus Dorais worked on the pass while lifeguarding on a Lake Erie beach at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, during the summer of 1913.[46] That year, Jesse Harper, Notre Dame head coach, also showed how the pass could be used by a smaller team to beat a bigger one, first utilizing it to defeat rival Army. After it was used against a major school on a national stage in this game, the forward pass rapidly gained popularity.[47]  The 1919 and 1920 Notre Dame teams had George Gipp, an ideal handler of the forward pass,[48][49] who threw for 1,789 yards.[50]  John Mohardt led the 1921 Notre Dame team to a 10\u20131 record with 781 rushing yards, 995 passing yards, 12 rushing touchdowns, and nine passing touchdowns.[51] Grantland Rice wrote that \"Mohardt could throw the ball to within a foot or two of any given space\" and noted that the 1921 team was the first at Notre Dame \"to build its attack around a forward passing game, rather than use a forward passing game as a mere aid to the running game.\"[52] Mohardt had both Eddie Anderson and Roger Kiley at end to receive his passes.  From 1915 to 1916, Pudge Wyman and end Bert Baston of Minnesota were \"one of the greatest forward-passing combinations in the history of the gridiron.\"[53][54]  In the 1921 Rose Bowl, California's Brick Muller completed a touchdown against Washington & Jefferson which went 53 yards in the air, a feat previously thought impossible.[55]  In a 1925, 62\u201313 victory over Cornell, Dartmouth's Andy Oberlander had 477 yards in total offense, including six touchdown passes,[56] a Dartmouth record which still stands.  The 1925 Michigan team was coach Fielding H. Yost's favorite and featured the passing tandem of Benny Friedman and Bennie Oosterbaan.  Yost disciple Dan McGugin coached Vanderbilt and was one of the first emphasize the forward pass.[57] His 1907 team beat Sewanee on a double pass play Grantland Rice cited as his biggest thrill in his years of watching sports.[58] McGugin's 1927 team was piloted by Bill Spears, who threw for over a thousand yards. According to one writer, Vanderbilt produced \"almost certainly the legit top Heisman candidate in Spears, if there had been a Heisman Trophy to award in 1927.\"[59] McGugin disciple and former quarterback Ray Morrison brought the pass to the southwest when he coached Gerald Mann at Southern Methodist.[48]  The first forward pass in a professional football game may have been thrown in an Ohio League game played on October 25, 1906.  The Ohio League, which traced its history to the 1890s, was a direct predecessor of the NFL. According to Robert W. Peterson in his book Pigskin The Early Years of Pro Football, the \"passer was George W. (Peggy) Parratt, probably the best quarterback of the era\", who played for the Massillon, Ohio Tigers, one of pro football's first franchises.[60]  Citing the Professional Football Researchers Association as his source, Peterson writes that \"Parratt completed a short pass to end Dan Riley (real name, Dan Policowski)\" in a game played at Massillon against a team from West Virginia.  Since the Tigers \"ran up a 61 to 0 score on the hapless Mountain Staters, the pass played no important part in the result.\"[61]  According to National Football League history,[62] it legalized the forward pass from anywhere behind the line of scrimmage on February 25, 1933. Before that rule change, a forward pass had to be made from 5 or more yards behind the line of scrimmage.  Forward passes were first permitted in Canadian football in 1929,[63] but the tactic remained a minor part of the game for several years. Jack Jacobs of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers is recognized, not for inventing the forward pass,  but for popularizing it in the Western Interprovincial Football Union (one of the forerunner leagues to the modern Canadian Football League) in the early 1950s, thus changing the Canadian game from a more run-dominated game to a more passing-dominant game.  Specification of the size of the ball for the American game came in 1912, but it was still essentially a rugby ball.  Increased use of the forward pass encouraged adoption of a narrower ball, starting with changes in the 1920s which enhanced rifled throwing and also spiral punting.[64] This had the consequence of all but eliminating the drop kick from the American game.[65]  In the two codes of rugby (union and league), a forward pass is against the rules. Normally this results in a scrum to the opposing team, but on rare occasions a penalty may be awarded if the referee is of the belief that the ball was deliberately thrown forward.[66]  In both codes of rugby the direction of the pass is relative to the player making the pass and not to the actual path relative to the ground. A forward pass occurs when the player passes the ball forward in relation to himself.[66] (This applies only to the movement of the player, not to the direction in which the passer is facing, i.e. if the player is facing backwards and passes toward their team's goal area, it is not forward; and conversely, if the player passes toward the opponent's goal area, it is forward.) In rugby league, the video referee may not make judgements on whether a pass is forward.[67]  The garryowen, as well as the cross-field kick, while not as reliable as the forward pass and more difficult to execute successfully, can provide some of the function that a forward pass does in American and Canadian football.  In some other football codes, such as association football (soccer), Australian rules football and Gaelic football, the kicked forward pass is used so ubiquitously that it is not thought of as a distinct kind of play at all. In association football and its variants, the concept of offside is used to regulate who can be in front of the play or be nearest to the goal. Historically some earlier incarnations of football allowed unlimited forward passing, and present-day Australian rules football and Gaelic football do not have an offside rule.  Notes  Bibliography "},{"title":"Canadian football","content":"  Canadian football, or simply football (in Canada), is a sport in Canada in which two teams of 12 players each compete on a field 110 yards (101\u00a0m) long and 65 yards (59\u00a0m) wide, attempting to advance a pointed oval-shaped ball into the opposing team's end zone.  American and Canadian football have shared origins and are closely related, but have some major differences.   Rugby football, from which Canadian football developed, was first recorded in Canada in the early 1860s,[1] taken there by British immigrants, possibly in 1824.[2] Both the Canadian Football League (CFL), the sport's top professional league, and Football Canada, the governing body for amateur play, trace their roots to 1880 and the founding of the Canadian Rugby Football Union.  The CFL is the most popular and only major professional Canadian football league. Its championship game, the Grey Cup, is one of Canada's biggest sporting events, attracting a large television audience.[3][4]  Canadian football is also played at high school, junior, collegiate, and semi-professional levels: the Canadian Junior Football League and Quebec Junior Football League are for players aged 18\u201322, post-secondary institutions compete in U Sports football for the Vanier Cup, and seniors in the Alberta Football League. The Canadian Football Hall of Fame is in Hamilton, Ontario.  The first documented football match was a practice game played on November 9, 1861, at University College, University of Toronto (approximately 400 yards or 370 metres west of Queen's Park). One of the participants in the game involving University of Toronto students was Sir William Mulock, later chancellor of the school.[1] A football club was formed at the university soon afterward, although its rules of play at this stage are unclear.[5]  The first written account of a game played was on October 15, 1862,[2] on the Montreal Cricket Grounds. It was between the First Battalion Grenadier Guards and the Second Battalion Scots Fusilier Guards resulting in a win by the Grenadier Guards 3 goals, 2 rouges to nothing.[6] In 1864, at Trinity College, Toronto, F. Barlow Cumberland, Frederick A. Bethune, and Christopher Gwynn, one of the founders of Milton, Massachusetts, devised rules based on rugby football.[1] The game gradually gained a following, with the Hamilton Football Club (later the Hamilton Tiger-Cats) formed on November 3, 1869. Montreal Football Club was formed on April 8, 1872. Toronto Argonaut Football Club was formed on October 4, 1873, and the Ottawa Football Club (later the Ottawa Rough Riders) on September 20, 1876. Of those clubs, only the Toronto club is still in continuous operation today.  This rugby-football soon became popular at Montreal's McGill University. McGill challenged Harvard University to a two-game series in 1874, using a hybrid game of English rugby devised by the University of McGill.[7][8]  The first attempt to establish a proper governing body and to adopt the current set of Rugby rules was the Foot Ball Association of Canada, organized on March 24, 1873, followed by the Canadian Rugby Football Union (CRFU) founded June 12, 1880,[9] which included teams from Ontario and Quebec. Later both the Ontario Rugby Football Union and Quebec Rugby Football Union (ORFU and QRFU respectively) were formed (January 1883), and then the Interprovincial (1907) and Western Interprovincial Football Union (1936) (IRFU and WIFU).[10] The CRFU reorganized into an umbrella organization forming the Canadian Rugby Union (CRU) in 1891.[11] The immediate forerunner to the current Canadian Football League was established in 1956 when the IRFU and WIFU formed an umbrella organization, the Canadian Football Council (CFC).[12] In 1958, the CFC left the CRU to become the \"Canadian Football League\" (CFL).  The Burnside rules closely resembling American football (which are similar rules developed by Walter Camp for that sport) that were incorporated in 1903 by the ORFU, were an effort to distinguish it from a more rugby-oriented game. The Burnside Rules had teams reduced to 12 men per side, introduced the snap-back system, required the offensive team to gain 10 yards on three downs, eliminated the throw-in from the sidelines, allowed only six men on the line, stated that all goals by kicking were to be worth two points and the opposition was to line up 10 yards from the defenders on all kicks. The rules were an attempt to standardize the rules throughout the country. The CIRFU, QRFU, and CRU refused to adopt the new rules at first.[13] Forward passes were not allowed in the Canadian game until 1929, and touchdowns, which had been five points, were increased to six points in 1956, in both cases several decades after the Americans had adopted the same changes. The primary differences between the Canadian and American games stem from rule changes that the American side of the border adopted but the Canadian side did not (originally, both sides had three downs, goal posts on the goal lines, and unlimited forward motion, but the American side modified these rules and the Canadians did not). The Canadian field width was one rule that was not based on American rules, as the Canadian game was played in wider fields and stadiums that were not as narrow as the American stadiums.  The Grey Cup was established in 1909, after being donated by Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey, Governor General of Canada, as the championship of teams under the CRU for the Rugby Football Championship of Canada.[13] Initially an amateur competition, it eventually became dominated by professional teams in the 1940s and early 1950s. The ORFU, the last amateur organization to compete for the trophy, withdrew from competition after the 1954 season.[14] The move ushered in the modern era of Canadian professional football, culminating in the formation of the present-day Canadian Football League in 1958.  Canadian football has mostly been confined to Canada, with the United States being the only other country to have hosted high-level Canadian football games. The CFL's controversial \"South Division\" as it would come to be officially known attempted to put CFL teams in the United States playing under Canadian rules in 1995. The Expansion was aborted after three years; the Baltimore Stallions were the most successful of the numerous Americans teams to play in the CFL, winning the 83rd Grey Cup. Continuing financial losses, a lack of proper Canadian football venues, a pervasive belief that the American teams were simply pawns to provide the struggling Canadian teams with expansion fee revenue, and the return of the NFL to Baltimore prompted the end of Canadian football on the American side of the border.  The CFL hosted the Touchdown Atlantic regular season game in Nova Scotia in 2005 and New Brunswick in 2010, 2011, and 2013. In 2013, Newfoundland and Labrador became the last province to establish football at the minor league level, with teams playing on the Avalon Peninsula and in Labrador City.[citation needed] The province however has yet to host a college or CFL game. Prince Edward Island, the smallest of the provinces, has also never hosted a CFL game.  On 13 February 2023, IFAF and Football Canada announced in a joint statement that the Canadian Amateur Football Rulebook would be an accepted rules code for international play, but would not be a substitute for world championships or world championship qualification.  \"As Football Canada continues to work with IFAF, I believe this opens the door for international friendlies and tournaments to be staged in Canada employing the infrastructure communities have invested in for our sport from coast to coast,\" Football Canada president and IFAF General Secretary Jim Mullin said in the joint statement.[15]  Canadian football is played at several levels in Canada; the top league is the professional nine-team Canadian Football League (CFL). The CFL regular season begins in June, and playoffs for the Grey Cup are completed by late November.[16] In cities with outdoor stadiums such as Edmonton, Winnipeg, Calgary, and Regina, low temperatures and icy field conditions can seriously affect the outcome of a game.  Amateur football is governed by Football Canada. At the university level, 27 teams play in four conferences under the auspices of U Sports; the U Sports champion is awarded the Vanier Cup.[17] Junior football is played by many after high school before joining the university ranks. There are 19 junior teams in three conferences in the Canadian Junior Football League competing for the Canadian Bowl.[18] The Quebec Junior Football League includes teams from Ontario and Quebec who battle for the Manson Cup.  Semi-professional leagues have grown in popularity in recent years, with the Alberta Football League becoming especially popular. The Northern Football Conference formed in Ontario in 1954 has also surged in popularity for former college players who do not continue to professional football. The Ontario champion plays against the Alberta champion for the \"National Championship\". The Canadian Major Football League is the governing body for the semi-professional game.  Women's football has gained attention in recent years in Canada. The first Canadian women's league to begin operations was the Maritime Women's Football League in 2004. The largest women's league is the Western Women's Canadian Football League.  The Canadian football field is 150 yards (137\u00a0m) long and 65 yards (59\u00a0m) wide, within which the goal areas are 20 yards (18\u00a0m) deep, and the goal lines are 110 yards (101\u00a0m) apart. Weighted pylons are placed on the inside corner of the intersections of the goal lines and end lines. Including the end zones, the total area of the field is 87,750 square feet (8,152\u00a0m2).  At each goal line is a set of 40-foot-high (12\u00a0m) goalposts, which consist of two uprights joined by an 18+1\u20442-foot-long (5.6\u00a0m) crossbar which is 10 feet (3\u00a0m) above the goal line. The goalposts may be H-shaped (both posts fixed in the ground) although in the higher-calibre competitions the tuning-fork design (supported by a single curved post behind the goal line, so that each post starts 10 feet (3\u00a0m) above the ground) is preferred.  The sides of the field are marked by white sidelines, the goal line is marked in white or yellow, and white lines are drawn laterally across the field every 5 yards (4.6\u00a0m) from the goal line. These lateral lines are called \"yard lines\" and often marked with the distance in yards from and an arrow pointed toward the nearest goal line. Prior to the early 1980s, arrows were not used and all yard lines (in both multiples of 5 and 10) were usually marked with the distance to the goal line, including the goal line itself which was marked with either a \"0\" or \"00\"; in most stadiums today, only the yard markers in multiples of 10 are marked with numbers, with the goal line sometimes being marked with a \"G\". The centre (55-yard) line usually is marked with a \"C\" (or, more rarely, with a \"55\"). \"Hash marks\" are painted in white, parallel to the yardage lines, at 1 yard (0.9\u00a0m) intervals, 24 yards (21.9\u00a0m) from the sidelines under amateur rules, but 28 yards (25.6\u00a0m) in the CFL.  On fields that have a surrounding running track, such as Molson Stadium and many universities, the end zones are often cut off in the corners to accommodate the track. Until 1986,[19] the end zones were 25 yards (23\u00a0m) deep, giving the field an overall length of 160 yards (150\u00a0m), and a correspondingly larger cutoff could be required at the corners. The first field to feature the shorter 20-yard end zone was Vancouver's BC Place (home of the BC Lions), which opened in 1983. This was particularly common among U.S.-based teams during the CFL's American expansion, where few American stadiums were able to accommodate the much longer and noticeably wider CFL field. The end zones in Toronto's BMO Field are only 18 yards instead of 20 yards.  Teams advance across the field through the execution of quick, distinct plays, which involve the possession of a brown, prolate spheroid ball with ends tapered to a point. The ball has two one-inch-wide white stripes.  At the beginning of a match, an official tosses a coin and allows the captain of the visiting team to call heads or tails. The captain of the team winning the coin toss is given the option of having first choice, or of deferring first choice to the other captain. The captain making first choice may either choose a) to kick off or receive the kick at the beginning of the half, or b) which direction of the field to play in. The remaining choice is given to the opposing captain. Before the resumption of play in the second half, the captain that did not have first choice in the first half is given first choice. Teams usually choose to defer, so it is typical for the team that wins the coin toss to kick to begin the first half and receive to begin the second.  Play begins at the start of each half with one team place-kicking the ball from its own end of the field: the 35-yard line in the CFL, the 45-yard line in amateur play. Both teams then attempt to catch the ball. The player who recovers the ball may run while holding the ball, or lateral throw the ball to a teammate.  Play stops when the ball carrier's knee, elbow, or any other body part aside from the feet and hands, is forced to the ground (a tackle); when a forward pass is not caught on the fly (during a scrimmage); when a touchdown (see below) or a field goal is scored; when the ball leaves the playing area by any means (being carried, thrown, or fumbled out of bounds); or when the ball carrier is in a standing position but can no longer move forwards (called forward progress). If no score has been made, the next play starts from scrimmage.  Before scrimmage, an official places the ball at the spot it was at the stop of clock, but no nearer than 24 yards from the sideline or 1 yard from the goal line. The line parallel to the goal line passing through the ball (line from sideline to sideline for the length of the ball) is referred to as the line of scrimmage. This line is similar to \"no-man's land\"; players must stay on their respective sides of this line until the play has begun again. For a scrimmage to be valid the team in possession of the football must have seven players, excluding the quarterback, within one yard of the line of scrimmage. The defending team must stay a yard or more back from the line of scrimmage.  On the field at the beginning of a play are two teams of 12 (and not 11 as in American football). The team in possession of the ball is the offence and the team defending is referred to as the defence. Play begins with a backwards pass through the legs (the snap) by a member of the offensive team, to another member of the offensive team. This is usually the quarterback or punter, but a \"direct snap\" to a running back is also not uncommon. If the quarterback or punter receives the ball, he may then do any of the following:  Each play constitutes a down. The offence must advance the ball at least ten yards towards the opponents' goal line within three downs or forfeit the ball to their opponents. Once ten yards have been gained the offence gains a new set of three downs (rather than the four downs given in American football). Downs do not accumulate. If the offensive team completes 10 yards on their first play, they lose the other two downs and are granted another set of three. If a team fails to gain ten yards in two downs they usually punt the ball on third down or try to kick a field goal (see below), depending on their position on the field. The team may, however use its third down in an attempt to advance the ball and gain a cumulative 10 yards.  The ball changes possession in the following instances:  There are many rules to contact in this type of football. The only player on the field who may be legally tackled is the player currently in possession of the football (the ball carrier). On a passing play a receiver, that is to say, an offensive player sent down the field to receive a pass, may not be interfered with (have his motion impeded, be blocked, etc.) unless he is within five yards of the line of scrimmage. Prior to a pass that goes beyond the line of scrimmage, a defender may not be impeded more than one yard past that line. Otherwise, any player may block another player's passage, so long as he does not hold or trip the player he intends to block. The kicker may not be contacted after the kick but before his kicking leg returns to the ground (this rule is not enforced upon a player who has blocked a kick). The quarterback may not be hit or tackled after throwing the ball, nor may he be hit while in the pocket (i.e. behind the offensive line) prior to that point below the knees or above the shoulders.  Infractions of the rules are punished with penalties, typically a loss of yardage of 5, 10 or 15 yards against the penalized team. Minor violations such as offside (a player from either side encroaching into scrimmage zone before the play starts) are penalized five yards, more serious penalties (such as holding) are penalized 10 yards, and severe violations of the rules (such as face-masking [grabbing the face mask attached to a player's helmet]) are typically penalized 15 yards. Depending on the penalty, the penalty yardage may be assessed from the original line of scrimmage, from where the violation occurred (for example, for a pass interference infraction), or from where the ball ended after the play. Penalties on the offence may, or may not, result in a loss of down; penalties on the defence may result in a first down being automatically awarded to the offence. For particularly severe conduct, the game official(s) may eject players (ejected players may be substituted for), or in exceptional cases, declare the game over and award victory to one side or the other. Penalties do not affect the yard line which the offence must reach to gain a first down (unless the penalty results in a first down being awarded); if a penalty against the defence results in the first down yardage being attained, then the offence is awarded a first down.  If the defence is penalized on a two-point convert attempt and the offence chooses to attempt the play again, the offence must attempt another two-point convert; it cannot change to a one-point attempt. Conversely, the offence can attempt a two-point convert following a defensive penalty on a one-point attempt.  Penalties may occur before a play starts (such as offside), during the play (such as holding), or in a dead-ball situation (such as unsportsmanlike conduct).  Penalties never result in a score for the offence. For example, a point-of-foul infraction committed by the defence in their end zone is not ruled a touchdown, but instead advances the ball to the one-yard line with an automatic first down. For a distance penalty, if the yardage is greater than half the distance to the goal line, then the ball is advanced half the distance to the goal line, though only up to the one-yard line (unlike American football, in Canadian football no scrimmage may start inside either one-yard line). If the original penalty yardage would have resulted in a first down or moving the ball past the goal line, a first down is awarded.  In most cases, the non-penalized team will have the option of declining the penalty; in which case the results of the previous play stand as if the penalty had not been called. One notable exception to this rule is if the kicking team on a 3rd down punt play is penalized before the kick occurs: the receiving team may not decline the penalty and take over on downs. After the kick is made, change of possession occurs and subsequent penalties are assessed against either the spot where the ball is caught, or the runback.  Canadian football distinguishes four ways of kicking the ball:  On any kicking play, all onside players (the kicker, and teammates behind the kicker at the time of the kick) may recover and advance the ball. Players on the kicking team who are not onside may not approach within five yards of the ball until it has been touched by the receiving team, or by an onside teammate.  The methods of scoring are:  Resumption of play following a score is conducted under procedures which vary with the type of score.  The game consists of two 30-minute halves, each of which is divided into two 15-minute quarters. The clock counts down from 15:00 in each quarter. Timing rules change when there are three minutes remaining in a half. A short break interval of 2 minutes occurs after the end of each quarter (a longer break of 15 minutes at halftime), and the two teams then change goals.  In the first 27 minutes of a half, the clock stops when:  The clock starts again when the referee determines the ball is ready for scrimmage, except for team time-outs (where the clock starts at the snap), after a time count foul (at the snap) and kickoffs (where the clock starts not at the kick but when the ball is first touched after the kick).  In the last three minutes of a half, the clock stops whenever the ball becomes dead. On kickoffs, the clock starts when the ball is first touched after the kick. On scrimmages, when it starts depends on what ended the previous play. The clock starts when the ball is ready for scrimmage except that it starts on the snap when on the previous play:  During the last three minutes of a half, the penalty for failure to place the ball in play within the 20-second play clock, known as a \"time count violation\" (this foul is known as \"delay of game\" in American football), is dramatically different from during the first 27 minutes. Instead of the penalty being 5 yards with the down repeated, the base penalty (except during convert attempts) becomes loss of down on first or second down, and 10 yards on third down with the down repeated. In addition, as noted previously, the referee can give possession to the defence for repeated deliberate time count violations on third down.  The clock does not run during convert attempts in the last three minutes of a half. If the 15 minutes of a quarter expire while the ball is live, the quarter is extended until the ball becomes dead. If a quarter's time expires while the ball is dead, the quarter is extended for one more scrimmage. A quarter cannot end while a penalty is pending: after the penalty yardage is applied, the quarter is extended one scrimmage. Note that the non-penalized team has the option to decline any penalty it considers disadvantageous, so a losing team cannot indefinitely prolong a game by repeatedly committing infractions.  In the CFL, if the game is tied at the end of regulation play, then each team is given an equal number of offensive possessions to break the tie. A coin toss is held to determine which team will take possession first; the first team scrimmages the ball at the opponent's 35-yard line and conducts a series of downs until it scores or loses possession. If the team scores a touchdown, starting with the 2010 season, it is required to attempt a two-point conversion.[23] The other team then scrimmages the ball at the opponent's 35-yard line and has the same opportunity to score. After the teams have completed their possessions, if one team is ahead, then it is declared the winner; otherwise, the two teams each get another chance to score, scrimmaging from the other 35-yard line. After this second round, if there is still no winner, during the regular season the game ends as a tie. In a playoff game, the teams continue to attempt to score from alternating 35-yard lines, until one team is leading after both have had an equal number of possessions.  In U Sports football, for the Uteck Bowl, Mitchell Bowl, and Vanier Cup, the same overtime procedure is followed until there is a winner.  Officials are responsible for enforcing game rules and monitoring the clock. All officials carry a whistle and wear black-and-white striped shirts and black caps except for the referee, whose cap is white.[clarification needed] Each carries a weighted orange flag that is thrown to the ground to signal that a foul has been called. An official who spots multiple fouls will throw their cap as a secondary signal.[24] The seven officials (of a standard seven-man crew; lower levels of play up to the university level use fewer officials) on the field are each tasked with a different set of responsibilities:[24]  Another set of officials, the chain crew, is responsible for moving the chains. The chains, consisting of two large sticks with a 10-yard-long chain between them, are used to measure for a first down. The chain crew stays on the sidelines during the game, but if requested by the officials they will briefly bring the chains on to the field to measure. A typical chain crew will have at least three people\u2014two members of the chain crew will hold either of the two sticks, while a third will hold the down marker. The down marker, a large stick with a dial on it, is flipped after each play to indicate the current down and is typically moved to the approximate spot of the ball. The chain crew system has been used for over 100 years and is considered to be an accurate measure of distance, rarely subject to criticism from either side.[25]  In the CFL, a game must be delayed if lightning strikes within 10\u00a0km (6\u00a0mi) of the stadium or for other severe weather conditions, or if dangerous weather is anticipated. In the regular season, if play has not resumed after 1 hour and at least half of the third quarter has been completed, the score stands as final;[26] this happened for the first time on August 9, 2019, when a Saskatchewan\u2013Montreal game was stopped late in the third quarter.[27]  If the stoppage is earlier in the game, or if it is a playoff or Grey Cup game, play may be stopped for up to 3 hours and then resume. After 3 hours of stoppage, play is terminated at least for the day. A playoff or Grey Cup game must then be resumed the following day at the point where it left off.[26]  In the regular season, if a game is stopped for 3 hours and one team is leading by at least a certain amount, then that team is awarded a win. The size of lead required is 21, 17, or 13 depending on whether the stoppage is in the first, second, or third quarter respectively. If neither team is leading by that much and they are not scheduled to play again in the season, the game is declared a tie.[26]  If a regular-season game is stopped for 3 hours and neither team is leading by the required amount to be awarded a win, but the two teams are scheduled to play again later in the season, then the stopped game is decided by a \"two-possession shootout\" procedure held before the later game is started. The procedure is generally similar to overtime in the CFL, with two major exceptions: each team must play exactly two possessions regardless of what happens; and while the score from the stopped game is not added to the shootout score, it is used instead to determine the yard line where each team starts its possessions, so the team that was leading still has an advantage.[26]  The positions in Canadian football have evolved throughout the years, and are not officially defined in the rules. However, there are still several standard positions, as outlined below.  The offence must have at least seven players lined up along the line of scrimmage on every play. The players on either end (usually the wide receivers) are eligible to receive forward passes, and may be in motion along the line of scrimmage prior to the snap. The other players on the line of scrimmage (usually the offensive linemen) are ineligible to receive forward passes, and once they are in position, they may not move until the play begins.  Offensive positions fit into three general categories:  The primary roles of the offensive linemen (or down linemen) are to protect the quarterback so that he can pass, and to help block on running plays. Offensive linemen generally do not run with the ball (unless they recover it on a fumble) or receive a handoff or lateral pass, but there is no rule against it.  Offensive linemen include the following positions:  Backs are behind the linemen at the start of play. They may run with the ball, and receive handoffs, laterals, and forward passes. They may also be in motion before the play starts.  Backs include the following positions:  Receivers may start the play either on or behind the line of scrimmage. They may run with the ball, and receive handoffs, laterals, and forward passes.  Receivers include the following positions:  The rules do not constrain how the defence may arrange itself, other than the requirement that they must remain one yard behind the line of scrimmage until the play starts.  Defensive positions fit into three general categories:  Special teams are generally used on kicking plays, which include kickoffs, punts, field goal attempts, and extra point attempts. Special teams include the following positions: "},{"title":"Beach soccer","content":"Beach soccer, also known as beach football, sand football or beasal, is a variant of association football played on a beach or some form of sand.[2]  Football has long been played informally on beaches, but the introduction of beach soccer was an attempt to codify rules for the game in 1992 by the founders of Beach Soccer Worldwide, a company set up to develop the sport and responsible for the majority of its tournaments.[3]  The first international matches were played in 1993 for men and 2009 for women.[4][5] As of July 2023,[update] there are 193 men's and 64 women's clubs and 101 men's and 23 women's national teams sorted in the Beach Soccer Worldwide Rankings.[6]  Beach football (beasal or futebol de areia) started in Brazil, more precisely at Rio de Janeiro. In 1950 the first official tournament was created to unite neighborhood small tournaments that happened since 1940.[7] It has grown to be an international game. The participation of international players such as Eric Cantona, Michel, Julio Salinas, Rom\u00e1rio, J\u00fanior and Zico has helped to expand television coverage to audiences in over 170 countries.[citation needed]  Beach soccer had been played recreationally for years and in different formats. In 1992 the laws of the game were envisioned and a pilot event was staged by the founding partners of BSWW in Los Angeles and the sport was adopted by Beach Soccer Los Angeles in 2017 where the game is played all around Los Angeles County. By 1993, the first professional beach soccer competition was organized at Miami Beach with teams from the United States, Brazil, Argentina and Italy taking part.  In April 1994 the first event to be covered by network television transmissions was held on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro and the city hosted the first Beach Soccer World Championship in 1995. The competition was won by the host nation, making Brazil the first-ever World Champions of Beach Soccer. Commercial interest begin to match developments on the field and growing demand for the sport around the world gave rise to the Pro Beach Soccer Tour in 1996.  The first Pro Beach Soccer Tour included a total of 60 games in two years across South America, Europe, Asia and the United States. Interest generated by the tour in Europe led to the creation of the European Pro Beach Soccer League in 1998, providing a more solid infrastructure that would increase the professionalism of the spectacle. EPBSL, now known as the Euro BS League, brought promoters together from across the continent and satisfied the demands of the media, sponsors and fans. Four years on from its creation, the first step in the building of a legitimate worldwide competition structure for the sport of pro beach soccer had been taken.  Behind the scenes developments were also taking place, with the Beach Soccer Company relocating its headquarters to Europe firstly to Monaco and then Barcelona before becoming Pro Beach Soccer, S.L. in April 2000. One year later they would join forces with Octagon Koch Tavares (who had continued to organise the World Championships and events in South America) to form a single entity known as Beach Soccer Worldwide (BSWW) with the aim of unifying all major Pro Beach Soccer tournaments in the world under the same structure and providing representation of the sport to major sponsors, the media and FIFA.  FIFA became the global governing body of the sport in 2005, acknowledging BSWW's framework and organizing the first FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup.[8]  The next four years would see this growth consolidated by further progress both on and off the field. By 2004, some 17 nations had entered teams, with this number expected to rise to over[9] stage events.  Such interest has allowed BSWW to strike certain sponsorship deals with international companies including McDonald's, Coca-Cola and MasterCard, who stepped up their involvement in 2004 and are now title sponsors of the Euro BS League. Recognition has also come from FIFA who have cited BSWW as the major entity behind the creation and growth of Beach Soccer, forming a \"highly promising\" partnership that was \"in its full splendour\" seen in the 2005 world cup, held in Copacabana Beach, Brazil. France won the first world cup and the next year Brazil won it at the same venue. The World Cup has continued to flourish with the first held outside Brazil in 2008 and future World Cups spreading as far out as Tahiti in 2013 and Portugal in 2015.[10]  The Women's Euro Beach Soccer Cup and Women's Euro Winners Cup were first held in 2016, whereas the Women's Euro Beach Soccer League debuted in 2021. In addition, the 2019 World Beach Games had a women's beach soccer tournament, and a Women's Intercontinental Beach Soccer Cup was held in 2021. As of 2022, FIFA and the other five continental confederations do not host women's beach soccer tournaments. The Asian Beach Games, European Games and South American Beach Games also do not have women's beach soccer tournaments.  The rules of beach soccer are based on the Laws of the Game of association football, with some modifications.[11]  A beach soccer field is a level sandy area smaller than a regular association football pitch. The field is cleared of pebbles and seashells along with any other objects which could injure a player.  The field is rectangular in shape and the touch line is longer than the goal line. The field dimensions are:  The penalty area is within 9\u00a0m (9.8 yards) of the goals and is marked by a yellow flag situated in touch. Two red flags opposite each other are at the center of the field to represent the half-way line. The goals are smaller than their standard association football counterparts, being 2.2 metres (7\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) from the ground to the bottom of the crossbar and 5.5 metres (18\u00a0ft) in width between the inside of each upright.  Each team consists of five players including the goalkeeper and an unlimited number of substitutions, from a selection of three to five players. Throw-ins and kick-ins mean the pace and flow of the game can be faster than regular football. Shoes and socks are not allowed; players must play in bare feet, although ankle guards are permitted. Goal clearances (the equivalent of a goal kick) are taken by the goalkeeper using their hands to throw the ball and a goal cannot be scored directly from these.[12]  A game lasts 36 minutes and is split up into three 12-minute periods. Unlike association football, in professional matches the referee is not the sole arbiter of the end of a period. A separate timekeeping official controls the official game clock, which is stopped for stoppages in play and typically counts down to zero, as in North American sports such as basketball and ice hockey. Draws are not permitted, with the game going into three minutes of golden goal extra time followed by a penalty shoot-out if the score is still on level terms after normal time. Unlike normal football, penalty kicks are directly decided by sudden death rules; it was changed since 2014 to three kicks from the penalty mark are taken, and the team that has scored more wins. If it is not decided after three kicks from the penalty mark, the sudden death rules will then be applied.[13] Since 2021, the rules were changed again from three to five kicks from the penalty mark.  Beach soccer has two on-field referees who co-operatively referee the game. They are assisted by a third referee who acts in a manner similar to football's fourth official and a timekeeper.  As in football, yellow and red cards can be issued. Unlike in association football, the team can then bring on a substitute to replace the dismissed player after two minutes.[14] Similar to a power play in ice hockey, this period of numerical advantage ends early if the penalised team concedes a goal.  Free kicks are awarded for various fouls. All free kicks are direct free kicks which has to be taken by the player who was fouled, unless awarded for deliberate handling. The laws specify that all players apart from the opposing goalkeeper must clear a zone between the kicker and the goal. Penalties are awarded for fouls within the penalty area.  The following are some of the competitions:  AFC (Asian Football Confederation):  CAF (Confederation of African Football):  CONCACAF (Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football):  CONMEBOL (South American Football Confederation):  OFC (Oceania Football Confederation):  UEFA (Union of European Football Associations): "},{"title":"Futsal","content":"Futsal is a football-based game played on a hardcourt like a basketball court, smaller than a football pitch, and mainly indoors. It has similarities to five-a-side football and indoor football.[1]  Futsal is played between two teams of five players each, one of whom is the goalkeeper. Unlimited substitutions are permitted. Unlike some other forms of indoor football, it is played on a hard court surface marked by lines; walls or boards are not used. It is played with a smaller, harder, lower-bounce ball than association football.[2] The surface, ball and rules favour ball control and passing in small spaces.[3][4]  The game emphasizes control, improvisation, creativity and technique.[5]  Futsal comes from the Portuguese futebol de sal\u00e3o and from the Spanish f\u00fatbol sala or f\u00fatbol de sal\u00f3n (all translatable as \"indoor football\"). During its second world championships held in Madrid in 1985, the Spanish name f\u00fatbol sala was used. The World Futsal Association registered the name futsal in 1985, following a dispute with FIFA over the name f\u00fatbol. Since then, futsal has become the officially and internationally accepted name, and FIFA has also started using the term.  Futsal started in 1930 when Juan Carlos Ceriani, a teacher in Montevideo, Uruguay, created a version of indoor football for YMCAs.[6]  Originally developed for basketball courts,[7] a rule book for the new sport was published in September 1933. Association football was already highly popular in the country, and after Uruguay won the 1930 World Cup and gold medals in the 1924 and 1928 Summer Olympics, it attracted even more practitioners. Ceriani's goal was to create a team game similar to football that could be played indoors or outdoors.  While writing the rule book, Ceriani combined the principles of association football\u2014where the ball may be touched with every part of the body except the hands\u2014with rules from other sports: from basketball, the number of players (five per team) and the game's duration (40 active minutes); from water polo, the goalkeeping rules; and from team handball, the field and goal sizes.  The YMCA spread the game quickly throughout South America. It was easily played by everyone, everywhere, and in any weather condition, helping players of other sports stay in shape all year round. These reasons convinced Jo\u00e3o Lotufo, a Brazilian, to bring the game to his country and adapt it to the needs of physical education.  Initially, the rules were not uniform. In 1956, the rules were modified by Habib Maphuz and Luiz Gonzaga de Oliveira Fernandes within the YMCA of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, to allow seniors to compete. Luiz de Oliveira wrote the Book of Rules of Futsal in 1956, then adopted also at the international level.  In 1965, the Confederaci\u00f3n Sudamericana de Futsal (South American Futsal Confederation) was formed, consisting of Uruguay, Brazil, Paraguay, Peru and Argentina.  Shortly after, a tournament was organized. It attracted some interest in South American media, which regularly began to follow futsal. In particular, it was the Brazilian journalist Jos\u00e9 Ant\u00f4nio Ingl\u00eaz who passionately contributed to the rapid spread of the game, as well as being credited as the man who coined the name \"futsal\".[8]  The most attended futsal match in history was played on 7 September 2014 on Mane Garrincha Stadium in Brazil's capital Brasilia between Brazil and Argentina in front of 56,483 spectators.[9]  Today, futsal is a very popular global sport, with one source estimating 12 million players across the world.[10] Due to its easy setup, enhanced accessibility, and lower physical requirements, futsal has become an essential resource for coaches aiming to develop players.[11]  The two most important governing bodies of futsal are the Asociaci\u00f3n Mundial de F\u00fatsal (AMF) and F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). AMF is the successor organization to the original governing body. FIFA later took an interest in futsal. However, talks between FIFA and AMF to reconcile governance were not successful. FIFA organizes its own separate competitions.  The International Futsal Alliance (IFA) is a partnership of countries formed to offer high quality futsal tournaments throughout the world. It sees itself as ancillary rather than competing with FIFA. Its membership spans countries from North and South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. Several tournaments have been organized under the auspices of IFA, including a world cup for men held in 2019 and one for women held in 2017.[12]  Confederaci\u00f3n Sudamericana de Futsal (CPFS\/PANAFUTSAL)  There are currently two governing bodies: Asociaci\u00f3n Mundial de F\u00fatsal (AMF) and F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) which are responsible for maintaining and regulating the official rules of their respective versions of futsal.  FIFA publishes its futsal rules as the 'Laws of the Game', in which each of the 17 'laws' is a thematically related collection of individual regulations. The laws define all aspects of the game, including which may be changed to suit local competitions and leagues.[13]  Many of the laws are similar or identical to those found in association football, or reference association football in their absence (such as a section noting that there is no offside infraction in futsal). These rules are subjective and differ from tournament to tournament.  There are five players on the field on each team, one of whom is the goalkeeper. The maximum number of substitutes allowed is nine (FIFA change 2012), with unlimited substitutions during the match. Substitutes can come on even when the ball is in play but the player coming off must leave the field before the substitute can enter the playing field.[18] If a team has or is reduced to fewer than three players remaining, the match is abandoned and counted as a loss for the team with the lack of players.[19]  The kit is made up of a jersey or shirt with sleeves, shorts, socks, shinguards made out of metal, plastic or foam, and shoes with rubber soles. The goalkeeper is allowed to wear long trousers and a different coloured kit to distinguish themself from the other players on the team and the referee. The goalkeeper is also allowed to wear elbow pads because the surface is about as hard as a tennis court or basketball court. Jewellery is not allowed, nor are other items that could be dangerous to the player wearing the item or to other active participants.[20]  The match is controlled by the referee, who enforces the Laws of the Game, and the first referee is the only one who can legally abandon the match because of interference from outside the field. This referee is assisted by a second referee who typically watches over the goal lines or assists the primary referee with calls on fouls or plays. The decisions made by the referees are final and can only be changed if the referees think it is necessary and play has not restarted.[21] There is also a third referee and a timekeeper who are provided with equipment to keep a record of fouls in the match. In the event of injury to the second referee, the third referee will replace the second referee.[22]  The futsal court is made up of wood or artificial material, or similar surface, although any flat, smooth and non-abrasive material may be used. The length of the field is in the range of 38\u201342\u00a0m (125\u2013138\u00a0ft), and the width is in the range of 20\u201325\u00a0m (66\u201382\u00a0ft) in international matches. For other matches, it can be 25\u201342\u00a0m (82\u2013138\u00a0ft) in length, while the width can be 16\u201325\u00a0m (52\u201382\u00a0ft), as long as the length of the longer boundary lines (touchlines) are greater than the shorter boundaries where the goals are placed (goal lines) (Basketball courts of 28\u00a0m \u00d7\u00a015\u00a0m (92\u00a0ft \u00d7\u00a049\u00a0ft) can be used). The \"standard\" size court for an international is 40\u00a0m \u00d7\u00a020\u00a0m (131\u00a0ft \u00d7\u00a066\u00a0ft) (the size of a handball field).[23] The ceiling must be at least 4\u00a0m (13\u00a0ft) high.[24]  A rectangular goal is positioned at the middle of each goal line. The inner edges of the vertical goal posts must be 3\u00a0m (9.8\u00a0ft) apart, and the lower edge of the horizontal crossbar supported by the goal posts must be 2\u00a0m (6.6\u00a0ft) above the ground. Nets made of hemp, jute or nylon are attached to the back of the goalposts and crossbar. The lower part of the nets is attached to curved tubing or another suitable means of support. The depth of the goal is 80\u00a0cm (31\u00a0in) at the top and 1\u00a0m (3.3\u00a0ft) at the bottom.[25]  In front of each goal is an area known as the penalty area. This area is created by drawing quarter-circles with a 6\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft) radius from the goal line, centered on the goalposts. The upper part of each quarter-circle is then joined by a 3.16\u00a0m (10.4\u00a0ft) line running parallel to the goal line between the goalposts. The line marking the edge of the penalty area is known as the penalty area line.[26] The penalty area marks where the goalkeeper is allowed to touch the ball with hands. The penalty mark is six metres from the goal line when it reaches the middle of the goalposts. The second penalty mark is 10 metres (33\u00a0ft) from the goal line when it reaches the middle of the goalposts. A penalty kick from the penalty spot is awarded if a player commits a foul inside the penalty area.[27] The second penalty spot is used if a player commits their team's sixth foul in the opposing team's half or in their own half in the area bordered by the halfway line and an imaginary line parallel to the halfway line passing through the second penalty mark; the free kick is taken from the second penalty mark.[28]  Any standard team handball field can be used for futsal, including goals and floor markings.  A standard match consists of two equal periods of 20 minutes. The length of either half is extended to allow penalty kicks to be taken or a direct free kick to be taken against a team that has committed more than five fouls. The interval between the two halves cannot exceed 15 minutes.[29]  In some competitions, the game cannot end in a draw, so away goals, extra time and kicks from the penalty mark are the three methods for determining the winner after a match has been drawn. Away goals mean that if the team's score is level after playing one home and one away game, the team which has scored more away goals wins. Extra time consists of two periods of five minutes. If no winner is produced after these methods, three kicks from the penalty mark are taken, and the team that has scored the most wins. If it is not decided after three kicks from the penalty mark, it continues to go on with one extra kick from the penalty mark to each team at a time until one of them has scored more goals than the other. Unlike extra time, the goals scored in a shoot-out do not count towards the goals scored throughout the match.[30]  At the beginning of the match, a coin toss is used to decide who will start the match. A kick-off is used to signal the start of play and is used at the start of the second half and any periods of extra time. It is also used after a goal has been scored, with the other team starting the play.[31] After a temporary stoppage for any reason not mentioned in the Laws of the Game, the referee will drop the ball where the play was stopped, provided that, before the stoppage, the ball was in play and had not crossed either the touch lines or goal lines.[32]  If the ball goes over the goal line or touchline, hits the ceiling, or the play is stopped by the referee, the ball is out of play. If it hits the ceiling of an indoor arena, play is restarted with a kick-in to the opponents of the team that last touched the ball, under the place where it hit the ceiling.[24]  Unlike association football, there is no offside in futsal. Under the Futsal Laws of the Game, Law 11 references offside as it does in association football, but only says that there is no offside in futsal.[33]  A direct free kick can be awarded to the opposing team if a player succeeds or attempts to kick or trip an opponent, jumps, charges or pushes an opponent, or strikes or attempts to strike an opponent. Holding, touching or spitting at an opponent are offenses that are worthy of a direct free kick, as are sliding in to play the ball while an opponent is playing it or carrying, striking or throwing the ball (except the goalkeeper).  These are all accumulated fouls. After five accumulated fouls in a half, the sixth accumulated foul and beyond result in a direct kick from the penalty mark where members of both teams may not make a wall prior to the kick.  The direct free kick is taken where the infringement occurred, unless it is awarded to the defending team in their penalty area, in which case the free kick may be taken from anywhere inside the penalty area.[34] A penalty kick is awarded if a player commits one of the fouls that are worthy of a direct free kick inside their own penalty area. The position of the ball does not matter as long as it is in play but for a penalty kick, the ball must be on the outer line, perpendicular to the center of the net.[35]  An indirect free kick is awarded to the opposing team if a goalkeeper clears the ball but then touches it with their hands before anyone else, if the goalkeeper controls the ball with hands when it has been kicked to them by a teammate, or if they touch or control the ball with hands or feet in their own half for more than four seconds.[35]  An indirect free kick is also awarded to the opposing team if a player plays in a dangerous manner, deliberately obstructs an opponent, prevents the goalkeeper from throwing the ball with hands or anything else for which play is stopped to caution or dismiss a player. The indirect free kick is taken from the place where the infringement occurred.[35]  Yellow and red cards are used in futsal. The yellow card is to caution players over their actions. If they get two, they are given a red card, which means they are sent off the field. A yellow card is shown if a player shows unsporting behavior, dissent, persistent infringement of the Laws of the Game, delaying the restart of play, failing to respect the distance of the player from the ball when play is being restarted, infringement of substitution procedure or entering, re-entering and leaving the field without the referee's permission.[36] A player is shown the red card and sent off if they engage in serious foul play, violent conduct, spitting at another person, or denying the opposing team a goal by handling the ball (except the goalkeeper inside their penalty area). Also punishable with a red card is denying an opponent moving towards the player's goal a goal scoring opportunity by committing an offense punishable by a free kick or a penalty kick and using offensive, insulting or abusive language or gestures.[36] A player who has been sent off must leave the vicinity of the field.[citation needed]  A substitute player is permitted to come on two minutes after a teammate has been sent off, unless a goal is scored before the end of the two minutes. If a team with more players scores against a team with fewer players, another player can be added to the team with an inferior number of players. If the teams are equal when the goal is scored or if the team with fewer players scores, both teams remain with the same number of players.[citation needed]  There is currently no official futsal ranking.As of 19\u00a0April\u00a02024[update], the top 30 teams according to one Elo-based ranking system are:[37]  [38]  Calculate function   where:  As of 23\u00a0October\u00a02022[update], according to a ranking based partly on the Elo system, the top 10 teams are:[39]  http:\/\/old.futsalplanet.com\/agenda\/agenda-01.asp?id=18770  ^n\/a  A round-robin tournament determined the final standings.  5th European Universities Championship 14-19\/7\/2008 Wroclaw (Poland)  http:\/\/old.futsalplanet.com\/agenda\/agenda-01.asp?id=9256  CFA Futsal International Tournaments - Changshu Story  ^n\/a  A round-robin tournament determined the final standings.

Sometimes, the word \"athlete\" is used to refer specifically to sport of athletics competitors, i.e. including track and field and marathon runners but excluding e.g. swimmers, footballers or basketball players. However in other contexts (mainly in the United States) it is used to refer to all athletics (physical culture) participants of any sport. For the latter definition, the word sportsperson or its gendered sportsman or sportswoman are also used. A third definition is also sometimes used meaning anyone who is physically fit regardless of whether or not they compete in a sport.[1][2]  Athletes may be professionals or amateurs.[3] Most professional athletes have particularly well-developed physiques obtained by extensive physical training and strict exercise, accompanied by a strict dietary regimen.  The word \"athlete\" is a romanization of the Greek: \u03ac\u03b8\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u1f74\u03c2, athl\u0113t\u0113s, meaning one who participates in a contest; from \u1f04\u03b8\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, \u00e1thlos or \u1f04\u03b8\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd, \u00e1thlon, meaning a contest or feat. The primary definition of \"sportsman\" according to Webster's Third Unabridged Dictionary (1960) is, \"a person who is active in sports: as  (a): one who engages in the sports of the field and especially in hunting or fishing.\"  Athletes involved in isotonic exercises have an increased mean left ventricular end-diastolic volume and are less likely to be depressed.[4][5] Due to their strenuous physical activities, athletes are far more likely than the general population to visit massage salons and pay for services from massotherapists and masseurs.[6] Athletes whose sport requires endurance more than strength usually have a lower calorie intake than other athletes.[7]  While athleticism is largely influenced by environmental factors, it has been theorized that genetic expression may play a moderate role in an athlete's abilities as well.[8] Exploring this claim, meta-analyses of studies regarding two specific genes, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene and ACTN3, concluded that certain variations in expression may have a moderate effect on athletic performance; the former being more prevalent in endurance-based events and the latter in power-based events.[9][10] Further studies on these and other genetic polymorphisms linked to athletic performance were recommended.  An \"all-round athlete\" is a person who competes in multiple sports at a professional level. Examples of people who played more than one sport professionally include Jim Thorpe, Lionel Conacher, Deion Sanders, Danny Ainge, Babe Zaharias and Erin Phillips. Others include Ricky Williams, Bo Jackson and Damon Allen, each of whom was drafted both by Major League Baseball and by professional gridiron football leagues such as the NFL and the CFL. Another female example is Heather Moyse, a multiple Winter Olympic gold medalist in bobsled and member of the World Rugby Hall of Fame who also represented Canada internationally in track cycling and competed at university level in basketball and track and field. Japanese athletes such as Kazushi Sakuraba, Kazuyuki Fujita, Masakatsu Funaki and Naoya Ogawa have successfully performed in professional wrestling and competed in mixed martial arts.  The title of \"World's Greatest Athlete\" traditionally belongs to the world's top competitor in the decathlon (males) and heptathlon (females) in track and field. The decathlon consists of 10 events: 100 meters, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400 meters, 110 m hurdles, discus, pole vault, javelin, and 1500 m. The heptathlon consists of seven events: the 100 m hurdles, high jump, shot put, 200 meters, long jump, javelin, and 800 meters. These competitions require an athlete to possess the whole spectrum of athletic ability in order to be successful, including speed, strength, coordination, jumping ability, and endurance.  Although the title \"World's Greatest Athlete\" seems a natural fit for these two events, its traditional association with the decathlon\/heptathlon officially began with Jim Thorpe. During the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden, Thorpe won the gold medal in the Decathlon (among others). Thorpe competed professionally in baseball, American football, and basketball; and competed collegiately in track and field, baseball, lacrosse, and did ballroom dancing. King Gustav V of Sweden, while awarding Thorpe the decathlon gold, said: \"Sir, you are the greatest athlete in the world.\"[11] This title has been associated with the decathlon event ever since. "},{"title":"Belfast","content":"  Belfast (\/\u02c8b\u025blf\u00e6st\/ \u24d8 BEL-fast, \/-f\u0251\u02d0st\/ -\u2060fahst[a] (from Irish: B\u00e9al Feirste [b\u02b2e\u02d0l\u02e0 \u02c8f\u02b2\u025b\u027e\u02e0(\u0259)\u0283t\u02b2\u0259]))[5][6] is the capital city and principal port of Northern Ireland, standing on the banks of the River Lagan and connected to the open sea through Belfast Lough and the North Channel. It is second to Dublin as the largest city on the island of Ireland with a population in 2021 of 345,418[7] and a metro area population of 671,559.[8]  Established as an English settlement early in the 17th century, its growth was driven by an influx of Scottish-descendant Presbyterians. Their disaffection with Ireland's Anglican establishment contributed to the rebellion of 1798, and to the union with Great Britain\u2014later regarded as a key to the town's industrial transformation. When granted city status in 1888, Belfast was the world's largest centre of linen manufacture, and by the 1900s her shipyards were building up to a quarter of total United Kingdom tonnage.  Sectarian tensions accompanied the growth of an Irish Catholic population drawn by mill and factory employment from western districts. Heightened by division over Ireland's future in the United Kingdom, these twice erupted in periods of sustained violence: in 1920-22, as Belfast emerged as the capital of the six northeast counties retaining the British connection, and over three decades from the late 1960s during which the British Army was continually deployed on the streets. A legacy of conflict is the barrier-reinforced separation of Protestant and Catholic working-class districts.  Since the 1998 Belfast Agreement, the electoral balance in the once unionist-controlled city has shifted, albeit with no overall majority, in favour of Irish nationalists. At the same time, new immigrants are adding to the growing number of residents unwilling to identify with either of the two communal traditions.  Belfast has seen significant services sector growth, with important contributions from financial technology (fintech), from tourism and, with facilities in the redeveloped Harbour Estate, from film. It retains a port with commercial and industrial docks, including a reduced Harland & Wolff shipyard and aerospace and defence contractors. Post Brexit, Belfast and Northern Ireland remain, uniquely, within both the British domestic and European Single trading areas for goods.  The city is served by two airports: George Best Belfast City Airport on the Lough shore and Belfast International Airport 15 miles (24 kilometres) west of the city. It supports two universities: on the north-side of the city centre, Ulster University, and on the southside the longer established Queens University. Since 2021, Belfast has been a UNESCO designated City of Music.  The name Belfast derives from the Irish B\u00e9al Feirste (Irish pronunciation: [b\u02b2e\u02d0l\u02e0 \u02c8f\u02b2\u025b\u027e\u02e0(\u0259)\u0283t\u02b2\u0259]),[6] \"Mouth of the Farset\"[9] a river whose name in the Irish, Feirste, refers to a sandbar or tidal ford.[10] This was formed where the river ran\u2014until culverted late in the 18th century, down High Street\u2014[11] into Lagan. It was at this crossing, located under or close to the current Queen's Bridge, that the early settlement developed.[12]:\u200a74\u201377\u200a  The compilers of Ulster-Scots use various transcriptions of local pronunciations of \"Belfast\" (with which they sometimes are also content)[13][14] including Bilfawst,[15][16] Bilfaust[17] or Baelfawst.[18]  The site of Belfast has been occupied since the Bronze Age. The Giant's Ring, a 5,000-year-old henge, is located near the city,[12]:\u200a42\u201345\u200a[19] and the remains of Iron Age hill forts can still be seen in the surrounding hills.  At the beginning of the 14th century, Papal tax rolls record two churches: at Kock in the east,  the \"Chapel of Dundela\",[20] connected by some accounts to the 7th-century evangelist St. Colmcille,[21]:\u200a11\u200aand, the \"Chapel of the Ford\", which may have been a successor to a much older parish church on the present Shankill (Seanchill, \"Old Church\") Road,[12]:\u200a63\u201364\u200a dating back to the 9th,[22] and possibly to St. Patrick in the mid 5th, century.[23]  A Norman settlement at the ford, comprising the parish church (now St. George's), a watermill, and a small fort,[24] was an outpost of Carrickfergus Castle. Established in the late 12th century, 11 miles (18\u00a0km) out along the north shore of the Lough, Carrickfergus was to remain the principal English foothold in the north-east until the scorched- earth Nine Years' War at the end of the 16th century broke the remaining Irish power, the O'Neills.[25]  With a commission from James I, in 1613 Sir Arthur Chichester undertook the Plantation of Belfast and the surrounding area, attracting mainly English and Manx settlers.[26] The subsequent arrival of Scottish Presbyterians embroiled Belfast in its only recorded siege: denounced from London by John Milton as \"ungrateful and treacherous guests\",[27] in 1649 the newcomers were temporarily expelled by an English Parliamentarian army.[28]:\u200a21\u200a[29] In 1689, Catholic Jacobite forces, briefly in command of the town,[30] abandoned it in advance of the landing at Carrickfergus of William, Prince of Orange, who proceeded through the Belfast to his celebrated victory on 12 July 1690 at the Boyne.[31]   Together with French Huguenots, the Scots introduced the production of linen, a flax-spinning industry that in the 18th century carried Belfast trade to the Americas.[32] Fortunes were made carrying rough linen clothing and salted provisions to the slave plantations of the West Indies; sugar and rum to Baltimore and New York; and for the return to Belfast flaxseed and tobacco from the colonies.[33] From the 1760s, profits from the trade financed improvements in the town's commercial infrastructure, including the Lagan Canal, new docks and quays, and the construction of the White Linen Hall which together attracted to Belfast the linen trade that had formerly gone through Dublin. Abolitionist sentiment, however, defeated the proposal of the greatest of the merchant houses, Cunningham and Greg, in 1786 to commission ships for the Middle Passage.[34] As \"Dissenters\" from the established Anglican church (with its episcopacy and ritual), Presbyterians were conscious of sharing, if only in part, the disabilities of Ireland's dispossessed Roman Catholic majority; and of being denied representation in the Irish Parliament. Belfast's two MPs remained nominees of the Chichesters (Marquesses of Donegall). With their emigrant kinsmen in America, the region's Presbyterians were to share a growing disaffection from the Crown[35]:\u200a55\u201361\u200a[36]  When early in the American War of Independence, Belfast Lough was raided by the privateer John Paul Jones, the townspeople assembled their own Volunteer militia. Formed ostensibly for defence of the Kingdom, Volunteer corps were soon pressing their own protest against \"taxation without representation\". Further emboldened by the French Revolution, a more radical element in the town, the Society of United Irishmen, called for Catholic emancipation and a representative national government.[37] In hopes of French assistance, in 1798 the Society organised a republican insurrection. The rebel tradesmen and tenant farmers were defeated north of the town at the Battle of Antrim and to the south at the Battle of Ballynahinch.[38]  Britain seized on the rebellion to abolish the Irish Parliament, unlamented in Belfast, and to incorporate Ireland in a United Kingdom.[39] In 1832, British parliamentary reform permitted the town its first electoral contest[40] \u2013  an occasion for an early and lethal sectarian riot.[41]:\u200a87\u200a  While other Irish towns experienced a loss of manufacturing, and after a cotton boom and bust, from the 1820s Belfast underwent rapid industrial expansion. As the global leader in the production of linen goods\u2014mill, and finishing, work largely employing women and children\u2014[42] it won the moniker \"Linenopolis\".[43] Shipbuilding led the development of heavier industry.[44] By the 1900s, her shipyards were building up to a quarter of the total United Kingdom tonnage.[45] This included from the yard of Harland & Wolff the ill-fated RMS Titanic, at the time of her launch in 1911 the largest ship afloat.[46] Other major export industries included textile machinery, rope, tobacco and mineral waters.[21]:\u200a59\u201388\u200a  Industry drew in a new Catholic population settling largely in the west of the town\u2014refugees from a rural poverty intensified by Belfast's mechanisation of spinning and weaving and, in the 1840s, by famine.[47] The plentiful supply of cheap labour helped attract English and Scottish capital to Belfast, but it was also a cause of insecurity.[48] Protestant workers organised and dominated the apprenticed trades[49] and gave a new lease of life to the once largely rural Orange Order.[50][51] Sectarian tensions, which frequently broke out in riots and workplace expulsions, were also driven by the \"constitutional question\": the prospect of a restored Irish parliament in which Protestants (and northern industry) feared being a minority interest.[49]  On 28 September 1912, unionists massed at Belfast's City Hall to sign the Ulster Covenant, pledging to use \"all means which may be found necessary to defeat the present conspiracy to set up a Home Rule Parliament in Ireland\".[52] This was followed by the drilling and eventual arming of a 100,000-strong Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF).[53] The immediate crisis was averted by the onset of the Great War. The UVF formed the 36th (Ulster) Division whose sacrifices in the Battle of the Somme continue to be commemorated in the city by unionist and loyalist organisations.[54]  In 1920\u201322, as Belfast emerged as the capital of the six counties remaining as Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom, there was widespread violence. 8,000 \"disloyal\" workers  were driven from their jobs in the shipyards:[55] in addition to Catholics, \"rotten Prods\" \u2013 Protestants whose labour politics disregarded sectarian distinctions.[56]:\u200a104\u2013108\u200a Gunbattles, grenade attacks and house burnings contributed to as many as 500 deaths.[57]  A curfew remained in force until 1924.[58] The lines drawn saw off the challenge to \"unionist unity\" posed by labour (industry had been paralysed by strikes in 1907 and again in 1919).[59] Until \"troubles\" returned at the end of the 1960s, it was not uncommon in Belfast for the Ulster Unionist Party to have its council and parliamentary candidates returned unopposed.[60][61]  In 1932, the opening of the new buildings for Northern Ireland's devolved Parliament at Stormont[62] was overshadowed by the protests of the unemployed and ten days of running street battles with the police. The government conceded increases in Outdoor Relief, but labour unity was short lived.[41]:\u200a219\u2013220\u200a In 1935, celebrations of King George V's Jubilee and of the annual Twelfth were followed by deadly riots and expulsions, a sectarian logic that extended itself to the interpretation of darkening events in Europe.[41]:\u200a226\u2013233\u200a Labour candidates found their support for the anti-clerical Spanish Republic characterised as another instance of No-Popery.[63] (Today, the cause of the republic in the Spanish Civil War is commemorated by a \"No Pasaran\" stained glass window in City Hall).[64]  In 1938, nearly a third of industrial workers were unemployed, malnutrition was a major issue, and at 9.6% the city's infant mortality rate (compared with 5.9% in Sheffield, England) was among the highest in United Kingdom.[65]  In the spring of 1941, the German Luftwaffe appeared twice over Belfast. In addition to the shipyards and the Short & Harland aircraft factory, the Belfast Blitz severely damaged or destroyed more than half the city's housing stock, and devastated the old town centre around High Street.[66] In the greatest loss of life in any air raid outside of London, more than a thousand people were killed.[67]  At the end of World War II, the Unionist government undertook programmes of \"slum clearance\" (the Blitz had exposed the \"uninhabitable\" condition of much of the city's housing) which involved decanting populations out of mill and factory built red-brick terraces and into new peripheral housing estates.[68][69] At the same time, a British-funded  welfare state \"revolutionised access\" to education and health care.[70] The resulting rise in expectations; together with the uncertainty caused by the decline of the city's Victorian-era industries, contributed to growing protest, and counter protest, in the 1960s over the Unionist government's record on civil and political rights.[71]  For reasons that nationalists and unionists dispute,[72] the public protests of the late 1960s soon gave way to communal violence (in which as many as 60,000 people were intimidated from their homes)[73]:\u200a70\u200a and to loyalist and republican paramilitarism. Introduced onto the streets in August 1969, the British Army committed to the longest continuous deployment in its history, Operation Banner. Beginning in 1970 with the Falls curfew, and followed in 1971 by internment, this included counterinsurgency measures directed chiefly at the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) who characterised their operations, including the bombing of Belfast's commercial centre, as a struggle against British occupation.[74][75]  Preceded by loyalist and republican ceasefires, the 1998 \"Good Friday\" Belfast Agreement returned a new power-sharing legislative assembly and executive to Stormont.[76] In the intervening years in Belfast, some 20,000 people had been injured, and 1,500 killed.[73]:\u200a73\u200a[77]  Eighty-five percent of the conflict-related deaths had occurred within 1,000 metres of the communal interfaces, largely in the north and west of the city.[73]:\u200a73\u200a The security barriers erected at these interfaces are an enduring physical legacy of the Troubles.[78] The 14 neighbourhoods they separate are among the 20 most deprived wards in Northern Ireland.[79] In May 2013, the Northern Ireland Executive committed to the removal of all peace lines by mutual consent.[80][81] The target date of 2023 was passed with only a small number dismantled.[82][83]  The more affluent districts escaped the worst of the violence, but the city centre was a major target. This was especially so during the first phase of the PIRA campaign in the early 1970s, when the organisation hoped to secure quick political results through maximum destruction.[78]:\u200a331\u2013332\u200a Including car bombs and incendiaries, between 1969 and 1977 the city experienced 2,280 explosions.[28]:\u200a58\u200a In addition to the death and injury caused, they accelerated the loss of the city's Victorian fabric.[84]  Since the turn of the century, the loss of employment and population in the city centre has been reversed.[85] This reflects the growth of the service economy, for which a new district has been developed on former dockland, the Titanic Quarter. The growing tourism sector paradoxically lists as attractions the murals and peace walls that echo the violence of the past.[78]:\u200a350.352\u200a In recent years, \"Troubles tourism\"[35]:\u200a180\u2013189\u200a has presented visitors with new territorial markers: flags, murals and graffiti in which loyalists and republicans take opposing sides in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.[86]  The demographic balance of some areas has been changed by immigration (according to the 2021 census just under 10% of the city's population was born outside the British Isles),[87] by local differences in births and deaths between Catholics and Protestants, and by a growing number of, particularly younger, people no longer willing to self-identify on traditional lines.[69]  In 1997, unionists lost overall control of Belfast City Council for the first time in its history. The election in 2011 saw Irish nationalist councillors outnumber unionist councillors for the first time, with Sinn F\u00e9in becoming the largest party, and the cross-community Alliance Party holding the balance of power.[88]   In the 2016 Brexit referendum, Belfast's four parliamentary constituencies returned a substantial majority (60 percent) for remaining within the European Union, as did Northern Ireland as a whole (55.8), the only UK region outside London and Scotland to do so.[89] In February 2022, the Democratic Unionist Party, which had actively campaigned for Brexit, withdrew from the power-sharing executive and collapsed the Stormont institutions to protest the 2020 UK-EU Northern Ireland Protocol. With the promise of equal access to the British and European markets, this designates Belfast as a point of entry to the European Single Market within whose regulatory framework local producers will continue to operate.[90] After two years, the standoff was resolved with an agreement to eliminate routine checks on UK-destined goods.[91] Belfast is at the mouth of the River Lagan at the head of Belfast Lough open through the North Channel to the Irish Sea and to the North Atlantic. In the course of the 19th century, the location's estuarine features were re-engineered. With dredging and reclamation, the lough was made to accommodate a deep sea port, and extensive shipyards.[92] The lagan was banked (in 1994 a weir raised its water level to cover what remained of the tidal mud flats)[93] and its various tributaries were culverted[94] (on the model pioneered in 2008 by the Connswater Community Greenway some are now being considered for \"daylighting\").[95]  It remains the case that much of the city centre is built on an estuarine bed of \"sleech\": silt, peat, mud and\u2014a source the city's ubiquitous red brick\u2014 soft clay, that presents a challenge for high-rise construction.[96] (It was this soft foundation that persuaded St Anne's Cathedral to abandon plans for a bell tower and, in 2007, to substitute a lightweight steel spire).[97] The city centre is also subject to tidal flood risk. Rising sea levels could mean, that without significant investment, flooding in the coming decades will be persistent.[98]  The city is overlooked on the County Antrim side (to the north and northwest) by a precipitous basalt escarpment\u2014the near continuous line of Divis Mountain (478m), Black Mountain (389m) and Cavehill (368m)\u2014whose \"heathery slopes and hanging fields are visible from almost any part  of the city\".[92]:\u200a13\u200a From County Down side (on the south and south east) it is flanked by the lower-lying Castlereagh and Hollywood hills. The sand and gravel Malone Ridge extends up river to the south-west.  From 1820, Belfast began to spread rapidly beyond its 18th century limits. To the north, it stretched out along roads which drew into the town migrants from Scots-settled hinterland of County Antrim.[48] Largely Presbyterian, they enveloped a number of Catholic-occupied \u201cmill-row\u201d clusters: New Lodge, Ardoyne and \"the Marrowbone\".[99][100] Together with areas of more substantial housing in the Oldpark district, these are wedged between Protestant working-class housing stretching from Tiger's Bay out the Shore Road on one side, and up the Shankill (the original Antrim Road) on the other.[101]  The Greater Shankill area, including Crumlin and Woodvale, is over the line from the Belfast North parliamentary\/assembly constituency, but is physically separated from the rest of Belfast West by an extensive series of separation barriers[102]\u2014peace walls\u2014owned (together with five daytime gates into the Falls area) by the Department of Justice.[103] These include Cupar Way where tourists are informed that, at 45 feet, the barrier is \"three times higher than the Berlin Wall and has been in place for twice as long\".[104]  With other working-class districts, Shankill suffered from the \"collapse of old industrial Belfast\".[105] But it was also greatly affected from the 1960s by the city's most ambitious programme of \"slum clearance\". Red-brick, \"two up, two down\" terraced streets, typical of 19th century working-class housing, were replaced with flats, maisonettes, and car parks but few facilities. In a period of twenty years, due largely to redevelopment, 50,000 residents left the area leaving an aging population of 26,000[106][105] and more than 100 acres of wasteland.[107]  Meanwhile, road schemes, including the terminus of the M1 motorway and the Westlink, demolished a mixed dockland community, Sailortown and severed the streets linking the Shankill area and the rest of both north and west Belfast to the city centre.[108][109]  New \"green field\" housing estates were built on the outer edges of the city. The onset of the Troubles overwhelmed attempts to promote these as \"mixed\" neighbourhoods so that the largest of these developments on the city's northern edge, Rathcoole rapidly solidified as a loyalist community.[110] In 2004, it was estimated that 98% of public housing in Belfast was divided along religious lines.[111]  Among the principal landmarks of north Belfast are the Crumlin Road Gaol (1845) now a major visitor attraction, the Clonard Monastery, (1890), the Waterworks Park (1889), and Belfast Zoo (1934).  In the mid-19th century rural poverty and famine drove large numbers of Catholic tenant farmers, landless labourers and their families toward Belfast. Their route brought them down Falls Road and into what are now remnants of an older Catholic enclave around St Mary's Church, the town's first Catholic chapel (opened in 1784 with Presbyterian subscriptions),[112] and Smithfield Market.[48] Eventually an entire west side of the city, stretching up the Falls Road and out passed Andersonstown, and encompassing the new housing estates built 1950s and 60s along the Springfield Road (Highfield, New Barnsley, Ballymurphy, Whiterock and Turf Lodge) became near-exclusively Catholic and in political terms nationalist.  Reflecting the nature of available employment as mill workers, domestics and shop assistants, the population, initially, was disproportionately female. Further opportunities for women on Falls Road arose through developments in education and public health. In 1900, the Dominican Order opened St Mary's [Teacher] Training College, and in 1903 King Edward VII opened the Royal Victoria Hospital at the junction with the Grosvenor Road.[113] Extensively redeveloped and expanded, the hospital has a staff of more than 8,500.[114]  Landmarks in the area include the Gothic-revival St Peter's Cathedral (1866, signature twin spires added in 1886);[115] the Conway Mill (1853\/1901, re-developed as a community enterprise, arts and education centre in 1983);[116] St Malachy's College (1833) and, best known for its republican graves, Milltown Cemetery (1869).  The areas greatest visitor attraction are its wall and gable-end murals. In contrast to those to those in loyalist areas, where Israel is typically the only outside reference, these range more freely beyond the local conflict frequently expressing solidarity with Palestinians, with Cuba, and with Basque and Catalan separatists.[117][118]  West Belfast is separated from South Belfast, and from the otherwise abutting loyalist districts of Sandy Row and the Donegall Road, by rail lines, the MI Motorway (to Dublin and the west); industrial and retail parks, and the remnants of the Blackstaff (Owenvarra) bog meadows.  Belfast began stretching up-river in the 1840s and 50s: out the Ormeau and Lisburn roads and, between them, running along a ridge of higher ground, the Malone Road. From \"leafy\" avenues of increasingly substantial (and in the course of time \u201cmixed\") housing, the Upper Malone broadened out into areas of parkland and villas.  Further out still, where they did not survive as public parks, from the 1960s the great-house demesnes of the city's former mill-owners and industrialists, were developed for public housing:  loyalist estates such as Seymour Hill and Belvoir. Meanwhile, in Malone and along the river embankments, new houses and apartment blocks have been squeezed in, increasing the general housing density.[119]  Beyond the Queens University area the area's principal landmarks are the 15-storey tower block of Belfast City Hospital (1986) on the Lisburn Road, and the Lagan Valley Regional Park through which a towpath extends from the City-centre quayside to Lisburn.[120]  Northern Ireland's three permanent diplomatic missions are situated on the Malone Road, the consulates of China,[121] Poland [122] and the United States.[123]  The first district on the right bank of the Lagan (the County Down side) to be incorporated in Belfast was Ballymacarrett after 1868.[41][124] Harland and Wolff, whose gantry cranes \"Samson & Goliath\" tower over the area, was long the mainstay of employment\u2014although less securely so for the townland's Catholics (In 1970, when the yard still had a workforce of 10,000, only 400 Catholics were employed).[41]:\u200a280\u200a Tolerated in periods of expansion as navvies and casual labourers,[56]:\u200a87\u201388\u200a they concentrated in a small enclave, the Short Strand, which has continued into this century to feature as sectarian flashpoint.[125][126] Home to around 2,500 people, it is the only distinctly nationalist area in the east of the river.[127]  East Belfast developed from the Queens Bridge (1843), through Ballymacarrett, east along the Newtownards Road and north (along the east shore of the Lough) up the Holywood Road; and from the Albert Bridge (1890) south east out the Cregagh and Castlereagh roads. The further out, the more substantial, and less religiously segregated, the housing until again encountering the city's outer ring of public housing estates: loyalist Knocknagoney, Lisnasharragh, and Tullycarnet.  This century, efforts have been made to add to East Belfast's two obvious visitor attractions: Samson & Goliath (the \"banana yellow cranes\" date only from the early 1970s)[56]:\u200a79\u200a and the Parliament Buildings at Stormont. What is marketed now as EastSide, features, at the intersection of the Connswater and Comber Greenways and next to the EastSide Visitor Centre, CS Lewis Square (2017), named and themed in honour of the local author of The Chronicles of Narnia.[128]  Next to the former the Harland & Wolff Drawing Offices (now an hotel), stands the \"cultural nucleus to Titanic Quarter\", Titanic Belfast (2012) whose interactive galleries tell the liner's ill-fated story.[129]  Belfast City Centre is roughly bounded by the ring roads constructed since the 1970s: the M3 which sweeps across the dockland to the north; the Westlink that connects to the M1 for points south and west; and, with less certainty, the Bruce Street and Bankmore connectors that tie back toward the Lagan at the Gasworks Business Park and the beginning of the Ormeau Road. This embraces \"the Markets\", the one remaining inner-city area of housing.[130] Of the various markets, including those for the sale and shipping of livestock, from which it derives its name, only one survives, the former produce market, St George's,[131] now a food and craft market popular with visitors to the city.[132]  Among surviving elements of the pre-Victorian town are the Belfast Entries, 17th-century alleyways off High Street, including, in Winecellar Entry, White's Tavern (rebuilt 1790); the elliptical First Presbyterian (Non-Subscribing) Church (1781\u201383) in Rosemary Street (whose members led the abolitionist charge against Greg and Cunningham);[133] the Assembly Rooms (1769, 1776, 1845) on Bridge Street; St George's Church of Ireland (1816) on the High Street site of the old Corporation Church; and (although cut off by arterial roads) the oldest public building in Belfast, Clifton House (1771\u201374), the Belfast Charitable Society poorhouse on North Queen Street. In addition there are small sets of city-centre Georgian terraces.[134]  Of the much larger Victorian city a substantial legacy has survived the Blitz, The Troubles and planning and development. Among the more notable examples[134] are St Malachy's Roman Catholic Church (1844) and the original college building of Queen's University Belfast (1849), both in a Tudor style; the Palm House in the Botanic Gardens (1852); the Renaissance revival Union Theological College (1853) and Ulster Bank (now Merchant Hotel) (1860); the Italianate Ulster Hall (1862), and the National Trust restored ornate Crown Liquor Saloon (1885, 1898) (a setting for the classic film, Odd Man Out, starring James Mason);[135]  the oriental-themed Grand Opera House (1895) (bombed several times during the Troubles);[136] and the Renaissance and Baroque revival Scottish Provident Institution (1902),  The Baroque revival City Hall was finished in 1906 on the site of the former White Linen Hall, and was built to reflect Belfast's city status, granted by Queen Victoria in 1888. Its Edwardian design influenced the Victoria Memorial in Calcutta, India, and Durban City Hall in South Africa.[137][138] The dome is 173\u00a0ft (53\u00a0m) high and figures above the door state \"Hibernia encouraging and promoting the Commerce and Arts of the City\".[139] The Royal Courts of Justice and St Anne's Church of Ireland Cathedral are of the same period.  The opening Victoria Square Shopping Centre in 2008 was to symbolize the rebound of the city centre since its days as a restricted security zone during the Troubles.[140] But retail footfall in the centre is limited by competition with out-of-town shopping centres and with internet retailing. As of November 2023, footfall had not recovered pre-COVID pandemic levels.[141] There are compensating trends: the growth in tourism and hospitality which has included a sustained boom in hotel construction.[142]  The City Council also talks of a \u201cresidential-led regeneration\u201d.[143][144] New townhouse and apartments schemes are being developed for the city's quays,[145] and for Titanic Quarter.[146] The completion in 2023 of Ulster University's enhanced Belfast campus (in \"one of the largest higher education capital builds in Europe\")[147] and the determination of Queen's University to compete with the private sector in the provision of student housing,[148] has fostered the construction downtown of multiple new student residences.[149]  People can be found sleeping rough on the streets of the city centre. Numbers, while growing, may be comparatively small for a city of its size in the British Isles. In 2022, counts and estimates by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive identified a total of 26 rough sleepers in Belfast.[150] This is against a background (in 2023) of 2,317 people (0.67% of residents) presenting as homeless, many of whom are in temporary accommodation and shelters.[151] Such figures, however, do not include all those living in severely overcrowded conditions, involuntarily sharing with other households on a long-term basis, or sleeping rough in hidden locations.[152][153]  Since 2001, buoyed by increasing numbers of tourists, the city council has promoted a number of cultural quarters.  The Cathedral Quarter comprises much of Belfast's old trade and warehousing district in the narrow streets and entries around St Anne's Cathedral, with a concentration of  bars, beer gardens, clubs and restaurants (including two establishments claiming descent from the early town, White's and The Duke of York)[154] and performance spaces (most notably the Black Box and Oh Yeah).[155][156] It hosts a yearly visual and performing arts festival. The adjoining Custom House Square is one of the city's main outdoor venues for free concerts and street entertainment.  Without defined geographical boundaries, the Gaeltacht Quarter encompasses Irish-speaking Belfast. (According to the 2021 census, 15.5% of people in the city have some knowledge of Irish, 4% speak it daily).[157] It is generally understood as an area around the Falls Road in west Belfast served by the Cult\u00farlann McAdam \u00d3 Fiaich cultural centre.[158][159] It can be said to include, at the Skainos Centre in unionist east Belfast, Turas, a project that promotes Irish through night classes and cultural events in the belief that \"the language belongs to all\".[160]  The Linen Quarter', an area south of City Hall once dominated by linen warehouses, now includes, in addition to caf\u00e9s, bars and restaurants, a dozen hotels (including the 23-storey Grand Central Hotel), and the city's two principal Victorian-era cultural venues, the Grand Opera House and the Ulster Hall.[161]  Moving further south along the so-called  \"Golden Mile\" of bars and clubs through Shaftesbury Square, there is the Queen's [University] Quarter. In addition to the university (spread over 250 buildings, of which 120 are listed as being of architectural merit),[162] it is home to Botanic Gardens and the Ulster Museum.[163]  Finally, the Titanic Quarter covers 0.75\u00a0km2 (185 acres) of reclaimed land adjacent to Belfast Harbour, formerly known as Queen's Island. Named after RMS Titanic, launched here in 1911,[164] work began in 2003 to transform some former shipyard land into \"one of the largest waterfront developments in Europe\".[165] The current area houses Titanic Belfast, the Public Records Office of Northern Ireland (PRONI), two hotels, and multiple condo towers and shops, and the Titanic [film] Studios.[166]  From Georgian Belfast, the city retains a civic legacy. In addition to Clifton House[169] (Belfast Charitable Society, 1774), this includes the Linen Hall Library[170] (Belfast Society for Promoting Knowledge, 1788), the Ulster Museum (founded by the Belfast Natural History Society as the Belfast Municipal Museum and Art Gallery in 1833), and the Botanic Gardens[171] (established in 1828 by the Belfast Botanic and Horticultural Society).[171] These remain important cultural venues: in the case of the Gardens, for outdoor festivities including the Belfast Mel\u0101, the city's annual celebration of global cultures.[172]  Of the many stage venues built in the nineteenth century, and film theatres built in the twentieth, there remains the Ulster Hall (1862),[173] which hosts concerts (including those of the Ulster Orchestra), classical recitals and party-political meetings; the Grand Opera House[174] (1895) badly damaged in bomb blasts in the early 1990s, restored and enlarged 2020; the Strand Cinema[175] (1935) now being developed as an arts centre;[176] and the Queens Film Theatre (QFT) (1968) focussed on art house and world cinema.[177] The two independent cinemas offer their screens for the Belfast Film Festival and the Belfast International Arts Festival.  The principal stage for drama remains the Lyric Theatre (1951), the largest employer of actors and other theatre professionals in the region.[178] At Queens University, drama students stage their productions at the Brian Friel Theatre, a 120-seat studio space (named after the renowned playwright).[179]  In November 2011, Belfast became the smallest city to host the MTV Europe Music Awards.[180] The event was made possible by the 11,000-seat Odyssey Arena (today the SSE Arena) which opened in 2000 at the entrance to the Titanic Quarter[181] A further large-scale venue is the Waterfront Hall, a multi-purpose conference and entertainment centre that first opened in 1997. The main circular Auditorium seats 2,241 and is based on the Berlin Philharmonic Hall.[182] In 2012, the Metropolitan Arts Centre, usually referred to as the MAC, was opened in the Cathedral Quarter, offering a performance mix of music, theatre, dance and visual art.[183]  The city has a number of community arts, and arts education, centres, among them the Crescent Arts Centre[184] in south Belfast, the Irish-language  Cult\u00farlann McAdam \u00d3 Fiaich[185] in west Belfast, The Duncairn[186] in north Belfast and, in the east of the city, EastSide Arts.[187]  F\u00e9ile an Phobail, a community arts organisation born out of the Internment Commemorations in the west of the city, stages one of the largest community festivals in Europe.[188] It has grown from its original August F\u00e9ile on the Falls Road, to a year-round programme with a broad range of arts events, talks and discussions.[189]  In November 2021, Belfast became the third city in the British Isles to be designated by UNESCO as City of Music (after Glasgow in 2008 and Liverpool in 2016) and is one of 59 cities worldwide participating in the UNESCO Creative Cities Network.[190][191]  The greater part of Belfast's music scene is accommodated in the city's pubs and clubs. Irish traditional music (\"trad\") is a staple, and is supported, along with Ulster-Scots snare drum and pipe music, by the city's TradFest summer school.[192][193]  Music offerings also draw on the legacy of the punk[194] and the underground club scene that developed during The Troubles[195] (associated with the groups Stiff Little Fingers and The Undertones, and celebrated in the award-winning 2013 film, Good Vibrations).[196] Snow Patrol's frontman Gary Lightbody led a line up of private donors that together with public funders established the Oh Yeah music centre in 2008.[197] The Cathedral Quarter non-profit supports young musicians and these have engaged with a range of genres including Alternative rock, Indie rock, Electronica, Post rock, Post punk, Crossover, and Experimental rock.  Queens University hosts the Sonic Arts Research Centre (SARC), an institute for music-based practice and research. Its purpose designed building, Sonic Laboratory and multichannel studios were opened by Karlheinz Stockhausen, the German composer and \"father of electronic music\",[198][199] in 2004.[200]  Belfast is the home of the Belfast Telegraph, Irish News, and The News Letter, the oldest English-language daily newspaper in the world still in publication.[201][202]  The city is the headquarters of BBC Northern Ireland, ITV station UTV and commercial radio stations Q Radio and U105. Two community radio stations, Blast 106 and Irish-language station Raidi\u00f3 F\u00e1ilte, broadcast to the city from west Belfast. Queen's Radio, a student-run radio station broadcasts from Queen's University Students' Union.  One of Northern Ireland's two community TV stations, NvTv, is based in the Cathedral Quarter of the city.. Broadcasting only over the Internet is Homely Planet, the Cultural Radio Station for Northern Ireland, supporting community relations.[203]  Since the lifting in 1872 of a twenty-year party processions ban, Orange parades in celebration of \"the Twelfth\" [of July] and the bonfires of the previous evening, the eleventh, have been a fixed fixture of the Belfast calendar.[204] On what became a public holiday in 1926,[205] Belfast and guest Orange lodges with their pipe, flute and drum bands muster at Carlisle Circus, and parade through the city centre passed the City Hall and out Lisburn Road to a gathering in \"the field\" at Barnett Demesne.[206] While some local feeder and return marches have a history of sectarian disturbance, in recent years, events have generally passed off without serious incident.[207]  In 2015, the Orange Order opened the Museum of Orange Heritage on the Cregagh Road in East Belfast with the aim of educating the wider public about \"the origins, traditions and continued relevance\" of the parading institution.[208]  What it sometimes referred to as the Catholic equivalent the Orangemen,[209] the Ancient Order of Hibernians, confines its parades to home ground in west and north Belfast,[210] as do republicans commemorating the Easter Rising.[211] In August 1993, in a break with a history of nationalist exclusion from the city centre, a parade marking the introduction of internment in the 1971 proceeded up Royal Avenue toward the City Hall, where it was addressed by Sinn F\u00e9in president, Gerry Adams, in front of the statue of Queen Victoria.[212]  Since 1998, the Belfast City Council has funded a city-centre St. Patrick's Day (March 17) celebration. It is organised by F\u00e9ile an Phobail as a \"carnival\" complete with a parade featuring dancers, circus entertainers, floats, and giant puppets.[213] Critical of what they perceive as an evolving nationalist festival, unionists on the City Council observe that \"a lot of the Protestant Unionist Loyalist (PUL) community will stay away from the city centre on St Patrick\u2019s Day, the same as some stay away on the Twelfth of July\".[214]  In 1991, Belfast hosted its first gay pride event. Belfast Pride, culminating in a city-centre parade at the end of July, is now one of the biggest annual festivals in the city and, according to its organisers, the largest LGBT+ festival in Ireland.[215][216]  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions organises an annual city-centre May Day march and rally.[217] The International Workers Day has been a public holiday since 1978.[218]  In 2021, there were 345,418 residents within the expanded 2015 Belfast local government boundary[7] and 634,600 in the Belfast Metropolitan Area,[226] approximately one third of Northern Ireland's 1.9 million population.   As with many cities, Belfast's inner city is currently characterised by the elderly, students and single young people, while families tend to live on the periphery. Socio-economic areas radiate out from the Central Business District, with a pronounced wedge of affluence extending out the Malone Road and Upper Malone Road to the south.[227] Deprivation levels are notable in the inner parts of the north and the west of the city. The areas around the Falls Road, Ardoyne and New Lodge (Catholic nationalist) and the Shankill Road (Protestant loyalist) experience some of the highest levels of social deprivation including higher levels of ill health and poor access to services. These areas remain firmly segregated, with 80 to 90 percent of residents being of the one religious designation.[228][229] Consistent with the trend across all of Northern Ireland, the Protestant population within the city has been in decline, while the non-religious, other religious and Catholic population has risen. The 2021 census recorded the following: 43% of residents as Catholic, 12% as Presbyterian, 8% as Church of Ireland, 3% as Methodist, 6% as belonging to other Christian denominations, 3% to other religions and 24% as having either no religion or no declared religion.[157]  In terms of community background, 47.93% were deemed to belong to, or to have been brought up in, the Catholic faith and 36.45% in a Protestant or other Christian-related denomination.[230] The comparable figures in 2011 were 48.60% Catholic and 42.28% Protestant or other Christian-related denomination.[231]  With respondents free to indicate more than one national identity, in 2021 the largest national identity group was \"Irish only\" with 35% of the population, followed by \"British only\" 27%, \"Northern Irish only\" 17%, \"British and \"Northern Irish only\" 7%, \"Irish and Northern Irish only\" 2%, \"British, Irish and Northern Irish only\" 2%, British and Irish less than 1% and Other identities with 10%.[157]  From the mid to late 19th century, there was a community of central European Jews[232] (among its distinguished members, Hamburg-born Gustav Wilhelm Wolff of Harland & Wolff) and of Italians[233] in Belfast.[234] Today, the largest immigrant groups are Poles, Chinese and Indians.[235][236] The 2011 census figures recorded a total non-white population of 10,219 or 3.3%,[236] while 18,420 or 6.6%[235] of the population were born outside the UK and Ireland.[235] Almost half of those born outside the British Isles lived in south Belfast, where they comprised 9.5% of the population.[235] The majority of the estimated 5,000 Muslims[237] and 200 Hindu families[238] living in Northern Ireland resided in the Greater Belfast area. In the 2021 census the percentage of the city's residents born outside the United Kingdom had risen to 9.8.[87]  Services (including retail, health, professional & scientific) account for three quarters of jobs in Belfast. Only 6% remain in manufacturing. The balance is in distribution and construction.[239] In recent years, unemployment has been comparatively low (under 3% in the summer of 2023) for the UK. On the other hand, Belfast, has a high rate of people economically inactive (close to 30%).[240] It is a group, encompassing homemakers, full-time carers, students and retirees,[241] that in Belfast has been swollen by the exceptionally large proportion of the population (27%) with long-term health problems or disabilities[242] (and who, in Northern Ireland generally, are less likely to be employed than in other UK regions).[243]  Of Belfast's Victorian-era industry, little remains The last working linen factory\u2014Copeland Linens Limited, based in the Shankill area\u2014closed in 2013.[244]  In recent years Harland and Wolff, which at peak production in the Second World War had employed around 35,000 people, has had a workforce of no more than two or three hundred refurbishing oil rigs and fabricating off-shore wind turbines. A \u00a31.6 billion Royal Navy contract has offered the yard a new lease, returning it to shipbuilding in 2025.[35]:\u200a261\u2013262\u200a[245]  In 1936, Short & Harland Ltd, a joint venture of Short Brothers and Harland and Wolff began the manufacture of aircraft in the docks area. In 1989, the British government, which had nationalised the company during the Second World War, sold it to the Canadian aerospace company Bombardier. In 2020, it was sold on to Spirit AeroSystems.[246] Producing aircraft components it remains the largest manufacturing concern in Northern Ireland.[247]  Originating in the Short Brothers' missile division, since 2001 Thales Group[248] owned Thales Air Defence Limited[249] has been producing short range air defence and anti-tank missiles[250] (including the NLAW shoulder-launched system deployed against the Russian invasion by Ukraine).[251]  From the 1990s, Belfast established itself as a significant location for call centres and for other back-office services.[252] Attracting U.S. operators such as Citi, Allstate, Liberty Mutual, Aflac and FD Technologies (Kx Systems),[253] it as since been identified by the UK Treasury as \"key fintech [financial technology] hub\".[254] Fintech's key areas (its \"ABCD\") are artificial intelligence, blockchain, cloud computing, and big data.[255]  The sector's principal constraint, cyber security, has been addressed since 2004 by the Queens University Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology (IECIT), and its Centre for Secure Information Technologies (CSIT).[256] The IECIT is the anchor tenant at Catalyst (science park)[257] in the Titanic Quarter, which hosts a cluster of companies seeking to offer innovative cyber-security solutions.[258]  Between 2018 and 2023, film and television production based largely in Belfast, and occupying significant new studio capacity in the ports area, contributed \u00a3330m to Northern Ireland's economy.[259] There are two 8-acre media complexes (serviced by the adjacent City Airport): the Titanic Studios on Queen's Island (the Titanic Quarter) and across the Victoria Channel in Giant's Park on the Lough's north foreshore, the Belfast Harbour Studios.[260]  Together they offer 226,000\u00a0ft\u00b2 of studio space, plus offices and workshops,[261] and have attracted U.S. production companies such as  Amazon, HBO (including all eight series of its fantasy drama Game of Thrones), Paramount, Playtone, Universal, and Warner Bros.[262][260]  At the beginning of 2024, Ulster University, in partnership with Belfast Harbour and supported by Northern Ireland Screen, announced an \u00a372m investment to add to the complex a new virtual production, research and development, facility, Studio Ulster.[263][264] Additional studio space is available at Loop Studios (formerly Britvic) on the Castlereagh Road in East Belfast.[261][265]  Northern Ireland's peace dividend since the 1990s, which includes a marked increase in inward investment,[266][267] has contributed to a large-scale redevelopment of the city centre. Significant projects included Victoria Square, the Cathedral Quarter, Laganside with the Odyssey complex and the landmark Waterfront Hall, the new Titanic Quarter with its Titanic Belfast visitor attraction, and the development of the original Short's harbour airfield as George Best Belfast City Airport.   These developments reflect a boom in tourism (32 million visitors between 2011 and 2018),[35]:\u200a179\u200a and related hotel construction. This has included an entirely new phenomenon for Belfast: in 1999, the port received its first cruise ship.[268] In 2023, Belfast welcomed 153 calls, 8% up from the pre-pandemic record set in 2019. Ship from 32 different countries landed 320,000 passengers.[269]  Belfast has also seen growth of \"conflict tourism\".[35]:\u200a186\u2013191\u200a To the dismay of some, \"tourists take photos of the division lines that are not consigned to history, but are a part of living Belfast: children play football against the walls that tourists flock to. The places and the people themselves have become a spectacle, an attraction.\"[270] Tourist bosses and guides, however, are satisfied that the greater draw is city's other \"must-see attractions\",[271] and its \"convivial food and nightlife scene\".[272]  Invest NI, Northern Ireland's economic development agency is pitching Belfast and its hinterland to foreign investors as \"only region in the world able to trade goods freely with both GB and EU markets\".[273] This follows the 2020 Northern Ireland Protocol and the 2023 Windsor Framework, agreements between the British government and European Union, whereby, post-Brexit, Northern Ireland would effectively remain within the European Single Market for goods while, in principle, retaining unfettered access to the British domestic market. Despite the DUP's derailment of devolved government in protest, local business leaders largely welcomed the new trade regime, hailing the promise of dual EU-GB access as a critical opportunity.[274][275]  In February 2024, the DUP consented to a return of the devolved Assembly and Executive on the understanding that neither the EU nor the British government would defend the integrity of their respective internal markets by conducting routine checks on the bulk of goods passing through Belfast, or other Northern Ireland, ports.[276]  Children from Catholic and Protestant homes in Belfast are taught, for the most part, separately on a pattern that, by the mid-nineteenth century, had been established throughout Ireland.[277] Primary and secondary education is divided between (Catholic) Maintained Schools and (non-Catholic\/ \"Protestant\") Controlled Schools.[278] They are bound by the same curriculum, but their teaching staff are trained separately (in the university colleges of St Mary's and Stranmillis).[279][280]:\u200a200\u2013202\u200a  Since the 1980s, two smaller school sectors have emerged: grant-maintained Integrated schools, which by design bring together children and staff  from both communities, and Irish language medium schools[278]  The Belfast [later Royal Belfast] Academical Institution, opened its doors in 1810 with the intention, in the words of its founder, former United Irishman, William Drennan of being \"perfectly unbiased by religious distinctions\".[281] The principle was not embraced by the town's middle-classes: in practice \"Inst\" provided a grammar education to the town's Presbyterian families while Anglicans favoured the older Royal Belfast Academy (1785); Catholics, St Malachy's diocesan college (1833) and Wesleyans, Methodist College Belfast (1865).  Denominational lines have since blurred, with Catholics in particular moving into the controlled grammars.[282] But the presence of 18 selective grammar schools in Belfast is a further feature of post-primary education in Belfast that distinguishes it from that of comparable cities in Great Britain where  academic selection was abandoned in the 1960s and 70s.[283] Partly prompted by the COVID disruption of external testing in 2021\/22,[284] some the city's grammars have begun to review and amend the practice. It is not clear that this will be on terms that reduce the degree of social segregation they have represented within the system.[285]  In 2006, the Belfast Education and Library Board became part of the consolidated Education Authority for Northern Ireland. In Belfast, the Authority has responsibility for 156 primary,[286] and 48 secondary schools (including the 18 grammars).[287] The system is marked by stark inequalities in outcome.[288] Around 30% of school leavers in the city do not attain 5 GCSEs, A* - C (including Maths and English). For those in receipt of free school meals, the figure rises to over 50%.[289]  Belfast has two universities. Queen's University Belfast was founded as a college in 1845. In 1908, the Catholic bishops lifted their ban on attendance and Queen's was granted university status.[280]:\u200a164,\u200a166\u200a It is a member of the Russell Group, an association of 24 leading research-intensive universities in the UK,[290] and is one of the largest universities in the UK with over 25,000 students \u2013 among them over 4,000 international students.[291]  Ulster University, created in its current form in 1984, is a multi-centre university with a campus on the edge of the Cathedral Quarter of Belfast. Since 2021, this original \"Arts College\" campus has undergone a \u00a31.4bn expansion to accommodate offerings across all departments. The project promises to bring 15,500 staff and students into the city, and to generate 5,000 new jobs.[292][293]  Belfast Metropolitan College (\"Belfast Met\") is a further education college with three main campuses around the city, including several smaller buildings. Formerly known as Belfast Institute of Further and Higher Education, it specialises in vocational education. The college has over 53,000 students enrolled on full-time and part-time courses, making it one of the largest further education colleges in the UK and the largest in the island of Ireland.[294]  Belfast was granted borough status by James VI and I in 1613 and official city status by Queen Victoria in 1888.[295] Since 1973 it has been a local government district under local administration by Belfast City Council.[296]  Belfast has been represented in the British House of Commons since 1801, and in Northern Ireland Assembly, as presently constituted, since 1998.  Belfast City Council is responsible for a range of powers and services, including land-use and community planning, parks and recreation, building control,  arts and cultural heritage.[297] The city's principal offices are those of the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Deputy Lord Mayor and High Sheriff. Like other elected positions within the Council such as Committee chairs, these are filled since 1998 using the D'Hondt system so that in recent years the position has rotated between councillors from the three largest factions, Sinn F\u00e9in, the DUP and the Alliance Party.  The first Lord Mayor of Belfast in 1892, Daniel Dixon, like every mayor but one until 1997 (Alliance in 1979), was a unionist.[298] The first nationalist Lord Mayor of Belfast was Alban Maginness of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) in 1997. The current Lord Mayor is Ryan Murphy of Sinn F\u00e9in, since 2011 the council's largest party. His duties include presiding over meetings of the council, receiving distinguished visitors to the city, representing and promoting the city on the national and international stage.[298]  In 1997, unionists lost overall control of Belfast City Council for the first time in its history, with the Alliance Party holding the balance of power. In 2023, unionists retained just 17 of 60 seats on the council, leaving nationalists (Sinn F\u00e9in and the SDLP) just 4 seats short of a majority.[299] In addition to the 11 Alliance members there are four other councillors, 3 Green and 1 People Before Profit, who refuse a nationalist\/unionist designation.  As Northern Ireland's capital city, Belfast is host to the Northern Ireland Assembly at Stormont, the site of the devolved legislature for Northern Ireland. Belfast is divided into four Northern Ireland Assembly and UK parliamentary constituencies: Belfast North, Belfast West, Belfast South and Belfast East. All four extend beyond the city boundaries to include parts of Castlereagh, Lisburn and Newtownabbey districts. In United Kingdom elections, each constituency returns one MP, on a \"first past the post\" basis to Westminster. In NI Assembly elections each returns, on the basis of proportional representation, five MLAs to Stormont.  In the Northern Ireland Assembly Elections in 2022, Belfast elected 7 Sinn F\u00e9in, 5 DUP, 5 Alliance Party, 1 SDLP, 1 UUP and 1 PBPA MLAs.[300] In the 2017 UK general election, the DUP won all but the Sinn F\u00e9in stronghold of Belfast West. In the 2019 UK general election, they retained only Belfast East, losing Belfast North to Sinn F\u00e9in and Belfast South to the SDLP.  For the next elections the constituencies are redrawn, with Belfast South extended as Belfast South and Mid Down to include parts of Lagan Valley and Strangford.[301]  The Belfast Health & Social Care Trust is one of five trusts that were created on 1 April 2007 by the Department of Health. Belfast contains most of Northern Ireland's regional specialist centres.[302]  The Royal Hospitals site in west Belfast (junction of Grosvenor and Falls roads) contains two hospitals. The Royal Victoria Hospital (its origins in a number of successive institutions, beginning in 1797 with The Belfast Fever Hospital)[303] provides both local and regional services. Specialist services include cardiac surgery, critical care and the Regional Trauma Centre.[304]  The Children's Hospital (Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children) provides general hospital care for children in Belfast and provides most of the paediatric regional specialities.[305]  The Belfast City Hospital (evolved from a 19th-century workhouse and infirmary)[306] on the Lisburn Road is the regional specialist centre for haematology and is home to a najor cancer centre.[307] The Mary G McGeown Regional Nephrology Unit at the City Hospital is the kidney transplant centre and provides regional renal services for Northern Ireland.[308] Musgrave Park Hospital in south Belfast specialises in orthopaedics, rheumatology, sports medicine and rehabilitation. It is home to Northern Ireland's first Acquired Brain Injury Unit.[309]  The Mater Hospital (founded in 1883 by the Sisters of Mercy)[310] on the Crumlin Road provides a wide range of services, including acute inpatient, emergency and maternity services, to north Belfast and the surrounding areas.[311]  The Ulster Hospital, Upper Newtownards Road, Dundonald, on the eastern edge of the city, first founded as the Ulster Hospital for Women and Sick Children in 1872,[312] is the major acute hospital for the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust. It delivers a full range of outpatient, inpatient and daycare medical and surgical services.[313]  Belfast is a relatively car-dependent city by European standards, with an extensive road network including the 22.5 miles (36\u00a0km) M2 and M22 motorway route.[314]  Black taxis are common in the city, operating on a share basis in some areas.[315] These are outnumbered by private hire taxis. Bus and rail public transport in Northern Ireland is operated by subsidiaries of Translink. Bus services in the city proper and the nearer suburbs are operated by Translink Metro, with services focusing on linking residential districts with the city centre on 12 quality bus corridors running along main radial roads,[316]  More distant suburbs are served by Ulsterbus. Northern Ireland Railways provides suburban services along three lines running through Belfast's northern suburbs to Carrickfergus, Larne and Larne Harbour, eastwards towards Bangor and south-westwards towards Lisburn and Portadown. This service is known as the Belfast Suburban Rail system. Belfast is linked directly to Coleraine, Portrush and Derry. Belfast has a direct rail connection with Dublin called Enterprise operated jointly by NIR and the Irish rail company Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann.  The city has two airports: George Best Belfast City Airport, close to the city centre on the eastern shore of Belfast Lough and Belfast International Airport  30\u201340 minutes to the west to the west on the shore of Lough Neagh. Both operate UK domestic and European flights. The city is also served by Dublin Airport, two hours to the south, with direct inter-continental connections.  In addition to its extensive freight business, the port offers car-ferry sailings, operated by Stena Line, to Cairnryan in Scotland (5 Sailings Daily. 2 hours 22 minutes) and to Liverpool-Birkenhead (14 sailings weekly. 8 hours). The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company provides a seasonal connection to Douglas, Isle of Man.  The Glider bus service is a new form of transport in Belfast. Introduced in 2018, it is a bus rapid transit system linking East Belfast, West Belfast and the Titanic Quarter from the City Centre.[317] Using articulated buses, the \u00a390\u00a0million service saw a 17% increase in its first month in Belfast, with 30,000 more people using the Gliders every week. The service is being recognised as helping to modernise the city's public transport.[318]  National Cycle Route 9 to Newry,[319] which will eventually connect with Dublin,[320] starts in Belfast.  Half of Belfast's water is supplied via the Aquarius pipeline from the Silent Valley Reservoir in County Down, created to collect water from the Mourne Mountains.[321] The other half is now supplied from Lough Neagh via Dunore Water Treatment Works in County Antrim[322] (and which, in recent years, has had to contend with the growth in the Lough of toxic cyanobacteria - or blue-green algae).[323] The citizens of Belfast pay for their water in their rates bill. Plans to bring in additional water tariffs were deferred by devolution in May 2007.[324]  Power is provided from a number of power stations via NIE Networks Limited transmission lines. (Just under a half of electricity consumption in Northern Ireland is generated from renewable sources).[325] Phoenix Natural Gas Ltd. started supplying customers in Larne and Greater Belfast with natural gas in 1996 via the newly constructed Scotland-Northern Ireland pipeline.[322] Rates in Belfast (and the rest of Northern Ireland) were reformed in April 2007. The discrete capital value system means rates bills are determined by the capital value of each domestic property as assessed by the Valuation and Lands Agency.[326]  Belfast City Council owns and maintains 17 leisure centres across the city, run on its behalf by the non-profit social enterprise GLL under the \u2018Better\u2019 brand.[327] These include eight large multipurposed centres complete with swimming pools: Ballysillan Leisure Centre and Grove Wellbeing Centre in North Belfast; the Andersonstown, Falls, Shankill and Whiterock leisure centres in West Belfast; Templemore Baths and Lisnasharragh Leisure Centre in East Belfast, and close to the city centre in South Belfast, the Olympia Leisure Centre and Spa,[328]  Belfast has over forty parks. The oldest (1828) and one of the most popular parks Botanic Gardens[329] in the Queen's Quarter. Built in the 1830s and designed by Sir Charles Lanyon, its Palm House is one of the earliest examples of a curvilinear and cast iron glasshouse.[330] Other attractions in the park include the recently restored Tropical Ravine, a humid jungle glen built in 1889,[331] rose gardens and public events ranging from live opera broadcasts to pop concerts.[332]  The largest municipal park in the city, and closest to the city centre, lies on the right bank of Lagan. The 100-acres of Ormeau Park were opened to the public in 1871 on what was the last demesne of the town's former proprietors, the Chichesters, Marquesses of Donegall.[333]  In north Belfast, the Waterworks, two reservoirs to which the public have had access since 1897, are features of a park supporting angling and waterfowl.[334] In 1906, a further water park, Victoria,  opened behind industrial dockland on what had been the eastern shore of the Lough.[335] It is now connected through east Belfast by the Connswater Community Greenway which offers 16\u00a0km of continuous cycle and walkway through east Belfast.[336]  The largest green conservation area within the city's boundaries is a 2,116 hectares patchwork of \"parks, demesnes, woodland and meadows\" stretching upriver along the banks of the Lagan river and canal;[120]  Established in 1967, the Lagan Valley Regional Park envelopes in its course, Belvoir Park Forest, which contains ancient oaks and a 12th-century Norman Motte,[337] and  Sir Thomas and Lady Dixon Park, whose International Rose Garden attracts thousands of visitors each July.[338]  Colin Glenn Forest Park,[339] the National Trust Divis and the Black Mountain Ridge Trail,[340] and Cave Hill Country Park.[341] offer panoramic views over Belfast and beyond from the west.[340] Climbing the Castlereagh Hills, the National Trust Lisnabreeny Cregagh Glen does the same from the east.[342]  Below Cave Hill, the council maintains one of the few local government-funded zoos in the British Isles. The Belfast Zoo houses more than 1,200 animals of 140 species including Asian elephants, Barbary lions, Malayan sun bears (one of the few in the United Kingdom), two species of penguin, a family of western lowland gorillas, a troop of common chimpanzees, a pair of red pandas, a pair of Goodfellow's tree-kangaroos and Francois' langurs. It carries out important conservation work and takes part in European and international breeding programmes which help to ensure the survival of many species under threat.[343]  Belfast has several notable sports teams playing a diverse variety of sports such as football, Gaelic games, rugby, cricket, and ice hockey. The Belfast Marathon is run annually on May Day, The 41st Marathon in 2023, with related events (Wheelchair Race, Team Relay and 8 Mile Walk) attracted 15,000 participants.[344]  The Northern Ireland national football team plays its home matches at Windsor Park. Football clubs with stadia and training grounds in the city include: Linfield, Glentoran, Crusaders, Cliftonville, Donegal Celtic, Harland & Wolff Welders, Dundela, Knockbreda, PSNI, Newington, Sport & Leisure and Brantwood.[345]  Belfast is home to over twenty Gaelic football and hurling clubs.[346] Casement Park in west Belfast, home to the Antrim county teams, had a capacity of 31,500 making it the second largest Gaelic Athletic Association ground in Ulster.[347]  Listed as one of the venues for the UK and Ireland's successful UEFA Euro 2028 bid, with co-funding from the Irish government there are plans for a complete rebuild.[348] In May 2020, the foundation of East Belfast GAA returned Gaelic Games to East Belfast after decades of its absence in the area. The current club president is Irish-language enthusiast Linda Ervine who comes from a unionist background in the area. The team currently plays in the Down Senior County League.[349]  The 1999 Heineken Cup champions Ulster Rugby play at Ravenhill Stadium in the south of the city. Belfast has four teams in rugby's All-Ireland League: Belfast Harlequins in Division 1B; and Instonians, Queen's University and Malone in Division 2A.  Belfast is home to the Stormont cricket ground since 1949 and was the venue for the Irish cricket team's first ever One Day International against England in 2006.[350]  The 9,500 capacity SSE Arena accommodates the Belfast Giants, one of the biggest ice hockey clubs in the UK. Featuring Canadian, ex-NHL players, the club competes the British Elite Ice Hockey League.  Belfast was the home town of former Manchester United player George Best, the 1968 European Footballer of the Year, who died in November 2005. On the day he was buried in the city, 100,000 people lined the route from his home on the Cregagh Road to Roselawn cemetery.[351] Since his death the City Airport was named after him and a trust has been set up to fund a memorial to him in the city centre.[352] Other sportspeople celebrated in the city include double world snooker champion Alex \"Hurricane\" Higgins[353] and world champion boxers Wayne McCullough, Rinty Monaghan and Carl Frampton.[354]  At 54\u00b035\u203249\u2033N 05\u00b055\u203245\u2033W\ufeff \/ \ufeff54.59694\u00b0N 5.92917\u00b0W\ufeff \/ 54.59694; -5.92917, its northern latitude is characterised by short winter days and long summer evenings. During the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, local sunset is before 16:00 while sunrise is around 08:45. At  the summer solstice in June,  the sun sets after 22:00 and rises before 05:00.[355]  For this northern latitude, thanks to the influence of the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift, Belfast has a comparatively mild climate. In summer the temperatures rarely range above 25\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F) or dip in winter below -5\u00a0\u00b0C (23\u00a0\u00b0F).[356][357] The maritime influence, also ensures that the city gets significant precipitation. On 157 days in an average year, rainfall is greater than 1\u00a0mm. Average annual rainfall is 846 millimetres (33.3\u00a0in),[358] less than areas of northern England or most of Scotland,[359] but higher than Dublin or the south-east coast of Ireland.[360]  With its moderate temperatures and abundant rainfall, Belfast's climate is defined as a temperate oceanic climate (Cfb in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system), a classification it shares with most of northwest Europe.[361]  Belfast City Council takes part in the twinning scheme,[365] and is twinned with the following sister cities:  Those who have received the Freedom of the City[367] "},{"title":"Ball (gridiron football)","content":"In Canada and the United States, a football (also called a pigskin)[1] is a ball, roughly in the form of a prolate spheroid, used in the context of playing gridiron football. Footballs are often made of cowhide leather, as such a material is required in professional and collegiate football. Footballs used in recreation, and in organized youth leagues, may be made of rubber, plastic or composite leather (high school football rule books still allow inexpensive all-rubber footballs, though they are less common than leather).  In the 1860s, manufactured inflatable balls were introduced through the innovations of English shoemaker Richard Lindon. These were much more regular in shape than the handmade balls of earlier times, making kicking and carrying easier. These early footballs were plum-shaped.[2]  Some teams used to have white footballs for purposes of night practice.[3]  The football changed in 1934, with a rule change that tapered the ball at the ends more and reduced the size around the middle. This new, sleeker ball made it much easier to handle, particularly for passers, while at the same time making the drop kick unreliable and obsolete.[4] Hugh \"Shorty\" Ray, at the time a college football official and later the NFL's head of officiating, is generally credited with conceiving the pointed football.[5]  From 1941 through 1969 and since 2006, the official game ball of the National Football League (NFL) has been stamped with the nickname \"The Duke\" in honor of Wellington Mara, the longtime owner of the New York Giants, who was named after the Duke of Wellington by his father, Tim Mara, founder and first owner of the Giants. Wilson Sporting Goods, the manufacturer of the NFL ball since 1941, named the ball after Wellington Mara at the urging of George Halas, the owner and head coach of the Chicago Bears, to reward Tim Mara for arranging the contract that made Wilson the official supplier of footballs to the NFL.[6]  The nickname was originally used until 1970, when Wilson changed the game ball upon the National Football League-American Football League merger. Wellington Mara died in 2005 (at age 89), and Wilson returned \"The Duke\" to the game ball the following year in his honor.[6]  Coach John Heisman (the namesake for today's Heisman Trophy) was a Shakespearean actor in the offseason, and would open each season by saying to his freshmen football players:  What is this? It is a prolate spheroid, an elongated sphere in which the outer leather casing is drawn tightly over a somewhat smaller rubber tubing. Better to have died as a small boy than to fumble this football.[further explanation needed][8] Leather panels are typically tanned to a natural brown color, which is usually required in professional leagues and collegiate play. At least one manufacturer uses leather that has been tanned to provide a \"tacky\" grip in dry or wet conditions.[citation needed] Historically, white footballs have been used in games played at night so that the ball can be seen more easily;[citation needed] however, improved artificial lighting conditions have made this no longer necessary. At most levels of play (but not, notably, the NFL), white stripes are painted on each end of the ball, halfway around the circumference, to improve nighttime visibility and also to differentiate the college football from the pro football.[citation needed] However, the NFL once explored the usage of white-striped footballs \u2013 in Super Bowl VIII.[9]  The leather is usually stamped with a pebble-grain texture to help players grip the ball. Some or all of the panels may be stamped with the manufacturer's name, league or conference logos, signatures, and other markings. Four panels or pieces of leather or plastic are required for each football. After a series of quality control inspections for weight and blemishes, workers begin the actual manufacturing process.  Two of the panels are perforated along adjoining edges, so that they can be laced together. One of these lacing panels receives an additional perforation and reinforcements in its center, to hold the inflation valve. Each panel is attached to an interior lining. The four panels are then stitched together in an \"inside-out\" manner. The edges with the lacing holes, however, are not stitched together. The ball is then turned right side out by pushing the panels through the lacing hole. A polyurethane or rubber lining called a bladder is then inserted through the lacing hole. Polyvinyl chloride or leather laces are inserted through the perforations, to provide a grip for holding, hiking and passing the football. Before play, according to the NFL rules, the ball must be inflated to an air pressure between 12.5 and 13.5 pounds per square inch (86 and 93 kilopascals).[10] The ball weighs 14 to 15 ounces (400 to 430 grams).  In the CFL the stripes traverse the entire circumference of the ball; its ball used slightly different dimensions prior to the 2018 season, when the league adopted the NFL specifications for its ball with the previous striping retained.[11] The UFL used a ball with lime-green stripes. The 2001 XFL used a novel color pattern, a black ball with red curved lines in lieu of stripes, for its footballs; this design was redone in a tan and navy color scheme for the Arena Football League in 2003. The 2020 XFL is standard brown but with X markings in team colors at each point (in 2020); in 2023, the league switched to a ball resembling the NFL ball, but with the team logo imprinted on one panel. Three indoor American football leagues; the Can-Am League, UIFL, and AIF, used a ball with red, white and blue panels. Both the 1980s and 2020s incarnations of the USFL have used the same Wilson football the NFL used at the time, with the only differences being the word markings and signature. The World Football League's football was a distinct orange color, said to be more visible during the night as most of that league's games would be played in the evenings.  Prior to the merger, the American Football League's balls, the J6V (or J6-V \/ \"Cushion Control\") and J5V (or J5-V) by Spalding were 1\u20444\u00a0in (0.64\u00a0cm) narrower and 1\u20444\u00a0in (0.64\u00a0cm) longer than the NFL football.[12] In Super Bowl I, the two teams played with their respective footballs from each league; the Chiefs used the AFL ball, and the Packers played with the NFL ball, \"The Duke\" by Wilson.[13]  In an NFL game, the home team must have 36 balls for an outdoor game or 24 for an indoor game, and they must be available for the referee to test with a pressure gauge two and a half hours before the game to keep players from cheating. Twelve new footballs, sealed in a special box and shipped by the manufacturer, are opened in the officials\u2019 locker room two hours and 15 minutes before the game. These balls are specially marked with the letter \"K\" and are used exclusively for the kicking game. The visiting team may also present 12 balls to the referee for outdoor games for inspection.[14] The NFL introduced kicking balls (K-balls) to prevent teams from doctoring balls after the NFL Competition Committee determined that teams conditioned balls so they would fly higher and travel farther.[15]  Since 1941, Horween Leather Company has been the exclusive supplier of leather for National Football League footballs.[16][17][18]  The arrangement was established by Arnold Horween, who had played and coached in the NFL.[19] Horween Leather Company also supplies leather to Spalding, which, at one time, supplied game balls to the now-defunct Arena Football League.[20] Despite the moniker \"pigskin\" sometimes used to refer to footballs, cow leather is used.[21]  Minnesota Vikings kicker Fred Cox, during his NFL career, is credited with developing an all-polyurethane foam football, which he sold to Nerf.[22] Nerf later added the vortex football, also made of foam, with a smaller body and torpedo tail fins, resembling a Ketchum Grenade. Foam footballs such as Nerf's, especially the vortex football, can be thrown greater distances than a traditional air-filled leather or rubber ball,[23] but in turn, kicking range is greatly reduced, with the vortex football being practically unkickable. "},{"title":"Own goal","content":"  An own goal occurs in sports when a player performs actions that result in the player scoring points for the opposition, such as when a football player puts a ball into their own net.  In some parts of the world, the term has become a metaphor for any action that backfires on the person or group undertaking it, sometimes even carrying a sense of \"poetic justice\".[1] During The Troubles, for instance, it acquired a specific metaphorical meaning in Belfast, referring to an IED (improvised explosive device) that detonated prematurely, killing the person making or handling the bomb with the intent to harm others.[2]  A player trying to throw a game might deliberately attempt an own goal.[3] Such players run the risk of being sanctioned or banned from further play.  In association football, an own goal occurs when a player causes the ball to go into their own team's goal, resulting in a goal being scored for the opposition. Defenders often \"turn behind\" dangerous balls into the penalty area, particularly crosses, by kicking or heading the ball out of play behind their goal-line.  In this way, the defender's aim is to concede a corner rather than giving attacking players scoring opportunities.  Consequently, the defender may misjudge and inadvertently turn the ball into their own goal, particularly if they are under pressure from attacking players who might otherwise score. While the defending player who scored the own goal is personally \"credited\" with the goal as part of the statistical abstract of the game (with the annotation \"(og)\" to indicate its nature), own goals are not added to a player's seasonal or career goalscoring total.  The Laws of the Game currently stipulate that an own goal cannot be scored directly from most methods of restarting the game;[nb 1] instead, a corner kick is awarded to the attacking team. This is also the case for the kick-off,[6] and goal kick,[nb 2][nb 3] dropped-ball (since 2012),[8] throw-in,[9] corner kick,[nb 3][13] and free kick (indirect and direct).[14]  The Laws do not stipulate any rules or procedures for crediting goals to players, and indeed such records are not a compulsory part of the game.[15] In 1997 FIFA issued detailed guidelines for crediting own goals, recognising the increasing commercial importance of statistics such as top scorer awards and fantasy football.[15] The guidelines state that credit for scoring is decided by the referee, or match commissioner if present; and \"[a] defender's intervention must be deliberate in order for an own goal to be registered against him\".[15] Regarding a shot which deflects or ricochets into the goal off a defender, some sources credit the score to the attacker; others count them as own goals; for others it depends on whether the original shot was off target; others are more nuanced.[15] There was controversy in 2013 when the Premier League credited Tim Howard with an own goal when a shot came off the post, hit him in the back, and went in.[16]  Major competitions may have video reviews which can alter the accreditation, such as the Dubious Goals Committee of the FA Premier League. In the 2002 FIFA World Cup, one of Ronaldo's eight goals in winning the Golden Boot was initially credited as an own goal but reassigned on appeal by Brazil.[17] UEFA's review procedure was formalised in 2008.[18] As of 2006[update], the English Football League allowed the club which scored to nominate the scorer, which The Guardian criticized with an example from 2002: \"every single national newspaper, agency and football factbook agreed that Coventry City defender Calum Davenport had scored an own goal against Burnley. The Clarets, however, gave the goal to Gareth Taylor\".[19]  The most own goals by a player is held by Irish footballer Richard Dunne with 10 own goals in his career and the most own goals by a club is held by English team Everton F.C. The most infamous own goal was perhaps that of Andr\u00e9s Escobar of Colombia in the 1994 FIFA World Cup which ended in a 2\u20131 loss against the United States and knocked Colombia out; a week later, Escobar was shot dead in Colombia by a drug gang member whose boss had lost betting on the match.[20]  The fastest own goal in history is believed to have been scored by Torquay United defender Pat Kruse, eight seconds into a match against Cambridge United in January 1977.[21][22]  Another notable own goal was scored in a 1994 Caribbean Cup match between Barbados and Grenada. To advance in the competition Barbados needed to win by a margin of 2 or more goals. Because they were winning by just one goal as the match was nearly over, they deliberately scored an own goal to take the match into extra time to give themselves an opportunity to score a goal in extra time. Due to unusual tournament rules, this would not only win the game but also be worth 2 goals allowing them to advance on goal difference.[23]  The most own goals scored in a match was 149 when SO Emyrne deliberately scored 149 own goals for AS Adema due to a protest to a refereeing decision. The final score ended as 149\u20130; it was the biggest loss in a top division match.  If a goal is scored by a player on the defending team, credit for the goal goes to the last player on the other team to have touched the puck; this is because own goals in hockey are typically cases where the player so credited had the shot deflected, but this convention is used even where this is not the case. Occasionally, it is also credited to the closest player to the goal from the other team if he is determined to have caused the opposing player to shoot it into the wrong net. Assists are not awarded on an own goal because the defending team has possession of the puck between any pass and the goal itself. Occasionally in the National Hockey League, players have directed the puck into their own empty net, either late in the game or because of a delayed penalty call. This was the situation which resulted in Billy Smith of the New York Islanders becoming the first goaltender to receive credit for a goal in the NHL. Indeed, of the 16 goals scored by goaltenders in the NHL, 7 were the result of an own goal. In some parts of Canada, an own goal is referred to as a limoges. The term is believed to have originated in New Brunswick (approximately 1970) and became more common in the greater Toronto region starting in the 1990s. [citation needed]  Treatment of \"own goals\" in field hockey has varied over recent years. In 2013 the International Hockey Federation (FIH) implemented a \"mandatory experiment\" such that a deflection of a shot from outside the shooting circle from a defender would be equivalent to a touch from an attacker, and thus if the shot continued into the goal the score would be counted. This proved unpopular and the change was reversed.[24]  Presently rule 8.1 states that \"A goal is scored when the ball is played within the circle by an attacker and does not travel outside the circle before passing completely over the goal-line and under the crossbar.\" Added clarification: \"The ball may be played by a defender or touch their body before or after being played in the circle by an attacker.\"[25] Thus, an \"own goal\" may occur, but in such situations the goal will likely be credited to the attacker whose initial play into the circle was necessary for the goal to stand.  When accidentally scoring at an opposing team's basket (basketball's equivalent of an \"own goal\"), the goal is credited to an offensive player. One typical own-goal scenario occurs when a player tries to block a goal shot but ends up knocking the ball into the goal.  In NFHS basketball, the two points are merely listed for the scoring team, as a footnote.  In NCAA basketball, the rules state: \"When a player scores a field goal in the opponent\u2019s basket, it shall count two points for the opponent regardless of the location on the playing court from where it was released. Such a field goal shall not be credited to a player in the scorebook but shall be indicated with a footnote.\"  In NBA rules, the goal is credited to the player on the scoring team who is closest to defensive shooter and is mentioned in a footnote.  Under FIBA rules, the player designated captain is credited with the basket.  When a ball carrier is tackled or exits the field of play within the end zone being defended by his team, the result is a safety and the opposing team is awarded two points, and receives the ball after a free kick taken at the twenty-yard line (this does not apply if the ball carrier secures possession of the ball in the end zone as a result of an interception or a kick; in that case, no points are awarded and the play is considered a touchback).  A true \"own goal\", in which the team place kicks or drop kicks the ball through their own goal posts (which has never happened at any level in football history and would require either a very strong headwind or a deliberate act of sabotage), is treated as any other backward kick in most leagues' rule books. Backward kicks are treated as fumbles, and as such, a backward kick through the back of the end zone, including through the goal posts, is scored as a safety. This occurred in a 2012 game between two Texas high schools; a punter kicked against a strong wind that blew the ball backward into the end zone, where the defense took control of it.  On two occasions, players disoriented after recovering a fumble have returned the ball into their own teams's end zone, believing they had scored a touchdown only to see the other team receiving a safety. Roy Riegels took a ball 69 yards (more than half the length of the field) to his own end zone during the 1929 Rose Bowl while playing for the University of California, and in 1964 Minnesota Vikings' defensive lineman Jim Marshall went 66 yards pursued by his own teammates in an attempt to prevent him from scoring two points for the San Francisco 49ers. Both men have been remembered for those blunders despite accomplished careers otherwise.  In the final minutes of a game, a team may take a deliberate safety in order to get the free kick, rather than punting from the end zone, or to otherwise run out the clock. In 2003, the New England Patriots came back to win a game after giving a safety that put them three points behind.[26] Similarly, the Baltimore Ravens took a safety with twelve seconds left in Super Bowl XLVII instead of punting out of the end zone, cutting their lead to three points but winning the game since they were able to burn eight seconds off the clock with the safety play, and the opposing San Francisco 49ers were unable to score on the ensuing free kick.  In Canadian football, if a scrimmage kick (punt or missed field goal attempt) is kicked into the end zone and the opponent does not advance it out, the kicking team is awarded a single, worth one point.  In the 2017 Grey Cup, the Calgary Stampeders deliberately took a safety when their punter Rob Maver, having lost control of a high snap, was faced with loss of down deep in his own territory.  He intentionally kicked the ball backwards through the back of his own end zone for a safety.[27]  Gaelic footballers can play the ball with their hands; therefore, they have a much greater degree of control over the ball and thus, own goals are much rarer than they are in association football. They do occur, and two were scored by Mayo in the drawn 2016 All-Ireland SFC Final.[28]  As an own goal is scored when the ball goes under the crossbar, so an \"own point\" is scored (like any other point) when the ball goes over the crossbar. However, when a shot on goal is deflected over the bar by the defending team, the point is credited to the attacker who shot and not considered an \"own point\". Genuine examples of own points are very rare; one was scored by Stefan Connolly in the Cavan championship in 2015, while Seanie Malone scored an own point in the final of the 2019 Clare Senior Football Championship.[29][30]  Kildare player Niall \u00d3 Muineach\u00e1in scored an own goal against London in the opening minute of the 2022 Christy Ring Cup contest.[31] Lancashire GAA corner back Phil Shine also has the unfortunate title of scoring an own goal in the opening round of the Lory Meagher Championship against Longford in 2023.  As a legitimate defensive play, an Australian rules football defender may concede an \"own score\". Such a score, referred to as a rushed behind and statistically credited to no player (score sheets simply include the tally of rushed behinds), results in the opposition team scoring one point. A defending player may choose to concede a rushed behind when the risk of the opposition scoring a goal (worth six points) is high. It is impossible for a team to concede an own goal worth six points.  The hit wicket method of dismissal in cricket has been compared to the own goal concept, as it involves a batter getting themselves out (eliminated from play) with no involvement from the other team.[32] "},{"title":"Great Britain","content":"  Great Britain (commonly shortened to Britain) is an island in the North Atlantic Ocean off the north-west coast of continental Europe, consisting of England, Scotland and Wales. With an area of 209,331\u00a0km2 (80,823\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), it is the largest of the British Isles, the largest European island and the ninth-largest island in the world.[6][note 1] It is dominated by a maritime climate with narrow temperature differences between seasons. The island of Ireland, with an area 40 per cent that of Great Britain, is to the west\u2014these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands and named substantial rocks, form the British Isles archipelago.[8]  Connected to mainland Europe until 9,000 years ago by a landbridge now known as Doggerland,[9] Great Britain has been inhabited by modern humans for around 30,000 years. In 2011, it had a population of about 61 million, making it the world's third-most-populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan,[10][11] and the most populated island outside of Asia.  The term \"Great Britain\" can also refer to the political territory of England, Scotland and Wales, which includes their offshore islands.[12] This territory and Northern Ireland constitute the United Kingdom.[13] The single Kingdom of Great Britain resulted from the 1707 Acts of Union between the kingdoms of England (which at the time incorporated Wales) and Scotland.  The archipelago has been referred to by a single name for over 2000 years: the term 'British Isles' derives from terms used by classical geographers to describe this island group. By 50 BC, Greek geographers were using equivalents of Prettanik\u0113 as a collective name for the British Isles.[14] However, with the Roman conquest of Britain, the Latin term Britannia was used for the island of Great Britain, and later Roman-occupied Britain south of Caledonia.[15][16][17]  The earliest known name for Great Britain is Albion (Greek: \u1f08\u03bb\u03b2\u03b9\u03ce\u03bd) or insula Albionum, from either the Latin albus meaning \"white\" (possibly referring to the white cliffs of Dover, the first view of Britain from the continent) or the \"island of the Albiones\".[18] The oldest mention of terms related to Great Britain was by Aristotle (384\u2013322 BC), or possibly by Pseudo-Aristotle, in his text On the Universe, Vol. III. To quote his works, \"There are two very large islands in it, called the British Isles, Albion and Ierne\".[19]  The first known written use of the word Britain was an ancient Greek transliteration of the original Proto-Celtic term in a work on the travels and discoveries of Pytheas that has not survived. The earliest existing records of the word are quotations of the periplus by later authors, such as those within Strabo's Geographica, Pliny's Natural History and Diodorus of Sicily's Bibliotheca historica.[20] Pliny the Elder (AD 23\u201379) in his Natural History records of Great Britain: \"Its former name was Albion; but at a later period, all the islands, of which we shall just now briefly make mention, were included under the name of 'Britanni\u00e6.'\"[21]  The name Britain descends from the Latin name for Britain, Britannia or Britt\u0101nia, the land of the Britons.[22] Old French Bretaigne (whence also Modern French Bretagne) and Middle English Bretayne, Breteyne. The French form replaced the Old English Breoton, Breoten, Bryten, Breten (also Breoton-lond, Breten-lond). Britannia was used by the Romans from the 1st century BC for the British Isles taken together. It is derived from the travel writings of Pytheas around 320 BC, which described various islands in the North Atlantic as far north as Thule (probably Norway).  The peoples of these islands of Prettanike were called the \u03a0\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03af, Priteni or Pretani.[18] Priteni is the source of the Welsh language term Prydain, Britain, which has the same source as the Goidelic term Cruithne used to refer to the early Brythonic-speaking inhabitants of Ireland.[23] The latter were later called Picts or Caledonians by the Romans. Greek historians Diodorus of Sicily and Strabo preserved variants of Prettanike from the work of Greek explorer Pytheas of Massalia, who travelled from his home in Hellenistic southern Gaul to Britain in the 4th century BC. The term used by Pytheas may derive from a Celtic word meaning \"the painted ones\" or \"the tattooed folk\" in reference to body decorations.[24] According to Strabo, Pytheas referred to Britain as Bretannik\u0113, which is treated a feminine noun.[25][26][27][28] Marcian of Heraclea, in his Periplus maris exteri, described the island group as \u03b1\u1f31 \u03a0\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03bf\u03b9 (the Prettanic Isles).[29]  The Greco-Egyptian scientist Ptolemy referred to the larger island as great Britain (\u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 \u0392\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 megale Brettania) and to Ireland as little Britain (\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u1f70 \u0392\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 mikra Brettania) in his work Almagest (147\u2013148 AD).[31] In his later work, Geography (c.\u2009150 AD), he gave the islands the names Alwion, Iwernia, and Mona (the Isle of Man),[32] suggesting these may have been the names of the individual islands not known to him at the time of writing Almagest.[33] The name Albion appears to have fallen out of use sometime after the Roman conquest of Britain, after which Britain became the more commonplace name for the island.[18]  After the Anglo-Saxon period, Britain was used as a historical term only. Geoffrey of Monmouth in his pseudohistorical Historia Regum Britanniae (c.\u20091136) refers to the island of Great Britain as Britannia major (\"Greater Britain\"), to distinguish it from Britannia minor (\"Lesser Britain\"), the continental region which approximates to modern Brittany and had been settled in the fifth and sixth centuries by Celtic Briton migrants from Great Britain.[citation needed]  The term Great Britain was first used officially in 1474, in the instrument drawing up the proposal for a marriage between Cecily, daughter of Edward IV of England, and James, son of James III of Scotland, which described it as \"this Nobill Isle, callit Gret Britanee\". The Scottish philosopher and historian, John Major (Mair), published his 'History of Great Britain, both England and Scotland' (Historia majoris Britanniae, tam Angliae quam Scotiae) in 1521. While promoting a possible royal match in 1548, Lord Protector Somerset said that the English and Scots were, \"like as twoo brethren of one Islande of great Britaynes again.\" In 1604, James VI and I styled himself \"King of Great Brittaine, France and Ireland\".[34]  Great Britain refers geographically to the island of Great Britain. Politically, it may refer to the whole of England, Scotland and Wales, including their smaller offshore islands.[35] It is not technically correct to use the term to refer to the whole of the United Kingdom which includes Northern Ireland, though the Oxford English Dictionary states \"...the term is also used loosely to refer to the United Kingdom.\"[36][37]  Similarly, Britain can refer to either all islands in Great Britain, the largest island, or the political grouping of countries.[38] There is no clear distinction, even in government documents: the UK government yearbooks have used both Britain[39] and United Kingdom.[40]  GB and GBR are used instead of UK in some international codes to refer to the United Kingdom, including the Universal Postal Union, international sports teams, NATO, and the International Organization for Standardization country codes ISO 3166-2 and ISO 3166-1 alpha-3, whilst the aircraft registration prefix is G.  On the Internet, .uk is the country code top-level domain for the United Kingdom. A .gb top-level domain was used to a limited extent, but is now deprecated; although existing registrations still exist (mainly by government organizations and email providers), the domain name registrar will not take new registrations.  In the Olympics, Team GB is used by the British Olympic Association to represent the British Olympic team. The Olympic Federation of Ireland represents the whole island of Ireland, and Northern Irish sportspeople may choose to compete for either team,[41] most choosing to represent Ireland.[42]  Politically, Great Britain refers to the whole of England, Scotland and Wales in combination,[43] but not Northern Ireland; it includes islands, such as the Isle of Wight, Anglesey, the Isles of Scilly, the Hebrides and the island groups of Orkney and Shetland, that are part of England, Wales, or Scotland. It does not include the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.[43][44]  The political union that joined the kingdoms of England and Scotland happened in 1707 when the Acts of Union ratified the 1706 Treaty of Union and merged the parliaments of the two nations, forming the Kingdom of Great Britain, which covered the entire island. Before this, a personal union had existed between these two countries since the 1603 Union of the Crowns under James VI of Scotland and I of England.[citation needed]  Great Britain was probably first inhabited by those who crossed on the land bridge from the European mainland. Human footprints have been found from over 800,000 years ago in Norfolk[45] and traces of early humans have been found (at Boxgrove Quarry, Sussex) from some 500,000 years ago[46] and modern humans from about 30,000 years ago. Until about 16,000 years ago, it was connected to Ireland by only an ice bridge, prior to 9,000 years ago it retained a land connection to the continent, with an area of mostly low marshland joining it to what are now Denmark and the Netherlands.[47][48]  In Cheddar Gorge, near Bristol, the remains of animal species native to mainland Europe such as antelopes, brown bears, and wild horses have been found alongside a human skeleton, 'Cheddar Man', dated to about 7150 BC.[49] Great Britain became an island at the end of the last glacial period when sea levels rose due to the combination of melting glaciers and the subsequent isostatic rebound of the crust. Great Britain's Iron Age inhabitants are known as Britons; they spoke Celtic languages.  The Romans conquered most of the island (up to Hadrian's Wall in northern England) and this became the Ancient Roman province of Britannia. In the course of the 500 years after the Roman Empire fell, the Britons of the south and east of the island were assimilated or displaced by invading Germanic tribes (Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, often referred to collectively as Anglo-Saxons). At about the same time, Gaelic tribes from Ireland invaded the north-west, absorbing both the Picts and Britons of northern Britain, eventually forming the Kingdom of Scotland in the 9th century. The south-east of Scotland was colonised by the Angles and formed, until 1018, a part of the Kingdom of Northumbria. Ultimately, the population of south-east Britain came to be referred to as the English people, so-named after the Angles.  Germanic speakers referred to Britons as Welsh. This term came to be applied exclusively to the inhabitants of what is now Wales, but it also survives in names such as Wallace and in the second syllable of Cornwall. Cymry, a name the Britons used to describe themselves, is similarly restricted in modern Welsh to people from Wales, but also survives in English in the place name of Cumbria. The Britons living in the areas now known as Wales, Cumbria and Cornwall were not assimilated by the Germanic tribes, a fact reflected in the survival of Celtic languages in these areas into more recent times.[50] At the time of the Germanic invasion of southern Britain, many Britons emigrated to the area now known as Brittany, where Breton, a Celtic language closely related to Welsh and Cornish and descended from the language of the emigrants, is still spoken. In the 9th century, a series of Danish assaults on northern English kingdoms led to them coming under Danish control (an area known as the Danelaw). In the 10th century, however, all the English kingdoms were unified under one ruler as the kingdom of England when the last constituent kingdom, Northumbria, submitted to Edgar in 959. In 1066, England was conquered by the Normans, who introduced a Norman-speaking administration that was eventually assimilated. Wales came under Anglo-Norman control in 1282, and was officially annexed to England in the 16th century.  On 20 October 1604 King James, who had succeeded separately to the two thrones of England and Scotland, proclaimed himself \"King of Great Brittaine, France, and Ireland\".[51] When James died in 1625 and the Privy Council of England was drafting the proclamation of the new king, Charles I, a Scottish peer, Thomas Erskine, 1st Earl of Kellie, succeeded in insisting that it use the phrase \"King of Great Britain\", which James had preferred, rather than King of Scotland and England (or vice versa).[52] While that title was also used by some of James's successors, England and Scotland each remained legally separate countries, each with its own parliament, until 1707, when each parliament passed an Act of Union to ratify the Treaty of Union that had been agreed the previous year. This created a single kingdom with one parliament with effect from 1 May 1707. The Treaty of Union specified the name of the new all-island state as \"Great Britain\", while describing it as \"One Kingdom\" and \"the United Kingdom\". To most historians, therefore, the all-island state that existed between 1707 and 1800 is either \"Great Britain\" or the \"Kingdom of Great Britain\".  Great Britain lies on the European continental shelf, part of the Eurasian Plate and off the north-west coast of continental Europe, separated from this European mainland by the North Sea and by the English Channel, which narrows to 34\u00a0km (18\u00a0nmi; 21\u00a0mi) at the Straits of Dover.[53] It stretches over about ten degrees of latitude on its longer, north\u2013south axis and covers 209,331\u00a0km2 (80,823\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), excluding the much smaller surrounding islands.[54] The North Channel, Irish Sea, St George's Channel and Celtic Sea separate the island from the island of Ireland to its west.[55] The island is since 1993 joined, via one structure, with continental Europe: the Channel Tunnel, the longest undersea rail tunnel in the world. The island is marked by low, rolling countryside in the east and south, while hills and mountains predominate in the western and northern regions. It is surrounded by over 1,000 smaller islands and islets. The greatest distance between two points is 968.0\u00a0km (601+1\u20442\u00a0mi) (between Land's End, Cornwall and John o' Groats, Caithness), 838 miles (1,349\u00a0km) by road.  The English Channel is thought to have been created between 450,000 and 180,000\u00a0years ago by two catastrophic glacial lake outburst floods caused by the breaching of the Weald-Artois Anticline, a ridge that held back a large proglacial lake, now submerged under the North Sea.[56] Around 10,000\u00a0years ago, during the Devensian glaciation with its lower sea level, Great Britain was not an island, but an upland region of continental north-western Europe, lying partially underneath the Eurasian ice sheet. The sea level was about 120 metres (390\u00a0ft) lower than today, and the bed of the North Sea was dry and acted as a land bridge, now known as Doggerland, to the Continent. It is generally thought that as sea levels gradually rose after the end of the last glacial period of the current ice age, Doggerland reflooded cutting off what was the British peninsula from the European mainland by around 6500\u00a0BC.[57]  Great Britain has been subject to a variety of plate tectonic processes over a very extended period of time. Changing latitude and sea levels have been important factors in the nature of sedimentary sequences, whilst successive continental collisions have affected its geological structure with major faulting and folding being a legacy of each orogeny (mountain-building period), often associated with volcanic activity and the metamorphism of existing rock sequences. As a result of this eventful geological history, the island shows a rich variety of landscapes.  The oldest rocks in Great Britain are the Lewisian gneisses, metamorphic rocks found in the far north west of the island and in the Hebrides (with a few small outcrops elsewhere), which date from at least 2,700\u00a0My ago. South of the gneisses are a complex mixture of rocks forming the North West Highlands and Grampian Highlands in Scotland. These are essentially the remains of folded sedimentary rocks that were deposited between 1,000\u00a0My and 670\u00a0My ago over the gneiss on what was then the floor of the Iapetus Ocean.  In the current era the north of the island is rising as a result of the weight of Devensian ice being lifted. Counterbalanced, the south and east is sinking, generally estimated at 1\u00a0mm (1\u204425\u00a0inch) per year, with the London area sinking at double this partly due to the continuing compaction of the recent clay deposits.  Animal diversity is modest, as a result of factors including the island's small land area, the relatively recent age of the habitats developed since the last glacial period and the island's physical separation from continental Europe, and the effects of seasonal variability.[59] Great Britain also experienced early industrialisation and is subject to continuing urbanisation, which have contributed towards the overall loss of species.[60] A DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) study from 2006 suggested that 100 species have become extinct in the UK during the 20th century, about 100 times the background extinction rate. However, some species, such as the brown rat, red fox, and introduced grey squirrel, are well adapted to urban areas.  Rodents make up 40% of the mammal species.[citation needed] These include squirrels, mice, voles, rats and the recently reintroduced European beaver.[60] There is also an abundance of European rabbit, European hare, shrews, European mole and several species of bat.[60] Carnivorous mammals include the red fox, Eurasian badger, Eurasian otter, weasel, stoat and elusive Scottish wildcat.[61] Various species of seal, whale and dolphin are found on or around British shores and coastlines. The largest land-based wild animals today are deer. The red deer is the largest species, with roe deer and fallow deer also prominent; the latter was introduced by the Normans.[61][62] Sika deer and two more species of smaller deer, muntjac and Chinese water deer, have been introduced, muntjac becoming widespread in England and parts of Wales while Chinese water deer are restricted mainly to East Anglia. Habitat loss has affected many species. Extinct large mammals include the brown bear, grey wolf and wild boar; the latter has had a limited reintroduction in recent times.[60]  There is a wealth of birdlife, with 628 species recorded,[63] of which 258 breed on the island or remain during winter.[64] Because of its mild winters for its latitude, Great Britain hosts important numbers of many wintering species, particularly waders, ducks, geese and swans.[65] Other well known bird species include the golden eagle, grey heron, common kingfisher, common wood pigeon, house sparrow, European robin, grey partridge, and various species of crow, finch, gull, auk, grouse, owl and falcon.[66] There are six species of reptile on the island; three snakes and three lizards including the legless slowworm. One snake, the adder, is venomous but rarely deadly.[67] Amphibians present are frogs, toads and newts.[60] There are also several introduced species of reptile and amphibian.[68]  In a similar sense to fauna, and for similar reasons, the flora consists of fewer species compared to much larger continental Europe.[69] The flora comprises 3,354 vascular plant species, of which 2,297 are native and 1,057 have been introduced.[70] The island has a wide variety of trees, including native species of birch, beech, ash, hawthorn, elm, oak, yew, pine, cherry and apple.[71] Other trees have been naturalised, introduced especially from other parts of Europe (particularly Norway) and North America. Introduced trees include several varieties of pine, chestnut, maple, spruce, sycamore and fir, as well as cherry plum and pear trees.[71] The tallest species are the Douglas firs; two specimens have been recorded measuring 65 metres or 212 feet.[72] The Fortingall Yew in Perthshire is the oldest tree in Europe.[73]  There are at least 1,500 different species of wildflower.[74] Some 107 species are particularly rare or vulnerable and are protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. It is illegal to uproot any wildflowers without the landowner's permission.[74][75] A vote in 2002 nominated various wildflowers to represent specific counties.[76] These include red poppies, bluebells, daisies, daffodils, rosemary, gorse, iris, ivy, mint, orchids, brambles, thistles, buttercups, primrose, thyme, tulips, violets, cowslip, heather and many more.[77][78][79][80] There is also more than 1000 species of bryophyte including algae and mosses across the island. The currently known species include 767 mosses, 298 liverworts and 4 hornworts.[81]  There are many species of fungi including lichen-forming species, and the mycobiota is less poorly known than in many other parts of the world. The most recent checklist of Basidiomycota (bracket fungi, jelly fungi, mushrooms and toadstools, puffballs, rusts and smuts), published in 2005, accepts over 3600 species.[82] The most recent checklist of Ascomycota (cup fungi and their allies, including most lichen-forming fungi), published in 1985, accepts another 5100 species.[83] These two lists did not include conidial fungi (fungi mostly with affinities in the Ascomycota but known only in their asexual state) or any of the other main fungal groups (Chytridiomycota, Glomeromycota and Zygomycota). The number of fungal species known very probably exceeds 10,000. There is widespread agreement among mycologists that many others are yet to be discovered.  London is the capital of England and the United Kingdom as a whole, and is the seat of the United Kingdom's government. Edinburgh is the capital city of Scotland, and is the seat of the Scottish Government as well as the highest courts in Scotland. The Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh is the official residence of the British monarch in Scotland. Cardiff is the capital city of Wales, and is the seat of the Welsh Government.   In the Late Bronze Age, Britain was part of a culture called the Atlantic Bronze Age, held together by maritime trading, which also included Ireland, France, Spain and Portugal. In contrast to the generally accepted view[85] that Celtic originated in the context of the Hallstatt culture, since 2009, John T. Koch and others have proposed that the origins of the Celtic languages are to be sought in Bronze Age Western Europe, especially the Iberian Peninsula.[86][87][88][89] Koch et al.'s proposal has failed to find wide acceptance among experts on the Celtic languages.[85]  All the modern Brythonic languages (Breton, Cornish, Welsh) are generally considered to derive from a common ancestral language termed Brittonic, British, Common Brythonic, Old Brythonic or Proto-Brythonic, which is thought to have developed from Proto-Celtic or early Insular Celtic by the 6th century AD.[90] Brythonic languages were probably spoken before the Roman invasion at least in the majority of Great Britain south of the rivers Forth and Clyde, though the Isle of Man later had a Goidelic language, Manx. Northern Scotland mainly spoke Pritennic, which became Pictish, which may have been a Brythonic language. During the period of the Roman occupation of Southern Britain (AD 43 to c.\u2009410), Common Brythonic borrowed a large stock of Latin words. Approximately 800 of these Latin loan-words have survived in the three modern Brythonic languages. Romano-British is the name for the Latinised form of the language used by Roman authors.  British English is spoken in the present day across the island, and developed from the Old English brought to the island by Anglo-Saxon settlers from the mid 5th century. Some 1.5\u00a0million people speak Scots\u2014which was indigenous language of Scotland and has become closer to English over centuries.[91][92] An estimated 700,000 people speak Welsh,[93] an official language in Wales.[94] In parts of north west Scotland, Scottish Gaelic remains widely spoken. There are various regional dialects of English, and numerous languages spoken by some immigrant populations.  Christianity has been the largest religion by number of adherents since the Early Middle Ages: it was introduced under the ancient Romans, developing as Celtic Christianity. According to tradition, Christianity arrived in the 1st or 2nd century. The most popular form is Anglicanism (known as Episcopalism in Scotland). Dating from the 16th-century Reformation, it regards itself as both Catholic and Reformed. The Head of the Church is the monarch of the United Kingdom, as the Supreme Governor. It has the status of established church in England. There are just over 26\u00a0million adherents to Anglicanism in Britain today,[95] although only around one million regularly attend services. The second largest Christian practice is the Latin Church of the Catholic Church, which traces its history to the 6th century with Augustine of Canterbury and the Gregorian mission. It was the main religion for around a thousand years. There are over 5\u00a0million adherents today, 4.5\u00a0million Catholics in England and Wales[96] and 750,000 in Scotland,[97] although fewer than a million Catholics regularly attend mass.[98]  The Church of Scotland, a form of Protestantism with a Presbyterian system of ecclesiastical polity, is the third most numerous on the island with around 2.1\u00a0million members.[99] Introduced in Scotland by clergyman John Knox, it has the status of national church in Scotland. The monarch of the United Kingdom is represented by a Lord High Commissioner. Methodism is the fourth largest and grew out of Anglicanism through John Wesley.[100] It gained popularity in the old mill towns of Lancashire and Yorkshire, also amongst tin miners in Cornwall.[101] The Presbyterian Church of Wales, which follows Calvinistic Methodism, is the largest denomination in Wales. There are other non-conformist minorities, such as Baptists, Quakers, the United Reformed Church (a union of Congregationalists and English Presbyterians), Unitarians.[102] The first patron saint of Great Britain was Saint Alban.[103] He was the first Christian martyr dating from the Romano-British period, condemned to death for his faith and sacrificed to the pagan gods.[104] In more recent times, some have suggested the adoption of St Aidan as another patron saint of Britain.[105] From Ireland, he worked at Iona amongst the D\u00e1l Riata and then Lindisfarne where he restored Christianity to Northumbria.[105]  The three constituent countries of the United Kingdom have patron saints: Saint George and Saint Andrew are represented in the flags of England and Scotland respectively.[106] These two flags combined to form the basis of the Great Britain royal flag of 1604.[106] Saint David is the patron saint of Wales.[107] There are many other British saints. Some of the best known are Cuthbert, Columba, Patrick, Margaret, Edward the Confessor, Mungo, Thomas More, Petroc, Bede, and Thomas Becket.[107]  Numerous other religions are practised.[108] The 2011 census recorded that Islam had around 2.7\u00a0million adherents (excluding Scotland with about 76,000).[109] More than 1.4\u00a0million people (excluding Scotland's about 38,000) believe in Hinduism, Sikhism, or Buddhism\u2014religions that developed in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.[109] Judaism figured slightly more than Buddhism at the 2011 census, having 263,000 adherents (excluding Scotland's about 6000).[109] Jews have inhabited Britain since 1070. However, those resident and open about their religion were expelled from England in 1290, replicated in some other Catholic countries of the era. Jews were permitted to re-establish settlement as of 1656, in the interregnum which was a peak of anti-Catholicism.[110] Most Jews in Great Britain have ancestors who fled for their lives, particularly from 19th century Lithuania and the territories occupied by Nazi Germany.[111] "},{"title":"Video assistant referee","content":"  The video assistant referee (VAR) is a match official in association football who assists the referee by reviewing decisions using video footage and providing advice to the referee based on those reviews.   The assistant video assistant referee (AVAR) is a match official appointed to assist the VAR in the video operation room and around the pitch. There are 3 AVARs (AVAR1, AVAR2, and AVAR3) that are assigned to different parts of the game that they are charged with reviewing, and are in consistent communication with the VAR about possible situations that might warrant further review. The job of the AVAR1 is to watch the main camera and communicate some of the more obvious offenses within the game. The AVAR2 is located at the offside station and are responsible for assisting the VAR with offsides and reporting possible missed offside calls. The AVAR3 is responsible for monitoring the TV programs and assists in communication between the AVAR2 and the VAR since the AVAR2 is at the offside station. [1]  In addition to the VAR and the AVARs there are 3 replay operators that help the VAR and AVARs select the cameras with the best angle.[1]  Following extensive trialling in a number of major competitions, VAR was formally written into the Laws of the Game by the International Football Association Board (IFAB) on March 3, 2018.[2] Operating under the philosophy of \"minimal interference, maximum benefit\",[3][4] the VAR system seeks to provide a way for \"clear and obvious errors\" and \"serious missed incidents\" to be corrected.  There are four categories of decisions that can be reviewed.[5]  The VAR and the AVARs automatically check every on-field referee decision falling under the four reviewable categories. The VAR may perform a \"silent check,\" communicating to the referee that no mistake was made, while not causing any delay to the game. At other times, a VAR check may cause the game to be delayed while the VAR ascertains whether or not a possible mistake has occurred. The referee may delay the restart of play for this to occur, and indicates an ongoing check by pointing to their ear.  Where the VAR does identify a possible clear and obvious error, there are three possible scenarios:[6]  A decision can generally be overturned without an OFR where it relates to a factual matter. For example, offside decisions or whether a foul occurred inside or outside the penalty area can be determined by the VAR to the referee without a review. VAR will recommend an OFR where there is a subjective decision to make, such as whether a foul was committed in the first place or whether a red card is warranted for a certain offence. In all cases, the final decision rests with the referee, and they can choose to ignore the advice of the VAR altogether.[7]  An OFR can only be conducted on the recommendation of the VAR. This ensures that the referee always makes an on-field ruling and does not rely on OFRs for every close decision. An OFR can be conducted when the ball is out of play, or where the referee stops play for the express purpose of conducting one.[5]  The referee signals an OFR by making the outline of a rectangle, indicating a video screen. The OFR takes place in a designated referee review area (RRA), adjacent to the field of play and in public view to ensure transparency. Slow motion replays are only used to establish point of contact for physical offences and handball, while full-speed replays are shown to determine the intensity of an offence or whether a handball occurred in the first place.[citation needed] During an OFR, the VAR transmits several video replays from different camera angles to assist the referee in making a decision.  Once an OFR is compleCamted, the referee makes the TV signal again, before indicating the decision made. If the ball was out of play, it restarts with either the original decision or the new decision if the on-field one was changed. If play was stopped to conduct an OFR and the decision was not changed, a dropped ball occurs.[8]   A number of offences relating to the VAR process are codified within the Laws of the Game. Both players and team officials can be cautioned for excessively protesting an on-field decision by making the TV signal. Any player or team official entering the RRA are also cautioned. Finally, entering the VOR will cause a player or team official to be sent off.[9] The VAR and the AVARs are often located within the stadium where the match is being played. Certain leagues have begun using a centralized review location. For example, the English Premier League stations all its VAR teams in the video operation room (VOR) at Stockley Park in London and the German Football Association in Cologne-Deutz.[10] During its 2022 season, Major League Soccer in the United States created a Video Review Center in Atlanta where all its VAR teams operate.[11]  The Var system consists of 42 cameras including slow and ultra slow motion cameras as well as the cameras used in offside technology, and all FIFA host broadcaster camera feeds to ensure the VAR has the best angle possible on every play.[1]  A number of technical terms and abbreviations are used in reference to the VAR system. These include:[12]  VAR was conceived by the Refereeing 2.0 project in the early 2010s and under the direction of the Royal Netherlands Football Association (KNVB).[17] The system was tested through mock trials during the 2012\u201313 season of the Eredivisie, the country's top football league. In 2014, the KNVB petitioned the International Football Association Board (IFAB) to amend its laws of the games to allow the system to be used during more extensive trials. The IFAB approved trials and a pathway to full implementation during its 2016 general meeting.[17][18] Lukas Brud, IFAB secretary, said \"With all the 4G and Wi-Fi in stadia today...we knew we had to protect referees from making mistakes that everyone can see immediately\", such as Thierry Henry\u2019s handball that eliminated Ireland from qualifying for the 2010 FIFA World Cup where the on-field referees were not in a position to view the infraction.  Proposals to introduce any form of video review were consistently rejected by FIFA president Sepp Blatter. Throughout his presidency, Blatter was vehemently opposed to the introduction of any new technology to challenge the live decisions of referees in football, often even going to far as to intervene (or threaten to) in domestic competition matters where the only pertinent question was whether suspensions for questionable sendings off should be enforced. After Blatter was forced out of his post due to an unrelated corruption scandal in 2015, the VAR proposal received a warm reception under his successor Gianni Infantino.[17]  The first live trial of the VAR system was in July 2016 in a friendly match between PSV and FC Eindhoven.[19]  The next live trial of the VAR system began in August 2016 with a United Soccer League match between two Major League Soccer reserve sides.[20] Match referee Ismail Elfath reviewed two fouls during the match and, after consultation with video assistant referee Allen Chapman, decided to issue a red card and a yellow card in the respective incidents.[21]  Video reviews were introduced the following month during an international friendly between France and Italy.[22]  The first professional \"non-friendly\" game was an official first round KNVB Cup tie between Ajax and Willem II on 21 September 2016.[23] This match was the first match to include a \"pitchside monitor\". The pitchside monitor would allow the referee to review footage from the field. Based on VAR but not using the available pitchside monitor, a yellow card was turned into a red card and thus this was the first ever VAR based expulsion in a professional game.[24] Interestingly, this professional and official Cup game was played before the official FIFA rule changes. Although viewers watching the match on television were made aware of the decision, the public in the stadium and, to a lesser extent, the players were confused as to what had happened. The major lesson from the confusion around this first major decision change was that VAR decisions needed to be clearly communicated to the players, the watching public inside the stadium, and on TV.[24]  The next event that VAR was used, including a \"pitchside monitor\" was at the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup.[25] Kashima Antlers were awarded a penalty after a video review in the 3\u20130 win of semi-final against Atl\u00e9tico Nacional.  The A-League in Australia became the first to use a VAR system in a top-flight professional club competition on 7 April 2017, when Melbourne City played Adelaide United[26] though this game was completed without the VAR being called upon.[27] The first intervention by a VAR in a professional national league game was seen on 8 April when Wellington Phoenix hosted Sydney FC. The VAR identified an illegal handball in the penalty area and awarded Sydney FC a penalty. The game finished in a 1\u20131 draw.[28][29]  Major League Soccer in the United States introduced VAR in competitive matches during its 2017 season after the 2017 MLS All-Star Game on 2 August 2017.[30][31] Its first official use came during a match between the Philadelphia Union and FC Dallas, invalidating a goal from the latter over contact made between a Dallas player and Philadelphia's goalkeeper.[32] VAR was used at an international level in the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup in June, where it was praised, but its usefulness was questioned after a referee decision in the final match.[33][34]  Also in 2017, Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) had its first official match using VAR, during Portuguese Cup Final between SL Benfica and Vitoria SC at Jamor Stadium on the 28 May 2017. Portuguese Football Federation was the first country in the world to use VAR in a Women's competition: one week after men's Cup final, in the same stadium, VAR was officially used in a Women's match between Sporting CP and SC Braga.  After the 2016 introduction in CUP football in Europe, the VAR system was introduced in top-flight European football league competitions by Bundesliga and the Serie A at the beginning of the 2017\u201318 season[35] and by La Liga at the beginning of the 2018\u201319 season.[36] The system was also used at the 2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup in October.[37] On 8 January 2018, VAR was trialled for the first time in England in the 2017\u201318 FA Cup game between Brighton & Hove Albion and Crystal Palace,[38] and the following day it was trialled for the first time in France in the C\u00f4te d'Azur derby game in the 2017\u201318 French League Cup. It was said to have worked well.[39]  Italy opened the world's first VAR training centre in Coverciano in January 2018.[40]  The Var system that is currently used was created by Hawk-Eye Innovations Limited and was tested according to FIFA\u2019s Quality Programme by a third party[1] On 3 March 2018, the IFAB wrote VAR into the Laws of the Game on an incorrect basis.[41] Its use remains optional for competitions, and the English Premier League and the UEFA Champions League were not expected to implement VAR for their 2018\u201319 season.[42] However Premier League executive chairman Richard Scudamore described it as \"inevitable\" that VAR will be introduced to the Premier League.[43] On 27 September 2018, UEFA announced that from the 2019\u201320 UEFA Champions League season, VAR will be used in the competition.[44] Although VAR was not implemented in the group stages of the 2018\u201319 season, UEFA announced on 3 December 2018, that VAR would be used in the knockout stages, which commenced in February 2019.[45]  On 15 November 2018, Premier League teams voted in principle to bring Video Assistant Referees to the Premier League from the 2019\u201320 season onwards pending approval of IFAB and FIFA; this came after a controversial decision from referee Simon Hooper to disallow a goal scored by Southampton F.C. striker Charlie Austin.[46]  On 1 January 2020, the Emperor's Cup Final was the first Japanese football match to use VAR. This was also a preparation for the introduction of VAR into Olympic football.  FIFA officially approved the use of VAR for the 2018 FIFA World Cup during the FIFA Council meeting on 16 March 2018 in Bogot\u00e1.[47][42][48][49] This tournament became the first competition to use VAR in full (at all matches and in all venues).[50]  The 2018 World Cup marked the system's World Cup debut. A total of 335 incidents were checked by the VAR over the course of the group stage, averaging seven per match, and fourteen calls made by referees were changed or overruled after being reviewed by the VAR. According to FIFA, the VAR system had a success rate of 99.3 percent, up from the 95 percent of correct calls by referees without VAR.[51] The first VAR decision at the World Cup came on 16 June 2018 in a group stage match between France and Australia, where referee Andres Cunha awarded a penalty to France after consulting with the VAR.[52][53] In the final, referee N\u00e9stor Pitana used the VAR to review a defensive foul for handling in the penalty area, awarding France a penalty, which gave them a 2\u20131 lead over Croatia. The final eventually ended with France prevailing 4\u20132.[54]  The use of VAR has been credited with assisting the 2018 edition's status as the cleanest World Cup since 1986, after no red cards were issued in the opening 11 games and only four players were sent off in the entire tournament which was the fewest since 1978.[55] 22 goals were scored from 29 awarded penalty kicks, beating the previous record of 17 penalty kick goals set in the 1998 tournament; the dramatic increase in the number of penalties awarded at the 2018 World Cup has been attributed to VAR catching fouls which would otherwise have remained unpunished.[56] IFAB technical director and former Premier League referee David Elleray stated a belief that the presence of VAR meant that players would know that they would not be able to get away with anything under the new system.[57]  The use of video technology at the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup was criticised after several contentious moments involving VAR at the tournament. It was accused of \"creating as much confusion as clarity\".[58][59]  Further criticism was leveled at VAR after it suffered issues preventing its use, for example in a Portuguese match where a supporter's flag had been obscuring the VAR camera,[60][61] or in the 2018 A-League Grand Final between Newcastle Jets and Melbourne Victory where the VAR software suffered a technical malfunction which prevented the assistant referee from viewing the replay, allowing Melbourne Victory to wrongly score the only goal of the game and win the A-League Championship with it.[62][63]  After the introduction of VAR in the 2018 World Cup, FIFA deemed it a success. Nevertheless, the use (or lack of use) of VAR has been criticised.[64][65] Independent assessments note that while most decisions were made correctly as a result of VAR, some were wrong despite VAR review and some decisions which were called incorrectly were not even reviewed.[66][64] There have even been incidents when there has been miscommunication between VAR and the referee, such as Liverpool FC v Tottenham FC in September 2023 which ended up being a crucial mistake after VAR told the ref the wrong decision after they thought the on-field decision was the other way about.[67]The Guardian concludes that VAR has been most effective for factual decisions such as offsides and mistaken identities, while subjective decisions such as penalties or the disciplining of players have fared much worse. Lack of clarity and consistency are two main areas of weakness.[68] In addition, research from the University of Bath found that, on average, \"participants thought the ball was kicked 132 miliseconds later than it actually was\",[69] proving that the technology at present has issues with accuracy.  Another line of criticism has been targeted at the effectiveness of the system in achieving its goal. In the opinion of Scott Stinson from the National Post, VAR, like any other replay system, fails to correct human error and instead only adds to the controversies because human judgment is still necessary.[70] Human error has significant social impacts as well, as a research study done in Italy found that players with darker skin complexion were \"more likely to receive punishment for foulls\" with all else held constant.[71] Such a bias, which might be considered an unconscious bias, is likely to only be heightened by VAR.[citation needed]  Lack of transparency is another contentious point, as teams have no way to know which incidents were reviewed by the VAR team.[72] At a press conference held after the group stage, FIFA referees committee chairman Pierluigi Collina showed footage of the decision-making process accompanied with audio of the conversations between VAR officials and the referees. Asked if this audio could be made publicly available, as it is in rugby and cricket, Collina answered affirmatively but cautioned that it might still be too early.[73][74] That said, in an attempt to provide more transparency to fans, sports broadcaster Sky Sports launched the controversial television programme \"Match Officials Mic'd Up\". Produced by the Premier League, the show aims to bring transparency and constructive discourse to the VAR process, with host Michael Owen and PGMOL Chief Howard Webb analysing VAR calls from previous game weeks.[75]  Others have pointed to the game-changing nature of VAR. There is an increase in the number and duration of pause in the game with VAR system.[76] Initial fears that using the system would lengthen the game considerably have not been confirmed, with every VAR review taking up an average of only 80 seconds.[77] The dramatic increase in the number of penalties awarded at the 2018 World Cup has been attributed to VAR catching fouls which would otherwise have remained unpunished. Of the 169 goals scored in the tournament, 22 were from penalty kicks (with 29 being awarded in total), beating the previous record of 17 set in the 1998 FIFA World Cup.[56] Jonathan Liew of The Independent compares the situation to the introduction of the Decision Review System in cricket and notes the changes it had on that sport, and suggests that it might lead to changes of a similar nature in football.[78]  VAR hasn't just affected the teams that are playing the game. English Premier league fans said that VAR has made the game less enjoyable since the introduction of it and will attend fewer games because of this.[79] The increase in pauses during a game has also been a huge factor with the football fans, with a great number of fans saying that they would most likely support VAR if there was a time limit for the amount of time VAR takes when in use.[80]  Use of VAR has actually been shown to increase playing time in both the first and second half, while not significantly altering the amount of other variable, such as penalties, offsides, fouls, and goals except for a considerable decrease in the number of offsides in Mens football matches,[81] which could be contributed to video analysis being more reliable than human judgement in these scenarios.  In February 2019, UEFA issued guidance which stated that players who made a \"TV-screen\" hand gesture should result in a yellow card.[82] \"Excessively using the 'review' (TV screen) signal\" is now listed as a caution for which a player may receive a yellow card in the Laws of the Game.[83] Early uses of VAR in the Premier League, at the beginning of the 2019\u201320 season, were described as confusing to both coaches and fans with the decision making often inconsistent.[84] By 2022 the application of VAR in the Premier League was still subject to criticism. On 3 September 2022, games involving Chelsea, West Ham United, Newcastle United, Crystal Palace, Brentford and Leeds United all contained contentious VAR decisions.[85]  Premier League officials were criticized for taking lucrative jobs in the Middle East. In the match between Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool on 30 September 2023, the VAR Darren England made a decision that led to the disallowance of a valid goal scored by Luis Diaz. England was alleged of losing focus because he had taken an eight-hour flight back from the United Arab Emirates along with Dan Cook, the assistant VAR. The situation further complicated when it was revealed that England and Cook had been in the UAE to supervise a Pro League game. They reportedly received a payment of \u00a315-20k for this duty.[86]  In VAR matches the assistant referees who decide on offsides are required to avoid raising the flag for an offside decision until the play proceeds to a natural conclusion, unless the offside is extremely obvious. This allows a team who might have been called for an offside offence to instead continue and score a goal to be checked by VAR. When play continues there is the chance of an injury occurring that might not before the introduction of VAR. Team-mates Rui Patricio and Conor Coady collided with each other in a game against Liverpool after a delayed offside call allowed play to continue and Fernando Muslera suffered a double leg break after a collision with opposition striker Milan \u0160koda following a delayed offside call in December 2021.[87] It has also been speculated that VAR being available to check on any offside play can subconsciously impact on the decision of an assistant referee, causing them to allow play to continue if an offside play does not result in a goal. Such an action could see a defensive team who defends such an offside play subsequently lose possession of the ball, score an own goal, give away a foul or a corner kick and give their opposition a chance they would not have had if the offside had been called.  Competitions which include VAR confirmed matches are \"live\" matches, i.e. where the VARs have contact with the referee on the field of play and therefore may have an impact on the decision making.[88]  There is also an idea of implementing VAR in futsal matches.[89] "},{"title":"Football player","content":"  A football player or footballer is a sportsperson who plays one of the different types of football. The main types of football are association football, American football, Canadian football, Australian rules football, Gaelic football, rugby league, and rugby union.  It has been estimated that there are 250 million association football players in the world,[1] and many play other forms of football.  Jean-Pierre Papin has described football as a \"universal language\".[2] Footballers across the world and at almost any level may regularly attract large crowds of spectators, and players are the focal points of widespread social phenomena such as association football culture.  Footballers generally begin as amateurs and the best players progress to become professional players. Normally they start at a youth team (any local team) and from there, based on skill and talent, scouts offer contracts. Once signed, some learn to play better football and a few advance to the senior or professional teams.  Pay in some top men's leagues is significantly higher than in other jobs. Players in the Premier League earn an average of $3 million per year.[3] In the wealthiest clubs in European football leagues, men earn an average $7.19 million per year.[4] The best players of those clubs can earn up to $260 million per year.[5]  However, only a fraction of men's professional football players are paid at this level. Wages may be somewhat more moderate in other divisions and leagues. For example, the average annual salary for footballers in Major League Soccer (MLS) is $530,262 as of May 2023.[6]  Average salaries in women's leagues are far lower. For example, players in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), which started in 2012, earn an average of $54,000 per year as of May 2022.[7] For the first time in 2022, the NWSL guaranteed players a living wage. The minimum salary in 2023 is $36,400 to ensure players do not need second or third jobs to survive.[8]  A minority of retired footballers continue working full-time in football, for instance as football managers. A 1979 study reported that former first-team ballplayers were over-represented as top-ranking executives in their companies and had greater income mobility than second-teamers and reserves.[9] However, some experience chronic health issues, see below.  In association football, there are four traditional types of specialties (positions): goalkeepers (goalies), defenders (full-backs), midfielders (half-backs), and forwards (attackers). Special purpose positions include such performers as sweepers, stoppers, second forwards (under-attackers), wingers, insiders, etc.  The American football teams' positions are categorized by a form of play where each of them has its spectrum of positions. Those are offensive, defensive, and special teams.  Research shows that association football players who take less than 200 milliseconds after the referee blows their whistle to make a penalty kick are significantly less likely to score than those who take over a second.[16][17]  An Irish 2002 study of association and Gaelic football players characterized players as \"lean and muscular with a reasonably high level of capacity in all areas of physical performance\".[18] The opposite is the case for American football, where obesity could be the cause of grave health problems.[19]  A 2000 study documented injuries sustained by Czech [association] football players at all levels:[20]  Trauma was the cause of 81.5% of the injuries, and overuse was the cause of 18.5%. Joint sprains predominated (30%), followed by fractures (16%), muscle strains (15%), ligament ruptures (12%), meniscal tears and contusions (8%), and other injuries. Injuries to the knee were most prevalent (29%), followed by injuries to the ankle (19%) and spine (9%). More injuries occurred during games (59%) than in practice. [21] Patellar tendinitis (knee pain) is considered an injury that comes from overexertion, which also happens to other athletes of virtually every sport. It is a common problem that football players develop and can usually be treated by a quadriceps strengthening program. Jumping activities place particularly high strains on the tendon and with repetitive jumping, tearing and injury of the tendon can occur. The chronic injury and healing response results in inflammation and localized pain.[22]  Although levels of depression and pain in retired football players are on par with the societal average,[23] some players suffer from post-retirement chronic injuries. Head injuries are a particular concern.  Studies have long shown former American football NFL players have a longer life expectancy than the general public or males with a similar age and race distribution, but a higher rate of cardiovascular issues.[24] A study comparing the deaths of former Major League Baseball players found baseball players lived longer still, perhaps suggesting a \"healthy worker\" bias where NFL athletes lived less long than they would otherwise have, despite their longer than average life expectancy.[25]  A 2009 review of the evidence in the American Journal of Medicine concluded the existing evidence \"did not suggest an increased mortality\" but does \"suggest increased cardiovascular risk..., particularly the heavier linemen.\"[26]  In association football, a 2011 German study found that German national team players lived 1.9 years less than the general male population.[27]  Football players participating in international matches for Germany have reduced longevity compared to the general population. This disadvantage was the larger, the earlier the international football player started his international career. This finding is in line with the current knowledge of life expectancy in major athletes, especially those from other team sports A 1983 study of rugby players found that the life expectancy of All Blacks was the same as for the general population.[28]  Australian rules footballers have lower death rates than the general population.[29]  American football players are prone to head injuries such as concussions. In later life, this increases the risk of dementia[30] and Alzheimer's.[31] Professional American football players self-reporting concussions are at greater risk for having depressive episodes later in life compared with those retired players self-reporting no concussions.[32][33]  Probably due to the repeated trauma associated with heading balls, professional association football has been suggested to increase the incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[34] In a 1987 study of former Norwegian association football national team players, one third of the players were found to have central cerebral atrophy, i.e. brain damage.[35] A 1999 study connected soccer to chronic traumatic head injury (CTHI):[36]  [P]articipation in amateur association football in general and concussion specifically is associated with impaired performance in memory and planning functions. Due to the worldwide popularity of soccer, these observations may have important public health implications Anterior cruciate ligaments are particularly vulnerable in most types of football due to injuries that can be sustained during tackles.  An increased incidence of osteoarthritis in the hip joint has been found in retired football players.[37]  A 2012 study of association football injuries found that 19% of all injuries were muscle injuries, of which 54% affected the thigh muscles.[38]  In a 2009 study, association football was found to be associated with favourable sleep patterns and psychological functioning in adolescent male football players.[39]  The rate of suicide among NFL vets has been found to be 59% lower than in the general population.[40]  In 2012, FIFA released a paper intended to identify key risk factors for association football players.[41]  In 2015, a systematic review of a sample of fifty-four peer-reviewed publications and three articles on elite athletes\u2019 mortality and longevity, resulted in major longevity outcomes for the elite athletes (baseball, football, soccer, basketball, and cycling) \"compared to age and sex-matched controls from the general population and other athletes.\" The span longevities were influenced by factors like the type of sport, the playing position, the race, and the energy system.[42]  An observational study held from professional footballers -active (during their career) and recently retired (post-career, aged more than 45 years)- in 70 countries between 2007 and 2013, elaborated on data from the World Footballers' Union (FIFPro), recorded 214 deaths of which 25% was caused by accidents, 11% by suicides and 33% by a suspected cardiac pathology (on an overall 55% of deaths caused by some sort of disease).[43]  Clinical evaluation, ECG , and echocardiography are required for the athletes as pre-participation tools in order to prevent sudden cardiac deaths in people aged less than 35. To evaluate the risk of myocardial fibrosis, may use and recommend the additional use of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) with pre- and post-contrast and extracellular volume fraction (ECV) images.[44] Even encouraged, it wasn't yet made mandatory.  In 2015, 205 deaths among North American professional athletes who were registered as active at the time of their decease were analysed. Data were collected for the four major sports: National Basketball Association (NBA), National Football League (NFL), National Hockey League (NHL), and Major League Baseball (MLB). The NFL and NBA active players had \"a higher likelihood of dying in a car accident\" and a significantly higher likelihood of dying from a cardiac-related illness compared to the NHL and MLB active populations.[45]  In 2013, a study on 3,439 retired athletes of the National Football Leagues with at least five credited playing seasons between 1959 and 1988 did not show a statistical correlation between suicide mortality and professional activity, particularly football-related compared with the general control sample. No stratification was reported between speed and non-speed position players.[46]  Until the 2000s a very limited number of formal studies has been published on mortality from all causes in soccer players, despite the high interest of the public to the matter. An extended study held in Italy between 1975 and 2003 on a total of 5.389 players, aged 14\u201335 years, highlighted that, while the mortality for cancer and cardiovascular diseases among the football players cohort was significantly lower than the general Italian population, the \"mortality rates for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and car accidents were significantly higher than expected, and for ALS the risk is 18 times than expected.\"[47] "},{"title":"United States soccer league system","content":"  The United States soccer league system is a series of professional and amateur soccer leagues based, in whole or in part, in the United States. Sometimes called the American soccer pyramid, teams and leagues are not linked by the system of promotion and relegation typical in soccer elsewhere. Instead, the United States Soccer Federation (USSF or U.S. Soccer) defines professional leagues in three levels, called divisions, with all other leagues sanctioned by the USSF not having an official designated level or division.  For practical and historical reasons, some teams from Bermuda, Canada, and Puerto Rico (considered a separate country by FIFA) can also compete in these leagues. However, these teams are not eligible for the U.S. Open Cup and cannot represent the United States in the CONCACAF Champions Cup because they are not affiliated with U.S. Soccer.  No professional league in any of the major pro sports leagues in the U.S. or Canada, including the professional soccer leagues, currently uses a system of promotion and relegation.[1] The country's governing body for the sport, the United States Soccer Federation (also known as the USSF or U.S. Soccer), oversees the league system and is responsible for sanctioning professional leagues. The leagues themselves are responsible for admitting and administering individual teams. Amateur soccer in the United States is regulated by the United States Adult Soccer Association (USASA), the only amateur soccer organization sanctioned by the USSF. Automatic promotion and relegation between its leagues, as exists in many other national league systems, was considered by United Soccer League, but was never implemented; although voluntary promotion and relegation has occurred.[2] Some amateur leagues sanctioned by the USASA also use promotion and relegation systems within multiple levels of their leagues. However, there has never been a merit-based promotion system offered to the USASA's \"national\" leagues, the NPSL and League Two.  College soccer in the United States is sanctioned by bodies outside the direct control of the USSF, the most important of which is the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). See NCAA Division I women's soccer programs, NCAA Division I men's soccer programs, and NCAA Division II men's soccer programs for a list of college soccer programs in the United States.  The standards for Division I, II and III leagues are set by the USSF.[3]  Ownership requirements  Market requirements  Financial viability  Media  Team organization  League operations  In addition to the required positions filled by full-time staff, the league office must have full-time staff performing the functions of a chief operations officer, a chief financial officer and a director of marketing\/public relations on a year-round basis  Ownership requirements  Markets and stadia  Ownership requirements  Markets and stadia  Since 1996, Major League Soccer (MLS) has been the only sanctioned USSF Division I men's outdoor soccer league in the United States. MLS has grown from 10 teams in 1996 to 29 teams as of the 2023 season.  The USL Championship (USLC) is the only sanctioned Division II men's outdoor soccer league as of 2021. Formed in 2010 as a result of the merger of the former USL First Division and USL Second Division, the USL Championship was sanctioned as Division III league from 2011 to 2016 before becoming provisionally sanctioned as a Division II league for 2017,[5] and receiving full Division II sanctioning in 2018.[6]  The USL Championship expanded almost three-fold since its first season in 2011 to include 35 teams in the 2020 season, with the league divided into two conferences, Eastern and Western. After that season, held amid the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, five teams left the league.  The previously Division II North American Soccer League (NASL) was formed in 2009, but did not debut until 2011 following the controversial 2010 season that saw neither the USL First Division nor the NASL receive Division II sanctioning from the USSF, resulting in the temporary USSF Division 2 Pro League. NASL was sanctioned as a Division II league from 2011 to 2016; when it fielded 8 teams for the 2017 season, U.S. Soccer only granted the league provisional sanctioning as it fell under the 12-team requirement.[7] The USSF rejected the NASL's application to maintain provisional Division II status for the 2018 season as the NASL did not present a plan[8] on how it would meet the Division II criteria.[9] In response, the NASL filed \"a federal antitrust suit against the U.S. Soccer Federation\"[10] in an attempt to force USSF to drop all Division designations. Due to the continuing litigation against U.S. Soccer, the NASL then had to postpone its season to August 2018 and lost four more teams in the process.  In March 2017, United Soccer League announced following the sanctioning of the USL Championship as a Division II league it would start a new tier in its professional structure.[11][12] USL League One received sanctioning in December 2018 and conducted its first season in 2019 with 10 teams. The league expanded to include 12 teams for its second season in 2020 and further expansion had been planned prior to the 2021 season, but was delayed until 2022 or later by COVID-19.  A second Division III league, National Independent Soccer Association (NISA) debuted in August 2019 with eight teams. The league initially played a fall-to-spring season spanning two calendar years but switched to the standard U.S. schedule in 2022.  In September 2015, it was reported that the USSF was proposing the addition of eligibility requirements for sanctioned Division I soccer leagues, including that they must have at least 16 teams, stadiums with a capacity of at least 15,000, and at least 75% of the teams must be in cities that have a population of at least 2 million.[13]  In 2018, the National Premier Soccer League (NPSL), a nationwide amateur league announced the intention to set up a professional division, NPSL Pro. As part of the announcement, NPSL initiated a single season competition, the NPSL Founders Cup, involving 11 teams that will form the new professional league in 2020. As of 2022 this has not materialized and NPSL remains an amateur league.[14]  Below is a list of the number of teams[15] sanctioned by the USSF in the so-called \"modern era\" under the division sanctioning scheme described above.  The USSF does not officially recognize distinctions beyond the three professional divisions above. Currently, three other national leagues are sanctioned by the US Soccer Federation and one of those, the National Premier Soccer League (NPSL), is part of USASA which is a national association member of the USSF and the only[16] member of the Adult Council. USL League Two (USL 2) is a national league run by the USL. Both are recognized in practical terms as playing at a higher level and both since 2020 are considered national leagues earning automatic berths to the US Open Cup first round based on their previous season's league results rather than going through local qualifying.[17] The United Premier Soccer League (UPSL) is also recognized by the USSF as a National Affiliate, but does not gain automatic entry to the Open Cup through the National League track, instead going through local qualifiers.  Additionally, clubs in USL2, UPSL and NPSL pay some of their players and are more accurately described as semi-professional leagues.[citation needed]  USL League Two takes place during the summer months, and has age restrictions.[18] Thus, the player pool is drawn mainly from NCAA college soccer players seeking to continue playing high level soccer during their summer break, while still maintaining their college eligibility.[19] The National Premier Soccer League is similar to USL2 and also attracts top amateur talent from around the United States. However, unlike USL2, the NPSL does not have any age limits or restrictions, thus incorporating both college players and former professional players.[citation needed]. The United Premier Soccer League takes place year round with two seasons, one in spring and one in fall. Unlike USL2 and NPSL, the UPSL does not rely on college players and is the national league with the most diverse participation.  The table below shows the current structure of the system. For each division, its official name, sponsorship name, number of clubs and conferences\/divisions are given. The United States Soccer Federation regulates the standards for a league or division to be recognized as professional, while also determining the level of division for each league.[20]  Division   I  Major League Soccer 29 clubs \u2013 2 conferences[m 1]  II  USL Championship 24 clubs \u2013 2 conferences[m 1]  III  MLS Next Pro29 clubs \u2013 2 conferences[m 1]  National IndependentSoccer Association9 clubs  USL League One 12 clubs  The system is only defined as far as Division 3. Some semi-professional leagues refer to themselves as fourth division, however any tier or division numbers are not recognized for these leagues as U.S. Soccer does not designate a division number nor directly sanction anything below Division 3.[21] What follows is a list of additional notable leagues.

It was replaced in 2009 with Women's Professional Soccer. WPS closed after the 2011 season due to a dispute with owners, and the WPSL Elite League was the de facto top tier of women's soccer in 2012. In November 2012 the National Women's Soccer League, sponsored by the United States Soccer Federation, the Canadian Soccer Association and the Mexican Football Federation was announced.[22] The league started play in April 2013. Mexico withdrew from sponsorship of the NWSL once it established its own women's league in 2017.  For many years, there were two leagues that acted as an unofficial lower division. The United Soccer Leagues ran the W-League from 1995 to 2015.[23][24] The Women's Premier Soccer League (WPSL) was founded in 1998.[25]  Almost immediately following the demise of the W-League, United Women's Soccer was founded with orphan W-League teams and WPSL breakaways.[26] UWS then formed a U23 reserve league, UWS2, in early 2020.[27]  After the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup, USL began exploring the idea of creating a professional league to directly compete with NWSL.[28] This effort was scaled back to running an amateur revival of the W-League, which would operate beneath the DII Women's Independent Soccer League (WISL) (operated by NISA) and a planned DIII league run by UWS.[29] The amateur USL W League was officially revived in June 2021, called by USL as \"pre-professional\",[30] and three months later, plans for a new USL Super League were announced, initially at Division II status in direct competition to WISL, both of which aimed to launch in 2023.[31][32] USL later announced it would instead pursue Division I sanctioning for the USL Super League, launching with eight teams in 2024 and an additional five teams in 2025.[33]  While there was never official distinction between the national amateur leagues, it was commonly assumed that the W-League was a higher quality than WPSL.[citation needed] Two W-League teams had effectively promoted into the first division \u2013 the Buffalo Flash becoming the Western New York Flash in 2011 and D.C. United Women becoming the Washington Spirit in 2013 \u2013 while no WPSL teams have ever done so. UWS, as W-League's spiritual successor, has strengthened this image of being the higher-quality amateur league by attracting four teams that had been associated with WPSL Elite.

The islands fall into two main groups, based on their proximity to the mainland: the Inner and Outer Hebrides.   These islands have a long history of occupation (dating back to the Mesolithic period), and the culture of the inhabitants has been successively influenced by the cultures of Celtic-speaking, Norse-speaking, and English-speaking peoples. This diversity is reflected in the various names given to the islands, which are derived from the different languages that have been spoken there at various points in their history.  The Hebrides are where much of Scottish Gaelic literature and Gaelic music has historically originated. Today, the economy of the islands is dependent on crofting, fishing, tourism, the oil industry, and renewable energy. The Hebrides have less biodiversity than mainland Scotland, but a significant number of seals and seabirds.  The islands have a combined area of 7,285\u00a0km2 (2,813\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), and, as of 2011[update], a combined population of around 45,000.[1]  The Hebrides have a diverse geology, ranging in age from Precambrian strata that are amongst the oldest rocks in Europe, to Paleogene igneous intrusions.[2][3][Note 1] Raised shore platforms in the Hebrides have been identified as strandflats, possibly formed during the Pliocene period and later modified by the Quaternary glaciations.[4]  The Hebrides can be divided into two main groups, separated from one another by the Minch to the north and the Sea of the Hebrides to the south. The Inner Hebrides lie closer to mainland Scotland and include Islay, Jura, Skye, Mull, Raasay, Staffa and the Small Isles. There are 36 inhabited islands in this group. The Outer Hebrides form a chain of more than 100 islands and small skerries located about 70\u00a0km (45\u00a0mi) west of mainland Scotland. Among them, 15 are inhabited. The main inhabited islands include Lewis and Harris, North Uist, Benbecula, South Uist, and Barra.   A complication is that there are various descriptions of the scope of the Hebrides. The Collins Encyclopedia of Scotland describes the Inner Hebrides as lying \"east of the Minch\". This definition would encompass all offshore islands, including those that lie in the sea lochs, such as Eilean B\u00e0n and Eilean Donan, which might not ordinarily be described as \"Hebridean\". However, no formal definition exists.[5][6]  In the past, the Outer Hebrides were often referred to as the Long Isle (Scottish Gaelic: An t-Eilean Fada). Today, they are also sometimes known as the Western Isles, although this phrase can also be used to refer to the Hebrides in general.[Note 2]  The Hebrides have a cool, temperate climate that is remarkably mild and steady for such a northerly latitude, due to the influence of the Gulf Stream. In the Outer Hebrides, the average temperature is 6\u00a0\u00b0C (44\u00a0\u00b0F) in January and 14\u00a0\u00b0C (57\u00a0\u00b0F) in the summer. The average annual rainfall in Lewis is 1,100\u00a0mm (43\u00a0in), and there are between 1,100 and 1,200 hours of sunshine per annum (13%). The summer days are relatively long, and May through August is the driest period.[8]  The earliest surviving written references to the islands were made circa 77\u00a0AD by Pliny the Elder in his Natural History: He states that there are 30 Hebudes, and makes a separate reference to Dumna, which Watson (1926) concluded refers unequivocally to the Outer Hebrides. About 80 years after Pliny the Elder, in 140\u2013150\u00a0AD, Ptolemy (drawing on accounts of the naval expeditions of Agricola) writes that there are five Ebudes (possibly meaning the Inner Hebrides) and Dumna.[9][10][11] Later texts in classical Latin, by writers such as Solinus, use the forms Hebudes and H\u00e6budes.[12]  The name Ebudes (used by Ptolemy) may be pre-Celtic.[11] Ptolemy calls Islay \u201cEpidion\u201d,[13] and the use of the letter \"p\" suggests a Brythonic or Pictish tribal name, Epidii,[14] because the root is not Gaelic.[15] Woolf (2012) has suggested that Ebudes may be \"an Irish attempt to reproduce the word Epidii phonetically, rather than by translating it\", and that the tribe's name may come from the root epos, meaning \"horse\".[16] Watson (1926) also notes a possible relationship between Ebudes and the ancient Irish Ulaid tribal name Ibdaig, and also the personal name of a king Iubd\u00e1n (recorded in the Silva Gadelica).[11]  The names of other individual islands reflect their complex linguistic history. The majority are Norse or Gaelic, but the roots of several other names for Hebrides islands may have a pre-Celtic origin.[11] Adomn\u00e1n, a 7th-century abbot of Iona, records Colonsay as Colosus and Tiree as Ethica, and both of these may be pre-Celtic names.[17] The etymology of Skye is complex and may also include a pre-Celtic root.[15] Lewis is Ljo\u00f0h\u00fas in Old Norse. Various suggestions have been made as to possible meanings of the name in Norse (for example, \"song house\"),[18] but the name is not of Gaelic origin, and the Norse provenance is questionable.[15]  The earliest comprehensive written list of Hebridean island names was compiled by Donald Monro in 1549. This list also provides the earliest written reference to the names of some of the islands.   The derivations of all the inhabited islands of the Hebrides and some of the larger uninhabited ones are listed below.  Lewis and Harris is the largest island in Scotland and the third largest of the British Isles, after Great Britain and Ireland.[19] It incorporates Lewis in the north and Harris in the south, both of which are frequently referred to as individual islands, although they are joined by a land border. The island does not have a single common name in either English or Gaelic and is referred to as \"Lewis and Harris\", \"Lewis with Harris\", \"Harris with Lewis\" etc. For this reason it is treated as two separate islands below.[20] The derivation of Lewis may be pre-Celtic (see above) and the origin of Harris is no less problematic. In the Ravenna Cosmography, Erimon may refer to Harris[21] (or possibly the Outer Hebrides as a whole). This word may derive from the Ancient Greek: \u1f10\u03c1\u1fc6\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 (erimos \"desert\".[22] The origin of Uist (Old Norse: \u00cdvist) is similarly unclear.[15]  There are various examples of earlier names for Inner Hebridean islands that were Gaelic, but these names have since been completely replaced. For example, Adomn\u00e1n records Sainea, Elena, Ommon and Oideacha in the Inner Hebrides. These names presumably passed out of usage in the Norse era, and the locations of the islands they refer to are not clear.[34] As an example of the complexity: Rona may originally have had a Celtic name, then later a similar-sounding Norse name, and then still later a name that was essentially Gaelic again, but with a Norse \"\u00f8y\" or \"ey\" ending.[35] (See Rona, below.)  The names of uninhabited islands follow the same general patterns as the inhabited islands. (See the list, below, of the ten largest islands in the Hebrides and their outliers.)  The etymology of the name \u201cSt Kilda\u201d, a small archipelago west of the Outer Hebrides, and the name of its main island, \u201cHirta,\u201d is very complex. No saint is known by the name of Kilda, so various other theories have been proposed for the word's origin, which dates from the late 16th century.[81] Haswell-Smith (2004) notes that the full name \"St Kilda\" first appears on a Dutch map dated 1666, and that it may derive from the Norse phrase sunt kelda (\"sweet wellwater\") or from a mistaken Dutch assumption that the spring Tobar Childa was dedicated to a saint. (Tobar Childa is a tautological placename, consisting of the Gaelic and Norse words for well, i.e., \"well well\").[82] Similarly unclear is the origin of the Gaelic for \"Hirta\", Hiort, Hirt, or Irt[83] a name for the island that long pre-dates the name \"St Kilda\". Watson (1926) suggests that it may derive from the Old Irish word hirt (\"death\"), possibly a reference to the often lethally dangerous surrounding sea.[84] Maclean (1977) notes that an Icelandic saga about an early 13th-century voyage to Ireland refers to \u201cthe islands of Hirtir\u201d, which means \"stags\" in Norse, and suggests that the outline of the island of Hirta resembles the shape of a stag, speculating that therefore the name \u201cHirta\u201d may be a reference to the island's shape.[85]  The etymology of the names of small islands may be no less complex and elusive. In relation to Dubh Artach, Robert Louis Stevenson believed that \"black and dismal\" was one translation of the name, noting that \"as usual, in Gaelic, it is not the only one.\"[86]  The Hebrides were settled during the Mesolithic era around 6500\u00a0BC or earlier, after the climatic conditions improved enough to sustain human settlement. Occupation at a site on R\u00f9m is dated to 8590 \u00b195 uncorrected radiocarbon years BP, which is amongst the oldest evidence of occupation in Scotland.[97][98] There are many examples of structures from the Neolithic period, the finest example being the standing stones at Callanish, dating to the 3rd millennium BC.[99] Cladh Hallan, a Bronze Age settlement on South Uist is the only site in the UK where prehistoric mummies have been found.[100][101]  In 55\u00a0BC, the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus wrote that there was an island called Hyperborea (which means \"beyond the North Wind\"), where a round temple stood from which the moon appeared only a little distance above the earth every 19 years. This may have been a reference to the stone circle at Callanish.[102]  A traveller called Demetrius of Tarsus related to Plutarch the tale of an expedition to the west coast of Scotland in or shortly before 83\u00a0AD. He stated it was a gloomy journey amongst uninhabited islands, but he had visited one which was the retreat of holy men. He mentioned neither the druids nor the name of the island.[103]  The first written records of native life begin in the 6th century AD, when the founding of the kingdom of D\u00e1l Riata took place.[104] This encompassed roughly what is now Argyll and Bute and Lochaber in Scotland and County Antrim in Ireland.[105] The figure of Columba looms large in any history of D\u00e1l Riata, and his founding of a monastery on Iona ensured that the kingdom would be of great importance in the spread of Christianity in northern Britain. However, Iona was far from unique. Lismore in the territory of the Cen\u00e9l Loairn, was sufficiently important for the death of its abbots to be recorded with some frequency and many smaller sites, such as on Eigg, Hinba, and Tiree, are known from the annals.[106]  North of D\u00e1l Riata, the Inner and Outer Hebrides were nominally under Pictish control, although the historical record is sparse. Hunter (2000) states that in relation to King Bridei I of the Picts in the sixth century: \"As for Shetland, Orkney, Skye and the Western Isles, their inhabitants, most of whom appear to have been Pictish in culture and speech at this time, are likely to have regarded Bridei as a fairly distant presence.\u201d[107]  Viking raids began on Scottish shores towards the end of the 8th century, and the Hebrides came under Norse control and settlement during the ensuing decades, especially following the success of Harald Fairhair at the Battle of Hafrsfjord in 872.[108][109] In the Western Isles Ketill Flatnose may have been the dominant figure of the mid 9th century, by which time he had amassed a substantial island realm and made a variety of alliances with other Norse leaders. These princelings nominally owed allegiance to the Norwegian crown, although in practice the latter's control was fairly limited.[110] Norse control of the Hebrides was formalised in 1098 when Edgar of Scotland formally signed the islands over to Magnus III of Norway.[111] The Scottish acceptance of Magnus III as King of the Isles came after the Norwegian king had conquered Orkney, the Hebrides and the Isle of Man in a swift campaign earlier the same year, directed against the local Norwegian leaders of the various island petty kingdoms. By capturing the islands Magnus imposed a more direct royal control, although at a price. His skald Bjorn Cripplehand recorded that in Lewis \"fire played high in the heaven\" as \"flame spouted from the houses\" and that in the Uists \"the king dyed his sword red in blood\".[111][Note 5]  The Hebrides were now part of the Kingdom of the Isles, whose rulers were themselves vassals of the Kings of Norway. This situation lasted until the partitioning of the Western Isles in 1156, at which time the Outer Hebrides remained under Norwegian control while the Inner Hebrides broke out under Somerled, the Norse-Gael kinsman of the Manx royal house.[113]  Following the ill-fated 1263 expedition of Haakon IV of Norway, the Outer Hebrides and the Isle of Man were yielded to the Kingdom of Scotland as a result of the 1266 Treaty of Perth.[114] Although their contribution to the islands can still be found in personal and place names, the archaeological record of the Norse period is very limited. The best known find is the Lewis chessmen, which date from the mid 12th century.[115]  As the Norse era drew to a close, the Norse-speaking princes were gradually replaced by Gaelic-speaking clan chiefs including the MacLeods of Lewis and Harris, Clan Donald and MacNeil of Barra.[116][117][Note 6] This transition did little to relieve the islands of internecine strife although by the early 14th century the MacDonald Lords of the Isles, based on Islay, were in theory these chiefs' feudal superiors and managed to exert some control.[121]  The Lords of the Isles ruled the Inner Hebrides as well as part of the Western Highlands as subjects of the King of Scots until John MacDonald, fourth Lord of the Isles, squandered the family's powerful position. A rebellion by his nephew, Alexander of Lochalsh provoked an exasperated James IV to forfeit the family's lands in 1493.[122]  In 1598, King James VI authorised some \"Gentleman Adventurers\" from Fife to civilise the \"most barbarous Isle of Lewis\".[123] Initially successful, the colonists were driven out by local forces commanded by Murdoch and Neil MacLeod, who based their forces on Bearasaigh in Loch R\u00f2g. The colonists tried again in 1605 with the same result, but a third attempt in 1607 was more successful and in due course Stornoway became a Burgh of Barony.[123][124] By this time, Lewis was held by the Mackenzies of Kintail (later the Earls of Seaforth), who pursued a more enlightened approach, investing in fishing in particular. The Seaforths' royalist inclinations led to Lewis becoming garrisoned during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms by Cromwell's troops, who destroyed the old castle in Stornoway.[125]  With the implementation of the Treaty of Union in 1707, the Hebrides became part of the new Kingdom of Great Britain, but the clans' loyalties to a distant monarch were not strong. A considerable number of islesmen \"came out\" in support of the Jacobite Earl of Mar in the 1715 and again in the 1745 rising including Macleod of Dunvegan and MacLea of Lismore.[127][128] The aftermath of the decisive Battle of Culloden, which effectively ended Jacobite hopes of a Stuart restoration, was widely felt.[129] The British government's strategy was to estrange the clan chiefs from their kinsmen and turn their descendants into English-speaking landlords whose main concern was the revenues their estates brought rather than the welfare of those who lived on them.[130] This may have brought peace to the islands, but in the following century it came at a terrible price. In the wake of the rebellion, the clan system was broken up and islands of the Hebrides became a series of landed estates.[130][131]  The early 19th century was a time of improvement and population growth. Roads and quays were built; the slate industry became a significant employer on Easdale and surrounding islands; and the construction of the Crinan and Caledonian canals and other engineering works such as Clachan Bridge improved transport and access.[132] However, in the mid-19th century, the inhabitants of many parts of the Hebrides were devastated by the Clearances, which destroyed communities throughout the Highlands and Islands as the human populations were evicted and replaced with sheep farms.[133] The position was exacerbated by the failure of the islands' kelp industry that thrived from the 18th century until the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815[134][135] and large scale emigration became endemic.[136]  As Iain Mac Fhearchair, a Gaelic poet from South Uist, wrote for his countrymen who were obliged to leave the Hebrides in the late 18th century, emigration was the only alternative to \"sinking into slavery\" as the Gaels had been unfairly dispossessed by rapacious landlords.[137] In the 1880s, the \"Battle of the Braes\" involved a demonstration against unfair land regulation and eviction, stimulating the calling of the Napier Commission. Disturbances continued until the passing of the 1886 Crofters' Act.[138]  The residents of the Hebrides have spoken a variety of different languages during the long period of human occupation.  It is assumed that Pictish must once have predominated in the northern Inner Hebrides and Outer Hebrides.[107][139] The Scottish Gaelic language arrived from Ireland due to the growing influence of the kingdom of D\u00e1l Riata from the 6th century AD onwards, and became the dominant language of the southern Hebrides at that time.[140][141] For a few centuries, the military might of the Gall-Gh\u00e0idheil meant that Old Norse was prevalent in the Hebrides. North of Ardnamurchan, the place names that existed prior to the 9th century have been all but obliterated.[141] The Old Norse name for the Hebrides during the Viking occupation was Su\u00f0reyjar, which means \"Southern Isles\"; in contrast to the Nor\u00f0reyjar, or \"Northern Isles\" of Orkney and Shetland.[142]  South of Ardnamurchan, Gaelic place names are more common,[141] and after the 13th century, Gaelic became the main language of the entire Hebridean archipelago. Due to Scots and English being favoured in government and the educational system, the Hebrides have been in a state of diglossia since at least the 17th century. The Highland Clearances of the 19th century accelerated the language shift away from Scottish Gaelic, as did increased migration and the continuing lower status of Gaelic speakers.[143] Nevertheless, as late as the end of the 19th century, there were significant populations of monolingual Gaelic speakers, and the Hebrides still contain the highest percentages of Gaelic speakers in Scotland. This is especially true of the Outer Hebrides, where a slim majority speak the language.[143][144] The Scottish Gaelic college, Sabhal M\u00f2r Ostaig, is based on Skye and Islay.[145]  Ironically, given the status of the Western Isles as the last Gaelic-speaking stronghold in Scotland, the Gaelic language name for the islands \u2013 Innse Gall \u2013 means \"isles of the foreigners\"; from the time when they were under Norse colonisation.[146]  For those who remained, new economic opportunities emerged through the export of cattle, commercial fishing and tourism.[147] Nonetheless, emigration and military service became the choice of many[148] and the archipelago's populations continued to dwindle throughout the late 19th century and for much of the 20th century.[149][150] Lengthy periods of continuous occupation notwithstanding, many of the smaller islands were abandoned.[151]  There were, however, continuing gradual economic improvements, among the most visible of which was the replacement of the traditional thatched blackhouse with accommodation of a more modern design[152] and with the assistance of Highlands and Islands Enterprise many of the islands' populations have begun to increase after decades of decline.[1] The discovery of substantial deposits of North Sea oil in 1965 and the renewables sector have contributed to a degree of economic stability in recent decades. For example, the Arnish yard has had a chequered history but has been a significant employer in both the oil and renewables industries.[153]  The widespread immigration of mainlanders, particularly non-Gaelic speakers, has been a subject of controversy.[154][155]   Agriculture practised by crofters remained popular in the 21st century in the Hebrides; crofters own a small property but often share a large common grazing area. Various types of funding are available to crofters to help supplement their incomes, including the \"Basic Payment Scheme, the suckler beef support scheme, the upland sheep support scheme and the Less Favoured Area support scheme\". One reliable source discussed the Crofting Agricultural Grant Scheme (CAGS) in March 2020:[156] the scheme \"pays up to \u00a325,000 per claim in any two-year period, covering 80% of investment costs for those who are under 41 and have had their croft less than five years. Older, more established crofters can get 60% grants\". Many contemporary Gaelic musicians have roots in the Hebrides, including vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Julie Fowlis (North Uist),[157] Catherine-Ann MacPhee (Barra), Kathleen MacInnes of the band Capercaillie (South Uist), and Ishbel MacAskill (Lewis). All of these singers have composed their own music in Scottish Gaelic, with much of their repertoire stemming from Hebridean vocal traditions, such as puirt \u00e0 beul (\u201cmouth music\u201d, similar to Irish lilting) and \u00f2rain luaidh (waulking songs). This tradition includes many songs composed by little-known or anonymous poets, well-before the 1800s, such as \"Fear a' bh\u00e0ta\", \"Ailein duinn\", \"H\u00f9g air a\u2019 bhonaid mh\u00f2ir\" and \"Alasdair mhic Cholla Ghasda\". Several of Runrig's songs are inspired by the archipelago; Calum and Ruaraidh D\u00f2mhnallach were raised on North Uist[158] and Donnie Munro on Skye.[159]  The fiddle and violin company Skyinbow is named-after and based in Skye. Their instruments have been played by musicians such as Mairead Nesbitt, Cora Smyth and Eileen Ivers, and have been featured in productions such as Michael Flatley\u2019s Lord of the Dance, Feet of Flames, and Riverdance.  The Gaelic poet Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair spent much of his life in the Hebrides and often referred to them in his poetry, including in An Airce and Birlinn Chlann Raghnaill.[160] The best known Gaelic poet of her era, M\u00e0iri Mh\u00f2r nan \u00d2ran (Mary MacPherson, 1821\u201398), embodied the spirit of the land agitation of the 1870s and 1880s. This, and her powerful evocation of the Hebrides\u2014she was from Skye\u2014has made her among the most enduring Gaelic poets.[161] Allan MacDonald (1859\u20131905), who spent his adult life on Eriskay and South Uist, composed hymns and verse in honour of the Blessed Virgin, the Christ Child, and the Eucharist. In his secular poetry, MacDonald praised the beauty of Eriskay and its people. In his verse drama, Parlamaid nan Cailleach (The Old Wives' Parliament), he lampooned the gossiping of his female parishioners and local marriage customs.[162]  In the 20th century, Murdo Macfarlane of Lewis wrote C\u00e0nan nan G\u00e0idheal, a well-known poem about the Gaelic revival in the Outer Hebrides.[163] Sorley MacLean, the most respected 20th-century Gaelic writer, was born and raised on Raasay, where he set his best known poem, Hallaig, about the devastating effect of the Highland Clearances.[164] Aonghas Ph\u00e0draig Caimbeul, raised on South Uist and described by MacLean as \"one of the few really significant living poets in Scotland, writing in any language\" (West Highland Free Press, October 1992)[165] wrote the Scottish Gaelic-language novel An Oidhche Mus do She\u00f2l Sinn which was voted in the Top Ten of the 100 Best-Ever Books from Scotland.  Virginia Woolf's To The Lighthouse is set on the Isle of Skye, part of the Inner Hebrides.   In some respects the Hebrides lack biodiversity in comparison to mainland Britain; for example, there are only half as many mammalian species.[180] However, these islands provide breeding grounds for many important seabird species including the world's largest colony of northern gannets.[181] Avian life includes the corncrake, red-throated diver, rock dove, kittiwake, tystie, Atlantic puffin, goldeneye, golden eagle and white-tailed sea eagle.[182][183] The latter was re-introduced to R\u00f9m in 1975 and has successfully spread to various neighbouring islands, including Mull.[184] There is a small population of red-billed chough concentrated on the islands of Islay and Colonsay.[185]  Red deer are common on the hills and the grey seal and common seal are present around the coasts of Scotland. Colonies of seals are found on Oronsay and the Treshnish Isles.[186][187] The rich freshwater streams contain brown trout, Atlantic salmon and water shrew.[188][189] Offshore, minke whales, orcas, basking sharks, porpoises and dolphins are among the sealife that can be seen.[190][191]  Heather moor containing ling, bell heather, cross-leaved heath, bog myrtle and fescues is abundant and there is a diversity of Arctic and alpine plants including Alpine pearlwort and mossy cyphal.[192]  Loch Druidibeg on South Uist is a national nature reserve owned and managed by Scottish Natural Heritage. The reserve covers 1,677 hectares across the whole range of local habitats.[193] Over 200 species of flowering plants have been recorded on the reserve, some of which are nationally scarce.[194] South Uist is considered the best place in the UK for the aquatic plant slender naiad, which is a European Protected Species.[195][196]  Hedgehogs are not native to the Outer Hebrides\u2014they were introduced in the 1970s to reduce garden pests\u2014and their spread poses a threat to the eggs of ground nesting wading birds. In 2003, Scottish Natural Heritage undertook culls of hedgehogs in the area although these were halted in 2007 due to protests. Trapped animals were relocated to the mainland.[197][198]  57\u00b000\u2032N 07\u00b000\u2032W\ufeff \/ \ufeff57.000\u00b0N 7.000\u00b0W\ufeff \/ 57.000; -7.000 "},{"title":"Scots language","content":"  Scots[note 1] is an Anglic language variety in the West Germanic language family, spoken in Scotland and parts of Ulster in the north of Ireland (where the local dialect is known as Ulster Scots).[3] Most commonly spoken in the Scottish Lowlands, Northern Isles, and northern Ulster, it is sometimes called Lowland Scots to distinguish it from Scottish Gaelic, the Goidelic Celtic language that was historically restricted to most of the Scottish Highlands, the Hebrides, and Galloway after the sixteenth century;[4] or Broad Scots to distinguish it from Scottish Standard English. Modern Scots is a sister language of Modern English, as the two diverged independently from the same source: Early Middle English (1100\u20131300).[5][6][7]  Scots is recognised as an indigenous language of Scotland by the Scottish government,[8] a regional or minority language of Europe,[9] and a vulnerable language by UNESCO.[10][11] In the 2011 Scottish Census, over 1.5\u00a0million people in Scotland reported being able to speak Scots.[12]  Given that there are no universally accepted criteria for distinguishing a language from a dialect, scholars and other interested parties often disagree about the linguistic, historical and social status of Scots, particularly its relationship to English.[13] Although a number of paradigms for distinguishing between languages and dialects exist, they often render contradictory results. Broad Scots is at one end of a bipolar linguistic continuum, with Scottish Standard English at the other.[14] Scots is sometimes regarded as a variety of English, though it has its own distinct dialects;[13]:\u200a894\u200a other scholars treat Scots as a distinct Germanic language, in the way that Norwegian is closely linked to but distinct from Danish.[13]:\u200a894\u200a  Native speakers sometimes refer to their vernacular as braid Scots (or \"broad Scots\" in English)[15] or use a dialect name such as the \"Doric\"[16] or the \"Buchan Claik\".[17] The old-fashioned Scotch, an English loan,[13]:\u200a892\u200a occurs occasionally, especially in Ulster.[18][19] The term Lallans, a variant of the Modern Scots word lawlands [\u02c8lo\u031c\u02d0l\u0259n(d)z, \u02c8l\u0251\u02d0l\u0259nz],[20] is also used, though this is more often taken to mean the Lallans literary form.[21] Scots in Ireland is known in official circles as Ulster-Scots (Ulst\u00e8r-Scotch in revivalist Ulster-Scots) or \"Ullans\", a recent neologism merging Ulster and Lallans.[22]  Scots is a contraction of Scottis, the Older Scots[15] and northern version of late Old English: Scottisc (modern English \"Scottish\"), which replaced the earlier i-mutated version Scyttisc.[23] Before the end of the fifteenth century, English speech in Scotland was known as \"English\" (written Ynglis or Inglis at the time), whereas \"Scottish\" (Scottis) referred to Gaelic.[24] By the beginning of the fifteenth century, the English language used in Scotland had arguably become a distinct language, albeit one lacking a name which clearly distinguished it from all the other English variants and dialects spoken in Britain. From 1495, the term Scottis was increasingly used to refer to the Lowland vernacular[13]:\u200a894\u200a and Erse, meaning \"Irish\", was used as a name for Gaelic. For example, towards the end of the fifteenth century, William Dunbar was using Erse to refer to Gaelic and, in the early sixteenth century, Gavin Douglas was using Scottis as a name for the Lowland vernacular.[25][26] The Gaelic of Scotland is now usually called Scottish Gaelic.  Northumbrian Old English had been established in what is now southeastern Scotland as far as the River Forth by the seventh century, as the region was part of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria.[30] Middle Irish was the language of the Scottish court, and the common use of Old English remained largely confined to this area until the thirteenth century. The succeeding variety of Northern Early Middle English spoken in southeastern Scotland is also known as Early Scots. It began to further diverge from the Middle English of Northumbria due to twelfth- and thirteenth-century immigration of Scandinavian-influenced Middle English\u2013speakers from the North and Midlands of England.[30]:\u200axliii\u200a Later influences on the development of Scots came from the Romance languages via ecclesiastical and legal Latin, Norman French,[30]:\u200alxiii\u2013lxv\u200a and later Parisian French, due to the Auld Alliance. Additionally, there were Dutch and Middle Low German influences due to trade with and immigration from the Low Countries.[30]:\u200alxiii\u200a Scots also includes loan words in the legal and administrative fields resulting from contact with Middle Irish, and reflected in early medieval legal documents.[30]:\u200alxi\u200a Contemporary Scottish Gaelic loans are mainly for geographical and cultural features, such as c\u00e8ilidh, loch, whisky, glen and clan. Cumbric and Pictish, the medieval Brittonic languages of Northern England and Scotland, are the suspected source of a small number of Scots words, such as lum (derived from Cumbric) meaning \"chimney\".[31] From the thirteenth century, the Early Scots language spread further into Scotland via the burghs, which were proto-urban institutions first established by King David I. In fourteenth-century Scotland, the growth in prestige of Early Scots and the complementary decline of French made Scots the prestige dialect of most of eastern Scotland. By the sixteenth century, Middle Scots had established orthographic and literary norms largely independent of those developing in England.[32]  From 1610 to the 1690s during the Plantation of Ulster, some 200,000 Scots-speaking Lowlanders settled as colonists in Ulster in Ireland.[33][full citation needed] In the core areas of Scots settlement, Scots outnumbered English settlers by five or six to one.[34][full citation needed]  The name Modern Scots is used to describe the Scots language after 1700.[citation needed]  A seminal study of Scots was undertaken by JAH Murray and published as Dialect of the Southern Counties of Scotland.[35] Murray's results were given further publicity by being included in Alexander John Ellis's book On Early English Pronunciation, Part V alongside results from Orkney and Shetland, as well as the whole of England. Murray and Ellis differed slightly on the border between English and Scots dialects.[36]  Scots was studied alongside English and Scots Gaelic in the Linguistic Survey of Scotland at the University of Edinburgh, which began in 1949 and began to publish results in the 1970s.[37] Also beginning in the 1970s, the Atlas Linguarum Europae studied the Scots language used at 15 sites in Scotland, each with its own dialect.[38]  From the mid-sixteenth century, written Scots was increasingly influenced by the developing Standard English of Southern England due to developments in royal and political interactions with England.[32]:\u200a10\u200a When William Flower, an English herald, spoke with Mary of Guise and her councillors in 1560, they first used the \"Scottyshe toung\". As he found this hard to understand, they switched into her native French.[39] King James VI, who in 1603 became James I of England, observed in his work Some Reulis and Cautelis to Be Observit and Eschewit in Scottis Poesie that \"For albeit sindrie hes written of it in English, quhilk is lykest to our language...\" (For though several have written of (the subject) in English, which is the language most similar to ours...). However, with the increasing influence and availability of books printed in England, most writing in Scotland came to be done in the English fashion.[32]:\u200a11\u200a In his first speech to the English Parliament in March 1603, King James VI and I declared, \"Hath not God first united these two Kingdomes both in Language, Religion, and similitude of maners?\".[40] Following James VI's move to London, the Protestant Church of Scotland adopted the 1611 Authorized King James Version of the Bible; subsequently, the Acts of Union 1707 led to Scotland joining England to form the Kingdom of Great Britain, having a single Parliament of Great Britain based in London. After the Union and the shift of political power to England, the use of Scots was discouraged by many in authority and education, as was the notion of \"Scottishness\" itself.[41] Many leading Scots of the period, such as David Hume, defined themselves as Northern British rather than Scottish.[41]:\u200a2\u200a They attempted to rid themselves of their Scots in a bid to establish standard English as the official language of the newly formed union. Nevertheless, Scots was still spoken across a wide range of domains until the end of the eighteenth century.[32]:\u200a11\u200a Frederick Pottle, the twentieth-century biographer of James Boswell (1740\u20131795), described James's view of the use of Scots by his father Alexander Boswell (1706\u20131782) [when?] in the eighteenth century while serving as a judge of the Supreme Courts of Scotland:  He scorned modern literature, spoke broad Scots from the bench, and even in writing took no pains to avoid the Scotticisms which most of his colleagues were coming to regard as vulgar. However, others did scorn Scots, such as Scottish Enlightenment intellectuals David Hume and Adam Smith, who went to great lengths to get rid of every Scotticism from their writings.[42] Following such examples, many well-off Scots took to learning English through the activities of those such as Thomas Sheridan, who in 1761 gave a series of lectures on English elocution. Charging a guinea at a time (about \u00a3200 in today's money[43]), they were attended by over 300 men, and he was made a freeman of the City of Edinburgh. Following this, some of the city's intellectuals formed the Select Society for Promoting the Reading and Speaking of the English Language in Scotland. These eighteenth-century activities would lead to the creation of Scottish Standard English.[32]:\u200a13\u200a Scots remained the vernacular of many rural communities and the growing number of urban working-class Scots.[32]:\u200a14\u200a  In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the use of Scots as a literary language was revived by several prominent Scotsmen[citation needed] such as Robert Burns. Such writers established a new cross-dialect literary norm.  Scots terms were included in the English Dialect Dictionary, edited by Joseph Wright. Wright had great difficulty in recruiting volunteers from Scotland, as many refused to cooperate with a venture that regarded Scots as a dialect of English, and he obtained enough help only through the assistance from a Professor Shearer in Scotland.[44] Wright himself rejected the argument that Scots was a separate language, saying that this was a \"quite modern mistake\".[44]  During the first half of the twentieth century, knowledge of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literary norms waned, and as of 2006[update], there is no institutionalised standard literary form.[45] By the 1940s, the Scottish Education Department's language policy was that Scots had no value: \"it is not the language of 'educated' people anywhere, and could not be described as a suitable medium of education or culture\".[46] Students reverted to Scots outside the classroom, but the reversion was not complete. What occurred, and has been occurring ever since, is a process of language attrition, whereby successive generations have adopted more and more features from Standard English. This process has accelerated rapidly since widespread access to mass media in English and increased population mobility became available after the Second World War.[32]:\u200a15\u200a It has recently taken on the nature of wholesale language shift, sometimes also termed language change, convergence or merger. By the end of the twentieth century, Scots was at an advanced stage of language death over much of Lowland Scotland.[47] Residual features of Scots are often regarded as slang.[48] A 2010 Scottish Government study of \"public attitudes towards the Scots language\" found that 64% of respondents (around 1,000 individuals in a representative sample of Scotland's adult population) \"don't really think of Scots as a language\", also finding \"the most frequent speakers are least likely to agree that it is not a language (58%) and those never speaking Scots most likely to do so (72%)\".[49]  Before the Treaty of Union 1707, when Scotland and England joined to form the Kingdom of Great Britain, there is ample evidence that Scots was widely held to be an independent sister language[50] forming a pluricentric diasystem with English.  German linguist Heinz Kloss considered Modern Scots a Halbsprache ('half language') in terms of an abstand and ausbau languages framework,[51] although today in Scotland most people's speech is somewhere on a continuum ranging from traditional broad Scots to Scottish Standard English. Many speakers are diglossic and may be able to code-switch along the continuum depending on the situation. Where on this continuum English-influenced Scots becomes Scots-influenced English is difficult to determine. Because standard English now generally has the role of a Dachsprache ('roofing language'), disputes often arise as to whether the varieties of Scots are dialects of Scottish English or constitute a separate language in their own right.[52][53]  The UK government now accepts Scots as a regional language and has recognised it as such under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.[54]  Notwithstanding the UK government's and the Scottish Executive's obligations under part II of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, the Scottish Executive recognises and respects Scots (in all its forms) as a distinct language, and does not consider the use of Scots to be an indication of poor competence in English. Evidence for its existence as a separate language lies in the extensive body of Scots literature, its independent \u2013 if somewhat fluid \u2013 orthographic conventions, and in its former use as the language of the original Parliament of Scotland.[55] Because Scotland retained distinct political, legal, and religious systems after the Union, many Scots terms passed into Scottish English.  During the 2010s, increased interest was expressed in the language.  The status of the language was raised in Scottish schools,[56] with Scots being included in the new national school curriculum.[57] Previously in Scotland's schools there had been little education taking place through the medium of Scots, although it may have been covered superficially in English lessons, which could entail reading some Scots literature and observing the local dialect. Much of the material used was often Standard English disguised as Scots, which caused upset among proponents of Standard English and proponents of Scots alike.[58] One example of the educational establishment's approach to Scots is, \"Write a poem in Scots. (It is important not to be worried about spelling in this \u2013 write as you hear the sounds in your head.)\",[59] whereas guidelines for English require teaching pupils to be \"writing fluently and legibly with accurate spelling and punctuation\".[60]  A course in Scots language and culture delivered through the medium of Standard English and produced by the Open University (OU) in Scotland, the Open University's School of Languages and Applied Linguistics as well as Education Scotland became available online for the first time in December 2019.[61]  In the 2011 Scottish census, a question on Scots language ability was featured[8] In 2022 a question regarding the Scots language was also featured.[62][63]  The Scottish government set its first Scots Language Policy in 2015, in which it pledged to support its preservation and encourage respect, recognition and use of Scots.[8] The Scottish Parliament website also offers some information on the language in Scots.[64]  Serious use of the language for news, encyclopaedias, documentaries, etc., remains rare and usually reserved for niches where it is deemed acceptable, e.g. comedy, Burns Night, or representations of traditions and times gone by. However, since 2016 The National newspaper has regularly published some news articles in the language.[65] The 2010s also saw an increasing number of English books translated in Scots and becoming widely available, particularly those in popular children's fiction series such as The Gruffalo, Harry Potter, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, and several by Roald Dahl[66] and David Walliams.[67] In 2021, the music streaming service Spotify created a Scots language listing.[68]  In Scotland, Scots is spoken in the Scottish Lowlands, the Northern Isles, Caithness, Arran and Campbeltown. In Ulster, the northern province in Ireland, its area is usually defined through the works of Robert John Gregg to include the counties of Down, Antrim, Londonderry and Donegal (especially in East Donegal and Inishowen).[69] More recently, the Fintona-born linguist Warren Maguire has argued that some of the criteria that Gregg used as distinctive of Ulster-Scots are common in south-west Tyrone and were found in other sites across Northern Ireland investigated by the Linguistic Survey of Scotland.[70] Dialects of Scots include Insular Scots, Northern Scots, Central Scots, Southern Scots and Ulster Scots.  It has been difficult to determine the number of speakers of Scots via census, because many respondents might interpret the question \"Do you speak Scots?\" in different ways. Campaigners for Scots pressed for this question to be included in the 2001 UK National Census. The results from a 1996 trial before the Census, by the General Register Office for Scotland (GRO),[71] suggested that there were around 1.5\u00a0million speakers of Scots, with 30% of Scots responding \"Yes\" to the question \"Can you speak the Scots language?\", but only 17% responding \"Aye\" to the question \"Can you speak Scots?\".[citation needed] It was also found that older, working-class people were more likely to answer in the affirmative. The University of Aberdeen Scots Leid Quorum performed its own research in 1995, cautiously suggesting that there were 2.7\u00a0million speakers, though with clarification as to why these figures required context.[72]  The GRO questions, as freely acknowledged by those who set them, were not as detailed and systematic as the University of Aberdeen ones, and only included reared speakers (people raised speaking Scots), not those who had learned the language. Part of the difference resulted from the central question posed by surveys: \"Do you speak Scots?\". In the Aberdeen University study, the question was augmented with the further clause \"...\u00a0or a dialect of Scots such as Border etc.\", which resulted in greater recognition from respondents. The GRO concluded that there simply was not enough linguistic self-awareness amongst the Scottish populace, with people still thinking of themselves as speaking badly pronounced, grammatically inferior English rather than Scots, for an accurate census to be taken. The GRO research concluded that \"[a] more precise estimate of genuine Scots language ability would require a more in-depth interview survey and may involve asking various questions about the language used in different situations. Such an approach would be inappropriate for a Census.\" Thus, although it was acknowledged that the \"inclusion of such a Census question would undoubtedly raise the profile of Scots\", no question about Scots was, in the end, included in the 2001 Census.[52][73][74] The Scottish Government's Pupils in Scotland Census 2008[75] found that 306 pupils[clarification needed] spoke Scots as their main home language. A Scottish Government study in 2010 found that 85% of around 1000 respondents (being a representative sample of Scotland's adult population) claim to speak Scots to varying degrees.[49]  The 2011 UK census was the first to ask residents of Scotland about Scots. A campaign called Aye Can was set up to help individuals answer the question.[76][77] The specific wording used was \"Which of these can you do? Tick all that apply\" with options for \"Understand\", \"Speak\", \"Read\" and \"Write\" in three columns: English, Scottish Gaelic and Scots.[78] Of approximately 5.1\u00a0million respondents, about 1.2\u00a0million (24%) could speak, read and write Scots, 3.2\u00a0million (62%) had no skills in Scots and the remainder had some degree of skill, such as understanding Scots (0.27\u00a0million, 5.2%) or being able to speak it but not read or write it (0.18\u00a0million, 3.5%).[79] There were also small numbers of Scots speakers recorded in England and Wales on the 2011 Census, with the largest numbers being either in bordering areas (e.g. Carlisle) or in areas that had recruited large numbers of Scottish workers in the past (e.g. Corby or the former mining areas of Kent).[80]  Among the earliest Scots literature is John Barbour's Brus (fourteenth century), Wyntoun's Cronykil and Blind Harry's The Wallace (fifteenth century). From the fifteenth century, much literature based on the Royal Court in Edinburgh and the University of St Andrews was produced by writers such as Robert Henryson, William Dunbar, Gavin Douglas and David Lyndsay. The Complaynt of Scotland was an early printed work in Scots. The Eneados is a Middle Scots translation of Virgil's Aeneid, completed by Gavin Douglas in 1513.  After the seventeenth century, anglicisation increased. At the time, many of the oral ballads from the borders and the North East were written down. Writers of the period were Robert Sempill, Robert Sempill the younger, Francis Sempill, Lady Wardlaw and Lady Grizel Baillie.  In the eighteenth century, writers such as Allan Ramsay, Robert Burns, James Orr, Robert Fergusson and Walter Scott continued to use Scots \u2013 Burns's \"Auld Lang Syne\" is in Scots, for example. Scott introduced vernacular dialogue to his novels. Other well-known authors like Robert Louis Stevenson, William Alexander, George MacDonald, J. M. Barrie and other members of the Kailyard school like Ian Maclaren also wrote in Scots or used it in dialogue.  In the Victorian era popular Scottish newspapers regularly included articles and commentary in the vernacular, often of unprecedented proportions.[81]  In the early twentieth century, a renaissance in the use of Scots occurred, its most vocal figure being Hugh MacDiarmid whose benchmark poem \"A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle\" (1926) did much to demonstrate the power of Scots as a modern idiom. Other contemporaries were Douglas Young, John Buchan, Sydney Goodsir Smith, Robert Garioch, Edith Anne Robertson and Robert McLellan. The revival extended to verse and other literature.  In 1955, three Ayrshire men \u2013 Sandy MacMillan, an English teacher at Ayr Academy; Thomas Limond, noted town chamberlain of Ayr; and A. L. \"Ross\" Taylor, rector of Cumnock Academy\u00a0\u2013 collaborated to write Bairnsangs (\"Child Songs\"),[82] a collection of children's nursery rhymes and poems in Scots. The book contains a five-page glossary of contemporary Scots words and their pronunciations.  Alexander Gray's translations into Scots constitute the greater part of his work, and are the main basis for his reputation.  In 1983, William Laughton Lorimer's translation of the New Testament from the original Greek was published.  Scots is sometimes used in contemporary fiction, such as the Edinburgh dialect of Scots in Trainspotting by Irvine Welsh (later made into a motion picture of the same name).  But'n'Ben A-Go-Go by Matthew Fitt is a cyberpunk novel written entirely in what Wir Ain Leed[83] (\"Our Own Language\") calls \"General Scots\". Like all cyberpunk work, it contains imaginative neologisms.  The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam has been translated into Scots by Rab Wilson (published in 2004). Alexander Hutchison has translated the poetry of Catullus into Scots, and in the 1980s, Liz Lochhead produced a Scots translation of Tartuffe by Moli\u00e8re. J. K. Annand translated poetry and fiction from German and Medieval Latin into Scots.  The strip cartoons Oor Wullie and The Broons in the Sunday Post use some Scots. In 2018, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stane, a Scots translation of the first Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published by Matthew Fitt.  The vowel system of Modern Scots:[84]  Vowel length is usually conditioned by the Scottish vowel length rule.  The orthography of Early Scots had become more or less standardised[87] by the middle to late sixteenth century.[88] After the Union of the Crowns in 1603, the Standard English of England came to have an increasing influence on the spelling of Scots[89] through the increasing influence and availability of books printed in England. After the Acts of Union in 1707 the emerging Scottish form of Standard English replaced Scots for most formal writing in Scotland.[32]:\u200a11\u200a The eighteenth-century Scots revival saw the introduction of a new literary language descended from the old court Scots, but with an orthography that had abandoned some of the more distinctive old Scots spellings[90] and adopted many standard English spellings. Despite the updated spelling, however, the rhymes make it clear that a Scots pronunciation was intended.[91] These writings also introduced what came to be known as the apologetic apostrophe,[91]:\u200axiv\u200a generally occurring where a consonant exists in the Standard English cognate. This Written Scots drew not only on the vernacular, but also on the King James Bible, and was heavily influenced by the norms and conventions of Augustan English poetry.[13]:\u200a168\u200a Consequently, this written Scots looked very similar to contemporary Standard English, suggesting a somewhat modified version of that, rather than a distinct speech form with a phonological system which had been developing independently for many centuries.[92] This modern literary dialect, \"Scots of the book\" or Standard Scots,[93][94] once again gave Scots an orthography of its own, lacking neither \"authority nor author\".[95] This literary language used throughout Lowland Scotland and Ulster,[96] embodied by writers such as Allan Ramsay, Robert Fergusson, Robert Burns, Sir Walter Scott, Charles Murray, David Herbison, James Orr, James Hogg and William Laidlaw among others, is well described in the 1921 Manual of Modern Scots.[97]  Other authors developed dialect writing, preferring to represent their own speech in a more phonological manner rather than following the pan-dialect conventions of modern literary Scots,[91] especially for the northern[98] and insular dialects of Scots.  During the twentieth century, a number of proposals for spelling reform were presented. Commenting on this, John Corbett (2003: 260) writes that \"devising a normative orthography for Scots has been one of the greatest linguistic hobbies of the past century\". Most proposals entailed regularising the use of established eighteenth- and nineteenth-century conventions, in particular, the avoidance of the apologetic apostrophe, which represented letters that were perceived to be missing when compared to the corresponding English cognates but were never actually present in the Scots word.[99][100] For example, in the fourteenth century, Barbour spelt the Scots cognate of \"taken\" as tane. It is argued that, because there has been no k in the word for over 700 years, representing its omission with an apostrophe is of little value. The current spelling is usually taen.  Through the twentieth century, with the decline of spoken Scots and knowledge of the literary tradition, phonetic (often humorous) representations became more common.[citation needed]  Modern Scots follows the subject\u2013verb\u2013object sentence structure like Standard English. However, the word order Gie's it (Give us it) vs. \"Give it to me\" may be preferred.[13]:\u200a897\u200a The indefinite article a may be used before both consonants and vowels. The definite article the is used before the names of seasons, days of the week, many nouns, diseases, trades and occupations, sciences and academic subjects.[97]:\u200a78\u200a It is also often used in place of the indefinite article and instead of a possessive pronoun.[97]:\u200a77\u200a Scots includes some strong plurals such as ee\/een (\"eye\/eyes\"), cauf\/caur (\"calf\/calves\"), horse\/horse (\"horse\/horses\"), cou\/kye (\"cow\/cows\") and shae\/shuin (\"shoe\/shoes\") that survived from Old English into Modern Scots, but have become weak plurals in Standard Modern English \u2013 ox\/oxen and child\/children being exceptions.[97]:\u200a79\u200a[13]:\u200a896\u200a Nouns of measure and quantity remain unchanged in the plural.[13]:\u200a896\u200a[97]:\u200a80\u200a The relative pronoun is that for all persons and numbers, but may be elided.[13]:\u200a896\u200a[97]:\u200a102\u200a Modern Scots also has a third adjective\/adverb this-that-yon\/yonder (thon\/thonder) indicating something at some distance.[13]:\u200a896\u200a Thir and thae are the plurals of this and that respectively. The present tense of verbs adheres to the Northern subject rule whereby verbs end in -s in all persons and numbers except when a single personal pronoun is next to the verb.[13]:\u200a896\u200a[97]:\u200a112\u200a Certain verbs are often used progressively[13]:\u200a896\u200a and verbs of motion may be dropped before an adverb or adverbial phrase of motion.[13]:\u200a897\u200a Many verbs have strong or irregular forms which are distinctive from Standard English.[13]:\u200a896\u200a[97]:\u200a126\u200a The regular past form of the weak or regular verbs is -it, -t or -ed, according to the preceding consonant or vowel.[13]:\u200a896\u200a[97]:\u200a113\u200a The present participle and gerund in are now usually \/\u0259n\/[101] but may still be differentiated \/\u0259n\/ and \/in\/ in Southern Scots,[102] and \/\u0259n\/ and \/\u026an\/ in Northern Scots. The negative particle is na, sometimes spelled nae, e.g. canna (\"can't\"), daurna (\"daren't\"), michtna (\"mightn't\").[97]:\u200a115\u200a  Adverbs usually take the same form as the verb root or adjective, especially after verbs. Examples include Haein a real guid day (\"Having a really good day\") and She's awfu fauchelt (\"She's awfully tired\").  From The Four Gospels in Braid Scots (William Wye Smith):  Noo the nativitie o' Jesus Christ was this gate: whan his mither Mary was mairry't till Joseph, 'or they cam thegither, she was fund wi' bairn o' the Holie Spirit. Than her guidman, Joseph, bein an upricht man, and no desirin her name sud be i' the mooth o' the public, was ettlin to pit her awa' hidlins. But as he had thir things in his mind, see! an Angel o' the Lord appear't to him by a dream, sayin, \"Joseph, son o' Dauvid, binna feared to tak till ye yere wife, Mary; for that whilk is begotten in her is by the Holie Spirit. \"And she sall bring forth a son, and ye sal ca' his name Jesus; for he sal save his folk frae their sins.\" Noo, a' this was dune, that it micht come to pass what was said by the Lord throwe the prophet, \"Tak tent! a maiden sal be wi' bairn, and sal bring forth a son; and they wull ca' his name Emmanuel,\" whilk is translatit, \"God wi' us.\" Sae Joseph, comin oot o' his sleep, did as the Angel had bidden him, and took till him his wife. And leev'd in continence wi' her till she had brocht forth her firstborn son; and ca'd his name Jesus.  From The New Testament in Scots (William Laughton Lorimer, 1885\u20131967)  This is the storie o the birth o Jesus Christ. His mither Mary wis trystit til Joseph, but afore they war mairriet she wis fund tae be wi bairn bi the Halie Sp\u00edrit. Her husband Joseph, honest man, hed nae mind tae affront her afore the warld an wis for brakkin aff their tryst hidlinweys; an sae he wis een ettlin tae dae, whan an angel o the Lord kythed til him in a draim an said til him, \"Joseph, son o Dauvit, be nane feared tae tak Mary your trystit wife intil your hame; the bairn she is cairrein is o the Halie Sp\u00edrit. She will beir a son, an the name ye ar tae g\u00ede him is Jesus, for he will sauf his fowk frae their sins.\" Aa this happent at the wurd spokken bi the Lord throu the Prophet micht be fulfilled: Behaud, the virgin wil bouk an beir a son, an they will caa his name Immanuel \u2013 that is, \"God wi us\". Whan he hed waukit frae his sleep, Joseph did as the angel hed bidden him, an tuik his trystit wife hame wi him. But he bedditna wi her or she buir a son; an he caa'd the bairn Jesus."},{"title":"Cymru","content":"  Cymru ([\u02c8k\u0259m.r\u0268] \u24d8; KUM-ri or COME-ree)[1] is the Welsh language name for Wales, a country of the United Kingdom, on the island of Great Britain.  The modern Welsh name Cymru is the Welsh name for Wales, while the name for the Welsh people is Cymry. These words (both of which are pronounced [\u02c8k\u0259m.r\u0268]) are descended from the Brythonic word combrogi, meaning \"fellow-countrymen\" or a \"compatriot\".[2][3] The use of the word Cymry as a self-designation derives from the location in the post-Roman Era (after the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons) of the Welsh (Brythonic-speaking) people in modern Wales as well as in northern England and southern Scotland (Yr Hen Ogledd) (English: The Old North). It emphasised that the Welsh in modern Wales and in the Hen Ogledd were one people, different from other peoples.[4] In particular, the term was not applied to the Cornish or the Breton peoples, who are of similar heritage, culture, and language to the Welsh. The word came into use as a self-description probably before the 7th century.[5] It is attested in a praise poem to Cadwallon ap Cadfan (Moliant Cadwallon, by Afan Ferddig) c.\u2009633.[6][7] In Welsh literature, the word Cymry was used throughout the Middle Ages to describe the Welsh, though the older, more generic term Brythoniaid continued to be used to describe any of the Britonnic peoples (including the Welsh) and was the more common literary term until c.\u20091200. Thereafter Cymry prevailed as a reference to the Welsh. Until c.\u20091560 the word was spelt Kymry or Cymry, regardless of whether it referred to the people or their homeland,[2] including as Kymry, in the Armes Prydein, in the 10th century.[8]  \"Wales\" on the other hand, is derived from an Anglo-Saxon word meaning \"foreigner\", specifically those who were under Roman rule (specifically a \"Romanised foreigner\").[3][9] Cambria is a medieval Latin name also historically used to refer to Wales, and is a latinisation of Cymru.[10]  In recent history, in particular following Welsh devolution, calls to rename places in Wales to their Welsh names, and prohibiting use of their English names, have been increasing. Including calls for renames into English to be stopped,[11] or for all non-Welsh names to be removed,[12] receiving criticism from London-based Daily Mail and UK Government.[13] The controversial origin of the meaning of \"Wales\", which derives from a term meaning \"foreigner\", and that it is an \"imposed\" non-Welsh name, is used as a reason to stop the use of \"Wales\",[14] or at least prefer Cymru.[15]  Proponents for the change compare it to other countries which changed their name, such as Ceylon to Sri Lanka, Persia to Iran, and in 2022, Turkey to T\u00fcrkiye.[16]  In 2019, during discussions on renaming the then National Assembly for Wales. Senedd Cymru was considered as the body's sole potential name, however, it was rejected by Assembly Members in November 2019.[17] Simply \"Senedd\" was also proposed,[18] but rejected by the first minister Carwyn Jones, fearing it would be not understood.[19][20] The parliament instead chose two names Senedd Cymru and the \"Welsh Parliament\", with \"Senedd\" being a short name used in both English and Welsh.[19] Although the legal preferred name, used in all post-2020 legislation, is just Senedd Cymru in both languages.[21]  In 2022, the Football Association of Wales, considered changing references to the national football team (including women's)[22] to use Cymru rather than \"Wales\". The association already uses the name Cymru in their internal and external communications, and by all their staff.[23][24][25] The consideration was compared to the team's overall shift to become more Welsh nationalist and pro-independence.[26] The association has been increasing its use of Cymru and Welsh words in general since UEFA Euro 2016.[27]  In 2024, a petition called for the prohibition of the name \"Wales\", for the Welsh name Cymru to be the only name. The petition gained 5,400 signatures by 4 January 2024,[28][14] and over 10,000 by 15 January, meeting the threshold for a Senedd debate.[29][30] A counter-petition was launched after.[31]  The petition follows other removals of English names in Wales in 2023, such as the removal of the English names \"Snowdonia\" and \"Snowdon\" for Eryri and Yr Wyddfa, their Welsh names respectively, and removing \"Brecon Beacons\" for Bannau Brycheiniog.[32]  While Cymru is also used by pro-independence organisations such as YesCymru and AUOBCymru, it is also used by various non-political charities and organisations. "},{"title":"Assistant referee (association football)","content":"  In association football, an assistant referee (previously known as a linesman) is an official who assists the referee in administering the Laws of the Game during a match. Although assistants are not required under the Laws, at most organised levels of football the match officiating crew consists of the referee and at least two assistant referees. The responsibilities of the various assistant referees are listed in Law 6, \"The Other Match Officials\". In the current Laws the term \"assistant referee\" technically refers only to the two officials who generally patrol the touchlines, with the wider range of assistants to the referee given other titles.  The assistant referees' duties generally consist of judging when the ball has left the field of play \u2013 including which team is entitled to return the ball to play, judging when an offside offence has occurred, and advising the referee when an infringement of the Laws has occurred out of his or her view. These two officials are typically positioned on opposite touchlines, and each stay beside different halves of the pitch.  At higher levels of play the referee is also assisted by a fourth official. The fourth official's duties are usually administrative in nature, such as supervising the substitution procedures. The fourth official will generally spend the game in the vicinity of the teams' technical areas.  Competition rules will mandate procedures for replacing officials who are unable to continue. Often, the fourth official will replace the referee or one of the assistant referees if they are unable to continue. The Laws also allow for designated reserve assistant referees who have no other responsibilities unless called upon to replace a member of the officiating team who is unable to continue.[1]  At very high-level games there may be further assistant referees. Additional assistant referees are positioned to observe incidents near the two goals. Video assistant referees view footage of the game and can advise the referee to review decisions that may have been incorrect.[1]  The referee is the sole arbiter of the Laws during the match. Assistants' calls and judgements are considered to be advisory and can be overruled by the referee.[1]  As outlined in Law 6 of the Laws of the Game, the officiating team works together to enforce the Laws during a game, though the referee remains the final decision maker in all matters. The assistant referees (including additional assistant referees if present) and the fourth official are expected to advise the referee if they have a clearer view of any particular incident.[1] At the highest levels of play, particularly in matches held in large stadiums, the entire officiating crew may be equipped with wireless microphones and earpieces to facilitate vocal communication across long distances or through loud stadium noise.  A team of assistants allows for the replacement of officials if one or more are unable to continue. The system of who replaces who is a matter for the organising competition.[1]  All officials wear uniforms that match that of the referee, though the fourth official will often wear a tracksuit over the kit in colder weather.  Law 6 of the Laws of the Game specifies that \"two assistant referees may be appointed\".[1] The assistant referees move along the touchlines, each covering their own half of the field of play.  In general, assistant referees are responsible for assisting the referee with:  All decisions by the assistant referees are only advisory to the referee; their decisions are not binding and the referee is allowed to overrule an assistant. An assistant referee may also be called upon by the referee to provide an opinion regarding matters which the referee requires clarification on. Occasionally the assistant referee will assist in player management during free kicks, as well as provide visual assistance during penalty kicks. The assistant referees also usually assist the referee with preparatory and administrative functions.  Assistant referees carry brightly coloured flags (usually red, yellow, or some pattern involving those colours) which are used to indicate their decisions to the referee, players, and spectators. During the game each assistant referee oversees one touch-line and one end of the field utilising the diagonal system of control. The more senior of the two assistants will normally occupy the side of the field containing the technical areas, to help oversee substitutions. At higher levels of play, the assistant referees' flags may be equipped with buttons that the assistant referee may press to send an audible signal to the referee in order to get the referee's attention.  Assistant referees were formerly called linesmen. In 1996, the name was changed, primarily to better reflect the modern role of these officials, and secondarily to become non-gender specific, though the term is still in widespread unofficial use. They are also sometimes incorrectly referred to as \"referee's assistants\".  The fourth official assists the referee in a variety of tasks, and may be called upon to replace another match official. The practice of having a named replacement referee was introduced in 1966 by English referee and administrator Ken Aston, but the International Football Association Board (IFAB) did not officially create the position until 1991, and listed only areas of responsibility. The fourth official is simply instructed to assist the referee at all times, and their duties are largely at the discretion of the referee.  The fourth official typically has a short distance from the touchline between the two teams' technical areas, however their positioning is not defined by the Laws of the Game.  In general, fourth officials are responsible for assisting the referee with:  In practice, the fourth official becomes a key member of the officiating team, who can watch the field and players and advise the referee on situations that are going on out of their sight. The fourth official keeps an extra set of records, and helps make sure the referee does not make a serious error such as cautioning the wrong player, or giving two cautions to the same player and forgetting to send off the player.[2]  Where the fourth official is a junior member of the officiating team, they are generally expected to replace an assistant referee where they are unable to continue to perform their duties (either due to injury or replacing the main referee). However, in most high-level competitions, the fourth official is a designated referee (as opposed to assistant) and therefore replaces the referee in cases where they are unable to continue.  The additional assistant referee (AAR) is an official that assists the referee behind the goal line to assist the referee in observing any incident that may occur near the penalty area. Recent trials, for example at the 2009\u201310 UEFA Europa League group stage, have been started to make place for an additional two assistant referees to be added to the game, positioned behind the goal lines, to \"ensure that the Laws of the Game are upheld, informing the referee of incidents of any kind that they may otherwise have missed, particularly in key areas of the field like the penalty area and its surroundings,\" but only informing the referee of their observations through a wireless communication system. Their positioning also gives a good view to assist the referee in \"ghost goal\"-type incidents. The trial was evaluated by International Football Association Board (IFAB) technical experts.[3]  This trial was later extended to the 2011\u201312 UEFA Champions League and qualifying games and the final tournament for the UEFA Euro 2012. Their reception has been mixed.[4] Following a two-year experiment in the UEFA Champions League, Europa League and Euro 2012, as well as the AFC President's Cup and competitions in Brazil, France, Italy, Morocco and Qatar, the use of additional assistant referees was approved by the IFAB in July 2012.[5] Additional assistant referees were used in the 2013 Scottish Cup Final, the first time they had been utilised in a domestic match in Scottish football.[6]  The video assistant referee (VAR) is an official, who will also have assistants themselves, that reviews decisions made with the use of video footage and a headset for communication with the on-field referee. Their use by competitions is optional.  The fifth official was an official meant to serve as a replacement for either of the assistant referees in the unlikely event of an injury or incident that would prevent the assistant from continuing the game. For matches in the 2006 World Cup, FIFA assigned five officials. The role of the fifth official was to assist the fourth official in a variety of tasks, and potentially be called upon to replace another match official if necessary, for example in the case of injury.[7] If an assistant referee could not carry on their duties, the fifth official was to be the primary replacement, whereas the fourth official was the referee's primary replacement.[citation needed] This distinction was made to reflect the fact that assistant referees and referees perform different tasks.[citation needed]  The fifth official had access to television coverage of the match, but was not permitted to advise the on-field referees of any incidents they had missed.[8] Speaking after the 2006 FIFA World Cup Final, Italy coach Marcello Lippi claimed that the referee had sent off France player Zinedine Zidane after receiving advice from \"the fourth and fifth officials looking at the video at the edge of the pitch\".[9] These claims were subsequently denied by FIFA.[8]  In the current Laws of the Game the role of the fifth official has been reduced to that of the reserve assistant referee (RAR, also known as the reserve official). They have no duties other than to replace an assistant referee or fourth official who is unable to continue.[1] From July 2023 the RAR will be able to replace an additional assistant referee and assist the referee as per other match officials.[10] "},{"title":"Rugby School","content":"  Rugby School is a public school (English fee-charging boarding school for pupils aged 13\u201318) in Rugby, Warwickshire, England.[1]  Founded in 1567 as a free grammar school for local boys, it is one of the oldest independent schools in Britain.[2] Up to 1667, the school remained in comparative obscurity. Its re-establishment by Thomas Arnold during his time as Headmaster, from 1828 to 1841, was seen as the forerunner of the Victorian public school.[3] It was one of nine prestigious schools investigated by the Clarendon Commission of 1864 and later regulated as one of the seven schools included in the Public Schools Act 1868. Originally a boys school, it became fully co-educational in 1992.[4]  The school's alumni \u2013 or \"Old Rugbeians\" \u2013 include a UK prime minister, several bishops, prominent poets, scientists, writers and soldiers.  Rugby School is the birthplace of rugby football.[5]  Rugby School was founded in 1567 as a provision in the will of Lawrence Sheriff, who had made his fortune supplying groceries to Queen Elizabeth I of England.[6] In the last few months of his life, Sheriff had drawn up a will which stipulated that his fortune should be used to found almshouses and a free grammar school \"to serve chiefly for the children of Rugby and Brownsover... and next for such as be of other places hereunto adjoyneing.\". Shortly before his death, Sheriff added a codicil to his will reducing the amount of money he left to the school, possibly due to a family financial problem, but instead leaving his eight acre Conduit Close estate in Middlesex: At the time this seemed like a poor exchange, as the estate consisted of undeveloped farmland on the edge of London, however, in time this endowment made Rugby School a wealthy institution due to the subsequent development of the area and rise in land values. The area of what is now the Rugby Estate includes much of what is now Great Ormond Street, Lamb's Conduit Street and Rugby Street in the London district of Bloomsbury.[7]  Up to 1667, the school remained in comparative obscurity. Sheriff's endowment was not fully realized for some time, due to a challenge over the provisions of the will from the Howkins family, to whom Sheriff was related through his sister, Bridget. Its history during that trying period is characterised mainly by a series of lawsuits between the Howkins family, who tried to defeat the intentions of the testator, and the masters and trustees, who tried to carry them out. A final decision was handed down in 1667, confirming the findings of a commission in favour of the trust, and henceforth the school maintained a steady growth.[8] Under the headmastership of Henry Holyoake (from 1688 to 1731) the school became more than simply a local concern, and began to take on national importance.[8] By the end of the 17th century, there were pupils from every part of England attending the school.[9]  The school was originally based in a wooden schoolhouse on Church Street opposite St Andrew's Church, which incorporated Lawrence Sheriff's former house. By the 1740s this building was in poor condition, and the school looked to relocate to new premises. In 1750, the school moved to its current location to the south of the town centre, when it purchased a former Manor House at the south of High Street; this became the Master's house, a new schoolhouse was built alongside. The current school buildings date from the 19th and early 20th centuries.[10]  Henry Ingles, who was Headmaster between 1794 and 1806, was known for his strict discipline and gained the nickname \"The Black Tiger\". His time as Headmaster is most notable for the 'Great Rebellion' of 1797: It started when Ingles heard one of the boys shoot a cork gun, and the boy told him that Mr Rowell, a grocer, had supplied the gunpowder. Mr Rowell denied this, and as a result the boy Astley was flogged by Ingles, the boys retaliated by smashing Mr Rowell's windows and Ingles insisted that the boys pay for the damage. This provoked a full-scale riot, in which the boys blew off doors, smashed windows and burned furniture and books. As the other Masters were away, Ingles called on help from the townsfolk. A party of recruiting soldiers and some townsfolk advanced on the rioters, who retreated onto a moated island in the school grounds. The Riot Act was read out by a local justice of the peace, calling on the boys to surrender, and while this caused a distraction a group of soldiers waded across the moat from the rear and took the boys prisoner.[10]  Rugby School's most famous headmaster was Thomas Arnold, from 1828 to 1841, whose emphasis on moral and religious principle, was widely admired and was seen as the blueprint for Victorian public schools. Arnold's period as headmaster is immortalised in Thomas Hughes 1857 novel Tom Brown's School Days. In the Victorian period, Rugby School saw several further Headmasters of some distinction, these included Frederick Temple (1858\u20131869) who would later become the Archbishop of Canterbury, John Percival (1887\u20131895) after whom the Percival Guildhouse is named, and Herbert Armitage James (1895\u20131910)[10]  In 1845, a committee of Rugby schoolboys, William Delafield Arnold, W. W. Shirley and Frederick Hutchins,[11] wrote the \"Laws of Football as Played At Rugby School\", the first published set of laws for any code of football.[11][12]  Rugby was one of the nine prestigious schools investigated by the Clarendon Commission of 1861\u201364 (the schools under scrutiny being Eton, Charterhouse, Harrow, Shrewsbury, Westminster, and Winchester, and two day schools: St Paul's and Merchant Taylors). Rugby went on to be included in the Public Schools Act 1868, which ultimately related only to the seven boarding schools.  From the early days of the school the pupils were divided into \"Foundationers\" i.e. boys who lived in Rugby and surrounding villages who received free schooling, as per Sheriff's original bequest, and \"Non-Foundationers\", boys from outside the Rugby area who paid fees and were boarders. Non-Foundationers were admitted from the early history of the school as they helped to pay the bills. Gradually, as the school's reputation grew, fee-paying Non-Foundationers became dominant and local boys benefited less and less from Sheriff's original intentions. By the latter half of the 19th century it was no longer desirable to have local boys attending a prestigious public school and so a new school \u2013 Lawrence Sheriff Grammar School \u2013 was founded in 1878 in order to continue Sheriff's original bequest for a free school for local boys.[10]  On several occasions in the late 19th century Rugby School was visited by the French educator Pierre de Coubertin, who would later cite the school as one of the main inspirations for his most notable achievement, the founding of the modern Olympic Games in 1896.[13][14]  In 1975 two girls were admitted to the sixth form and the first girls' house opened three years later, followed by three more. In 1992 the school became fully co-educational when the first 13-year-old girls arrived, and in 1995 Rugby had its first-ever Head Girl, Louise Woolcock, who appeared on the front page of The Times. In September 2003 the last girls' house was added. Today, total enrolment of day pupils, from forms 4 to 12, numbers around 800.[15]  The game of Rugby football owes its name to the school.  The legend of William Webb Ellis and the origin of the game is commemorated by a plaque. The story is that Webb Ellis was the first to pick up a football and run with it, and thus invent a new sport. However, the sole source of the story is Matthew Bloxam, a former pupil but not a contemporary of Webb Ellis. In October 1876, four years after the death of Webb Ellis, in a letter to the school newspaper The Meteor he quotes an unknown friend relating the story to him. He elaborated on the story four years later in another letter to The Meteor, but shed no further light on its source. Richard Lindon, a boot and shoemaker who had premises across the street from the school's main entrance in Lawrence Sheriff Street, is credited with the invention of the \"oval\" rugby ball, the rubber inflatable bladder and the brass hand pump.[16]  There were no standard rules for football in Webb Ellis's time at Rugby (1816\u20131825) and most varieties involved carrying the ball. The games played at Rugby were organised by the pupils and not the masters, the rules being a matter of custom and not written down. They were frequently changed and modified with each new intake of students.  Rugby fives is a handball game, similar to squash, played in an enclosed court. It has similarities with Winchester fives (a form of Wessex fives) and Eton fives.  It is most commonly believed to be derived from Wessex fives, a game played by Thomas Arnold, Headmaster of Rugby, who had played Wessex fives when a boy at Lord Weymouth's Grammar, now Warminster School. The open court of Wessex fives, built in 1787, is still in existence at Warminster School although it has fallen out of regular use.  Rugby fives is played between two players (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles), the aim being to hit the ball above a 'bar' across the front wall in such a way that the opposition cannot return it before a second bounce. The ball is slightly larger than a golf ball, leather-coated and hard. Players wear leather padded gloves on both hands, with which they hit the ball.  Rugby fives continues to have a good following with tournaments being run nationwide, presided over by the Rugby Fives Association.[17]  The school has produced a number of cricketers who have gone onto play Test and first-class cricket. The school has played host to two major matches, the first of which was a Twenty20 match between Warwickshire and Glamorgan in the 2013 Friends Life t20.[18] The second match was a List-A one-day match between Warwickshire and Sussex in the 2015 Royal London One-Day Cup, though it was due to host a match in the 2014 competition, however this was abandoned.[19] In the 2015 match, William Porterfield scored a century, with a score of exactly 100.[20] Warwickshire will return to Rugby School in 2024 to play three matches in the One-Day Cup.[21]  Rugby School has both day and boarding-pupils, the latter in the majority. Originally it was for boys only, but girls have been admitted to the sixth form since 1975. It went fully co-educational in 1992. The school community is divided into houses.  Pupils beginning Rugby in the F Block (first year) study various subjects.[37] In a pupil's second year (E block), they do nine subjects which are for their GCSEs, this is the same for the D Block (GCSE year).[38] The school then provides standard A-levels in 29 subjects. Students at this stage have the choice of taking three or four subjects and are also offered the opportunity to take an extended project. The School also offers taking the IB Diploma Programme.[39] Oxbridge acceptance percentage in 2007 was\u00a010.4% [40] In 2023, 68% of students that took A-levels at Rugby School scored A*\/A while 83% of GCSE students scored 9\/7.[41]  The Governing Body provides financial benefits with school fees to families unable to afford them. Parents of pupils who are given a Scholarship are capable of obtaining a 10% fee deduction, although more than one scholarship can be awarded to one student.  There have been a number of notable Old Rugbeians, including the purported father of the sport of Rugby William Webb Ellis, the inventor of Australian rules football, Tom Wills, the war poets Rupert Brooke and John Gillespie Magee, Jr., Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, author and mathematician Lewis Carroll, poet and cultural critic Matthew Arnold, the author and social critic Salman Rushdie (who said of his time there: \"Almost the only thing I am proud of about going to Rugby school was that Lewis Carroll went there too.\"[43]) and the Irish writer and republican Francis Stuart. The Indian concert pianist, music composer and singer Adnan Sami also studied at Rugby School.[44] Matthew Arnold's father Thomas Arnold, was a headmaster of the school. Philip Henry Bahr (later Sir Philip Henry Manson-Bahr), a zoologist and medical doctor, World War I veteran, was President of both Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene and Medical Society of London, and vice-president of the British Ornithologists' Union.[45][46] Richard Barrett Talbot Kelly joined the army in 1915, straight after leaving the school, earned a Military Cross during the First World War, and later returned to the school as Director of Art.[47]  The Rugbeian Society is for former pupils at the school.[48] An Old Rugbeian is sometimes referred to as an OR.  The purposes of the society are to encourage and help Rugbeians in interacting with each other and to strengthen the ties between ORs and the school.  In 2010 the Rugbeians reached the semi-finals of the Public Schools' Old Boys' Sevens tournament, hosted by the Old Silhillians to celebrate the 450th anniversary of fellow Warwickshire public school, Solihull School.  The buildings of Rugby School date from the 18th and 19th century with some early 20th-century additions. The oldest buildings are the Old Quad Buildings and the School House the oldest parts of which date from 1748, but were mostly built between 1809 and 1813, designed by Henry Hakewill, these are grade II* listed.[49][50]  Most of the current landmark buildings date from the Victorian era and were designed by William Butterfield: The most notable of these is the chapel, dating from 1872, which is topped by an  octagonal tower 138 feet (42\u00a0m) tall, and is grade I listed.[51][52] Butterfield's New Quad buildings are Grade II* listed and date from 1867 to 1885. The Grade II* War Memorial chapel, designed by Sir Charles Nicholson, dates to 1922.[53][54] Nicholson was educated at the school from the late-1870s.[55]  The Temple Speech Room on Barby Road was named after former Rugby headmaster, Frederick Temple,[56] It was opened on 3 July 1909 by King Edward VII.[57] Designed by Thomas Graham Jackson, it is grade II listed.[58] The Macready Theatre is based in a prominent Victorian building on Lawrence Sheriff Street which was built as classrooms in 1885, in 1975 it was converted into a theatre, in 2018, it was opened to the general public.[59]  Rugby's most famous headmaster was Thomas Arnold, appointed in 1828; he executed many reforms to the school curriculum and administration. Arnold's and the school's reputations were immortalised through Thomas Hughes' book Tom Brown's School Days.  David Newsome writes about the new educational methods employed by Arnold in his book, 'Godliness and Good Learning' (Cassell 1961). He calls the morality practised at Arnold's school muscular Christianity. Arnold had three principles: religious and moral principle, gentlemanly conduct and academic performance. George Mosse, former professor of history at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, lectured on Arnold's time at Rugby. According to Mosse, Thomas Arnold created an institution which fused religious and moral principles, gentlemanly conduct, and learning based on self-discipline. These morals were socially enforced through the \"Gospel of work\". The object of education was to produce \"the Christian gentleman,\" a man with good outward appearance, playful but earnest, industrious, manly, honest, virginal pure, innocent, and responsible.  In 1888 the appointment of Marie Bethell Beauclerc by Percival was the first appointment of a female teacher in an English boys' public school and the first time shorthand had been taught in any such school. The shorthand course was popular with one hundred boys in the classes.  In September 2005, the school was one of fifty independent schools operating independent school fee-fixing, in breach of the Competition Act, 1998. All of the schools involved were ordered to abandon this practice, pay a nominal penalty of \u00a310,000 each and to make ex-gratia payments totalling three million pounds into a trust designed to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in respect of which fee information had been shared.[65][66]  However, the head of the Independent Schools Council declared that independent schools had always been exempt from anti-cartel rules applied to business, were following a long-established procedure in sharing the information with each other and that they were unaware of the change to the law (on which they had not been consulted). She wrote to John Vickers, the OFT director-general, stating \"They are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer. They are schools that have quite openly continued to follow a long-established practice because they were unaware that the law had changed.\"[67] "},{"title":"Team sport","content":"  A team sport is a type of sport where the fundamental nature of the game or sport necessitates the participation of multiple individuals working together as a team, and it is inherently impossible or highly impractical to execute the sport as a single-player endeavour. In team sports, the cooperative effort of team members is essential for the sport to function and achieve its objectives. The objective often involves teammates facilitating the movement of a ball or similar object in accordance with a set of rules, in order to score points. Examples are basketball, volleyball, rugby, water polo, handball, lacrosse, cricket, baseball, and the various forms of football, and hockey.  These sports emphasize teamwork, strategy, and coordination among team members, while competing against opposing teams, to achieve a common goal.[2] Team sports do not include individual or individual-to-team events within a sport.[3]  The meaning of a \"team sport\" has been disputed in recent years. Some types of sports have different objectives or rules than \"traditional\" team sports. These types of team sports do not involve teammates facilitating the movement of a ball or similar object in accordance with a set of rules, in order to score points. Overall, the division into team sports and individual sports is not always unproblematic, since there are different combinations in the individual sports.  This includes sports that can only be practiced as a team sport. The number of team members is fixed for the team. In order to compete successfully in championships and tournaments, teams need a roster that is significantly larger than the number of players starting the game. Players may be substituted from a squad in competition matches to replace exhausted or injured players or to make tactical changes. Examples are basketball, volleyball, rugby, water polo, handball, lacrosse, cricket, baseball, and the various forms of football, and hockey.  Teams of two people are sports, such as dancesport or beach volleyball. No substitute players are used here. The two partners are absolutely dependent on each other. The absence of a person here means the loss of competitiveness.[4][5][6]  In addition, there are sports, while mostly played singles, that are also played in different formations together cooperatively, such as badminton, table tennis or tennis in doubles, although this formation is significantly lower in terms of prestige, spectators and prize money.[7] In these formations, common tactics, teamwork and agreements are crucial for success. There are also different rowing formations such as one, two, four and eight or sailing with their different boat classes.[8][9] The most important thing here is smooth movements and common tactics. This also applies approximately to the team time trial in cycling,[10][11] while it is the case with cycling tours and one-day races are different tasks for the team members of a cycling team.[12][13]  In some sports, relay races are held, which can be distinguished from pure team evaluations by a common racing tactic and the observance of change regulations. Relay races are common in running, swimming, cross-country skiing, biathlon or short-track speed skating and are also an integral part in the Olympic Games program[14] with high popularity. [15][16]  There are team ratings in many sports, in which the results of individual athletes or formations are added up. In cycling team members, whilst still in competition with each other, will also work towards assisting one member of the team, usually a specialist, to the highest possible finishing position.[13][12][17]  In some sports where participants are entered by a team, they do not only compete against members of other teams, but also against each other for points towards championship standings, for example in motorsport, particularly Formula One.[18] Team orders can occur in such teams and although previously accepted was banned in Formula One[19] between 2002 and 2010. After a controversy involving team orders at the 2010 German Grand Prix however, the regulation was removed as of the 2011 season.[20]  In summary, team sports are characterized by the impossibility or impracticality of executing the sport as a single-player endeavor, and the entire game or match relies on team dynamics. In contrast, sports with team ratings and formations involve both individual and team aspects, where individual performances contribute to a team's overall success but may not be entirely reliant on team dynamics. Relay races combine individual efforts within a team context, where smooth transitions are essential.  Areas around the Mediterranean had a long tradition of athletic events. Ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians depicted athletic scenes in tombs of kings and their nobles. They did not, however, hold regular competitions, and those events that occurred were probably the preserve of kings and upper classes. Minoans culture held gymnastics in high esteem, with bull-leaping, tumbling, running, wrestling and boxing shown on their frescoes. The Mycenaeans adopted Minoan games and also raced chariots in religious or funerary ceremonies.[21][22] Homer's heroes participate in athletic competitions to honor the dead. In the Iliad there are chariot races, boxing, wrestling, a foot race, as well as fencing, archery, and spear throwing. The Odyssey adds to these a long jump and discus throw.[23]  It was in Greece that sports were first instituted formally, with the first Olympic Games recorded in 776 BCE in Olympia, where they were celebrated until 393 CE.[24] These ancient Olympic Games consisted of running, long jump, boxing, wrestling, Pankration (combat sport),  discus throw, and javelin throw.[25] In the Bayankhongor Province of Mongolia, Neolithic-era cave paintings dating to 7000 BC depict a wrestling match surrounded by crowds.[26] Prehistoric cave-paintings in Japan show a sport similar to sumo wrestling.[27] In Wadi Sura, near Gilf Kebir in Libya, a Neolithic rock painting in the cave of swimmers shows evidence of swimming and archery being practiced around 6000 BC.[28]  Team sports have a rich and ancient history dating back thousands of years. These activities served as important facets of society, not only for physical fitness but also for social, cultural, and even political purposes. In ancient civilizations, team sports were prevalent and often intertwined with religious and cultural practices. In Mesoamerica, the Aztec ball game, ollamaliztli, was not just a sport but also a ritual with symbolic significance.[29]  The Greeks, who laid the foundations for many contemporary sports, held various team sports as central to their culture. The Olympic Games, first recorded in 776 BCE, featured events like chariot racing and team foot races, fostering unity and friendly competition among city-states.[30] The Spartans, known for their military prowess, engaged in team sports like the episkyros, a type of football.[31]  Rome adopted and adapted many Greek sports, introducing harpastum, a ball game similar to soccer, and ludi circenses, which included team chariot racing. These sports provided a sense of entertainment and unity, while also serving as a means of social control.[32]  In ancient China, cuju was a popular team sport akin to modern soccer, played as early as the Han dynasty (206 BCE \u2013 220 CE). The sport was not only a form of entertainment but also a means of fostering camaraderie among communities.[33]  Throughout history, team sports have reflected the values and priorities of their respective cultures. Whether it was the competitive spirit of the Greeks, the discipline of the Romans, or the communal bonding in China, ancient team sports played an integral role in the social fabric of civilizations. They transcended mere physical activity, serving as a testament to the enduring significance of sports in human history. Today, these ancient traditions continue to influence modern team sports, reminding us of the timeless appeal and cultural importance of collective athletic endeavors.  status after the 2022 Winter Olympics  Summer Olympics (14)  Notes   Winter Olympics (2)  Ice hockey and curling are team sports at the Winter Olympics, with particularity that the men's tournament in Ice hockey was introduced at the 1920 Summer Olympics and was transferred permanently to the Winter Olympic Games program in 1924, in France. Before the monobob event has been introduced as an additional women's class by the IBSF for the 2020\u201321 world cup season and the 2022 Olympic games, bobsleigh was considered as a pure team sport, that can only be practiced as a team with at least two drivers. At the present time the men's events consist of the two-man and four-man class and the women's events are restricted only to the two-woman and women's monobob class.[35]  Bibliography "},{"title":"Replay (sports)","content":"A replay (also called a rematch) is the repetition of a match in many sports.  In association football, replays were often used to decide the winner in a knock-out tournament when the previous match ended in a draw, especially in finals.  In 1970, FIFA (the worldwide governing body of the sport) and IFAB (the international rules committee for the sport) allowed penalty shoot-outs to be held if a match ended in a draw after extra time.  The penalty shootout made its appearance immediately thereafter.  The first instance of a shootout replacing a replay (rather than lots) was the final of the 1976 European championship.  The shootout's first use at the World Cup took place in the 1982 semi-finals. Replays are now only used in the early rounds of the English FA Cup tournament, as well as rounds up until the semi-finals in the Scottish Cup. Games going to replays in the FA Cup since 1991 are only replayed once, with extra time and penalty shootouts used to decide the tie if the replay ends in a draw. Historically, FA Cup games would be replayed as many times as necessary until one team managed to win - in 1971, a fourth qualifying round match between Alvechurch and Oxford City was replayed five times after the initial match ended 2-2, with Alvechurch winning 1-0 in the fifth replay to settle the tie.[1] On 18 April 2024, The Football Association announced that would scrap replays altogether from the first round of the competition proper of the FA Cup beginning from the 2024-25 edition to help ease fixture congestion for clubs competing in UEFA competitons and ease fixture congestion though replays will be retained during the qualifying phase of competition involving non-League clubs.[2]  Replays can sometimes also take place on occasion if a team has fielded an ineligible player in the original match,[3] or if a player has been injured as a result of an action by a spectator (such as throwing a coin or a bottle).[4] However, more common consequences for such actions include awarding victory to non-offending teams and\/or deducting points from offending teams.  Until 2007, in the rare event that a Major League Baseball game ended in a tie, it was replayed if necessary to decide postseason advancement. Tied games counted in statistical records, but were not counted in a team's win-loss percentage. Since 2007, tied games that must be abandoned for whatever reason are resumed (if feasible and\/or necessary) from the point of suspension, as opposed to being replayed in full.   Until the 2020 Major League Baseball season, it was possible for teams to protest games, usually if the manager believed his team was negatively impacted by a consequential umpiring decision that violated MLB rules. If the protest was upheld, the game would be replayed from the \"point-of-protest\" at a later date. In total, 15 MLB games were partially replayed under this rule, the last such occurrence happening in 2014. Most upheld protests were in the National League. The only case where the American League upheld a protest and ordered a replay was after the famous Pine Tar Incident in 1983. The rule was abolished after the 2019 MLB season, so protests and ensuing replays are no longer possible.  In boxing, rematches (referred to as \"rematch\" and not \"replay\", or simply by the match-up followed by a Roman numeral, as in Holyfield vs. Tyson II) are common and expected, producing historically significant moments in the sport. Examples include:  Replays are often used as tiebreakers in the Gaelic games of hurling, Gaelic football, camogie and ladies' Gaelic football.[5][6] Extra time, penalty shoot-outs and free-taking shootouts have, in recent years, been increasingly used as tiebreakers to prevent fixture congestion.[7][8][9]  The National Football League has a clause in its rules that allows the commissioner to order a whole or partial replay of a game that has been corrupted by an \"extraordinary act.\" For a partial replay, the game is reset to the point immediately before the play in which the act took place, with all game parameters (time, score, ball position and possession) set to where they were at that point. A full replay discards the result of the previous game altogether and restarts the game from its beginning.  As of 2024, the NFL has never used its extraordinary act clause. The rulebook states that the authority is only to be used in the event that \"any club action, non-participant interference, or calamity occurs in an NFL game which the Commissioner deems so extraordinarily unfair or outside the accepted tactics encountered in professional football that such action has a major effect on the result of the game.\"[10] Former commissioner Pete Rozelle refused on principle to use the provisions, notably after the notorious Snowplow Game.[11] Under commissioner Roger Goodell, the league also opposes using the power, mainly because of the domino effect it could have on the rest of the schedule and the financial ramifications that would result.[12] When this situation occurred in the aftermath of Damar Hamlin's on-field collapse in January 2023, it was decided instead to create an alternate playoff path for both the Buffalo Bills and Cincinnati Bengals, rather than replay the game. "},{"title":"Gaelic games","content":"  Gaelic games (Irish: Cluich\u00ed Gaelacha) are a set of sports played worldwide, though they are particularly popular in Ireland, where they originated. They include Gaelic football, hurling, Gaelic handball and rounders. Football and hurling, the most popular of the sports, are both organised by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). Women's versions of hurling and football are also played: camogie, organised by the Camogie Association of Ireland, and ladies' Gaelic football, organised by the Ladies' Gaelic Football Association. While women's versions are not organised by the GAA (with the exception of handball, where men's and women's handball competitions are both organised by the GAA Handball organisation), they are closely associated with it but are still separate organisations.[1]  Gaelic games clubs exist all over the world.[2][3][4] They are Ireland's most popular sports, ahead of rugby union and association football.[5] Almost a million people (977,723) attended 45 GAA senior championships games in 2017 (up 29% in hurling and 22% in football on 2016 figures) combined with attendances at other championship and league games generating gate receipts of \u20ac34,391,635.[6]  Gaelic games are designated within the primary school curriculum as requiring \"particular consideration.\"[7]  Gaelic football is played by teams of 15 on a rectangular grass pitch with H-shaped goals at each end. The primary object is to score by driving the ball through the goals, which is known as a goal (worth 3 points), or by kicking the ball over the bar, which is known as a point (worth 1 point). The team with the highest point score at the end of the match wins.[8] The female version of the game is known as ladies' Gaelic football and is similar to the men's game with a few minor rule changes.[9] Other formats with teams of 7 to 11 players are played in Europe,[10] Middle East, Asia, Argentina and South Africa utilising smaller soccer or rugby pitches.  Hurling is a stick and ball game played by teams of 15 on a rectangular grass pitch with H-shaped goals at each end. The primary object is to score by driving the ball through the goals or putting the ball over the bar and thereby scoring a point.  Three points is the equivalent of a goal. The team with the highest score at the end of the match wins.  It is over three thousand years old, and is said to be the world's fastest field game, combining skills from lacrosse, field hockey, and baseball in a hard-hitting, highly skilled game.[11] The female version of the game is known as camogie and is very similar to hurling with a few minor rule changes.[12] Other formats with teams of 7 to 11 players are played in Europe,[10] Middle East, Asia, Argentina and South Africa utilising smaller soccer or rugby pitches.  Gaelic handball is a game in which two players use their hands to return a ball against a wall. The game is similar to American handball. There are four codes of handball: Softball (also known as '60x30' or 'big alley' due to the playing court dimensions), 4-Wall (also known as '40x20' or 'small alley'), 1-Wall and Hardball (can also be known as '60x30'; played in the same court as Softball). 1-Wall handball is the most popular international version of handball, played in over 30 countries. The sport's governing body, GAA Handball, oversees and promotes the game in Ireland.[13]  Rounders is a bat-and-ball game which is played in Ireland; a similar version is played in Britain. Rounders is organised by a subdivision of the GAA known as the Rounders Council of Ireland. It is similar to the American game softball.[14]  Other Gaelic games such as Gaelic athletics have nearly or completely died out. When founded the GAA organised a number of Gaelic athletics competitions but passed the responsibility to the National Athletic and Cycling Association in 1922. Tailteann Games with Gaelic athletics were held until 1932.[15] "},{"title":"Determining the Outcome of a Match (association football)","content":"Determining the Outcome of a Match is the 10th of the Laws of the Game of association football.[1]  It addresses two aspects of the game:  The current name and content of Law 10 date from 2016.[2]  From 1938 until 2016, Law 10 was titled \"Method of Scoring\", and addressed only the procedure for scoring a goal.[3][4]  Procedures for breaking ties were addressed, if at all, in a supplemental section of the laws.[5]  In most games, a draw is an allowable outcome. League competitions using the common three points for a win system award a single point to both teams for a drawn match.   However in some competitions, primarily knock-out tournaments, it is necessary to resolve a victor. Some competitions employ replays, otherwise there are three procedures permitted by Law 10 to determine the winner of a drawn match:[1]  Normally these are applied in the order listed above \u2014 i.e. for a two legged match, extra time is played if the away goals rule does not determine a victor. After extra time, if the score is still level, a penalty shoot-out takes place.  In a few cup competitions extra time is ignored completely and the game goes directly to penalties. Most of the time this applies to the whole tournament and as is decided before the tournament begins, but on rare occasions can be decided for individual games before kick off. Examples of where this happens include the EFL Cup and County Cups.[6]  Most codes of football from before 1863 provided only one means of scoring (typically called the \"goal\", although Harrow football used the word \"base\").[7] The two major exceptions (the Eton field game and Sheffield rules, which borrowed the concept from Eton) both used the \"rouge\" (a touchdown, somewhat similar to a try in today's rugby) as a tie-breaker.    The 1863 laws of the game provided for only one means of scoring: the goal.  There was no procedure to break ties.   In February 1866, association football briefly adopted a tie-breaker known as the \"touch down\" (plural: \"touches down\").  This \"touch down\" had similarities to the \"rouge\" used in the Eton field game and Sheffield rules, and also to the try in today's rugby codes.  It was defined thus:[8]  In case the ball goes behind the goal line, a player on the side to whom the goal belongs shall kick it off from the goal line, at the point opposite the place where the ball is touched by a player with any part of his body; but if a player of the opposite side first touches the ball, after it has gone behind the goal line of his adversary, one \"touch down\" shall be scored by his side, and in the event of no goals being got on either side, or an equal number of goals being got on each side, the side obtaining the greater number of \"touches down\" shall be the winners of the match An example of a game being decided by \"touches down\" is Barnes FC v. Civil Service FC, played on Saturday December 8th, 1866.  The match \"resulted in a victory for the Civil Service by three touches down to none, no goal being obtained by either side\".[9]  In the historic London v. Sheffield match played on March 31, 1866, \"London\" (a representative team from the Football Association) won by two goals and four touches down to nil.[10]  The \"touch down\" lasted only one year.  It was abolished in February 1867, on the basis of a proposal by Wanderers FC.[11]  FA Secretary Robert Graham later explained the benefit of its removal, writing that \"the whole play is now directed to obtaining a goal, whereas formerly this chief object in the game was frequently lost sight of in the efforts to obtain a 'touch down'\".[12]   In 1923,  the following statement was added to the Laws of the Game:[13]  A game shall be won by the team scoring the greater number of goals. If no goals have been scored, or the scores are equal at the end of the game, the game shall be drawn This change was made in order to prevent the use of the corner-kick as a tie-breaker.[14]  Between 1867 and 1970, the laws of the game said nothing about the means by which ties should be broken in a tournament which required a definitive result.  The most common practice, as seen in the 1928 Olympics \"consolation final\" and the semi-final of the 1968 European Championships, was to use a random procedure such as drawing of lots or tossing a coin.  Despite the 1923 law mentioned above, the Dublin City Cup (until the 1960s) and Dublin and Belfast Inter-City Cup (in the 1940s) used corner count as a tiebreaker in knockout rounds.[15][16]  The use of drawing of lots was \"discontinued\" by the International Football Association Board at its 1970 meeting, to be replaced by the penalty shoot-out.[17]  The golden goal, originally known as \"sudden death\", was a procedure introduced experimentally in 1993,[18] by which the match ended immediately if a goal was scored during extra-time and the team scoring it declared to be the winner.  The golden goal was used at the 1998 and 2002 World Cup tournaments, before being abolished in 2004.[19] During the latter part of this period, a variant known as the \"silver goal\" was also used. "},{"title":"English-speaking world","content":"  The English-speaking world comprises the 88 countries and territories in which English is an official, administrative, or cultural language. In the early 2000s, one billion to two billion people spoke English,[1][2] making it the largest language by number of speakers, the third largest language by number of native speakers, and the most widespread language geographically. The countries in which English is the native language of most people are sometimes termed the Anglosphere. Speakers of English are called Anglophones.   England and the Scottish Lowlands, a country and a region of the United Kingdom, are the birthplace of the English language; the modern form of the language has been spread around the world since the 17th century, first by the worldwide influence of England and later the United Kingdom, and then by that of the United States. Through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries, English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional fields, such as science, navigation and law.[3]  The United States and India have the most total English speakers, with 306 million and 265 million, respectively. These are followed by Pakistan (104 million), the United Kingdom (68 million), and Nigeria (60 million).[4] As of 2022, there were about 400 million native speakers of English.[5]  Including people who speak English as a second language, estimates of the total number of Anglophones vary from 1.5 billion to 2 billion.[2] David Crystal calculated in 2003 that non-native speakers outnumbered native speakers by a ratio of three to one.[6]  Besides the major varieties of English\u2014American, British, Canadian, Australian, Irish, New Zealand English\u2014and their sub-varieties, countries such as South Africa, India, Nigeria, the Philippines, Singapore, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago also have millions of native speakers of dialect continua ranging from English-based creole languages to Standard English. Other countries and territories, such as Ghana, also use English as their primary official language even though it is not the native language of most of the people.  English is the primary natively spoken language in several countries and territories. Five of the largest of these are sometimes described as the \"core Anglosphere\";[7][8][9] they are the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.  The term \"Anglosphere\" can sometimes be extended to include other countries and territories where English or an English Creole language is also the primary native language and English is the primary language of government and education, such as Ireland, Gibraltar, and the Commonwealth Caribbean.[10]  While English is also spoken by a majority of people as a second language in a handful of countries such as Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden, these countries are not considered part of the English-speaking world as the language is still viewed primarily as a foreign tongue and does not serve an important cultural role in society.[11]  English is an official language (de facto and de jure) of the following countries and territories.[12]  Although not official, English is also an important language in some former colonies and protectorates of the British Empire where it is used as an administrative language, such as Bahrain, Brunei, Egypt, Kuwait, Malaysia, Qatar, Sri Lanka and United Arab Emirates.  Because English is so widely spoken, it has often been called a \"world language\", the lingua franca of the modern era,[13] and while it is not an official language in most countries, it is currently the language most often taught as a foreign language.[6][14] It is, by international treaty, the official language for aeronautical[15] and maritime[16] communications. English is one of the official languages of the United Nations and many other international organizations, including the International Olympic Committee. It is also one of two co-official languages for astronauts (besides the Russian language) serving on board the International Space Station.[citation needed]  English is studied most often in the European Union, and the perception of the usefulness of foreign languages among Europeans is 67% in favour of English, ahead of 17% for German and 16% for French (as of 2012[update]). In some of the non\u2013English-speaking EU countries, the following percentages of adults claimed to be able to converse in English in 2012: 90% in the Netherlands; 89% in Malta; 86% in Sweden and Denmark; 73% in Cyprus, Croatia, and Austria; 70% in Finland; and over 50% in Greece, Belgium, Luxembourg, Slovenia, and Germany. In 2012, excluding native speakers, 38% of Europeans consider that they can speak English.[17]  Books, magazines, and newspapers written in English are available in many countries around the world; English is the most commonly used language in the sciences,[13] with Science Citation Index reporting as early as 1997 that 95% of its articles were written in English, even though only half of them came from authors in English-speaking countries.  In publishing, English literature predominates considerably, with 28% of all books published in the world [Leclerc 2011][full citation needed] and 30% of web content in 2011 (down from 50% in 2000).[14]  The increasing use of the English language globally has had a large impact on many other languages, leading to language shift and language death,[18] and to claims of linguistic imperialism.[citation needed] English itself has become more open to language shift as multiple regional varieties feed back into the language as a whole.[19] "},{"title":"Football player","content":"  A football player or footballer is a sportsperson who plays one of the different types of football. The main types of football are association football, American football, Canadian football, Australian rules football, Gaelic football, rugby league, and rugby union.  It has been estimated that there are 250 million association football players in the world,[1] and many play other forms of football.  Jean-Pierre Papin has described football as a \"universal language\".[2] Footballers across the world and at almost any level may regularly attract large crowds of spectators, and players are the focal points of widespread social phenomena such as association football culture.  Footballers generally begin as amateurs and the best players progress to become professional players. Normally they start at a youth team (any local team) and from there, based on skill and talent, scouts offer contracts. Once signed, some learn to play better football and a few advance to the senior or professional teams.  Pay in some top men's leagues is significantly higher than in other jobs. Players in the Premier League earn an average of $3 million per year.[3] In the wealthiest clubs in European football leagues, men earn an average $7.19 million per year.[4] The best players of those clubs can earn up to $260 million per year.[5]  However, only a fraction of men's professional football players are paid at this level. Wages may be somewhat more moderate in other divisions and leagues. For example, the average annual salary for footballers in Major League Soccer (MLS) is $530,262 as of May 2023.[6]  Average salaries in women's leagues are far lower. For example, players in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), which started in 2012, earn an average of $54,000 per year as of May 2022.[7] For the first time in 2022, the NWSL guaranteed players a living wage. The minimum salary in 2023 is $36,400 to ensure players do not need second or third jobs to survive.[8]  A minority of retired footballers continue working full-time in football, for instance as football managers. A 1979 study reported that former first-team ballplayers were over-represented as top-ranking executives in their companies and had greater income mobility than second-teamers and reserves.[9] However, some experience chronic health issues, see below.  In association football, there are four traditional types of specialties (positions): goalkeepers (goalies), defenders (full-backs), midfielders (half-backs), and forwards (attackers). Special purpose positions include such performers as sweepers, stoppers, second forwards (under-attackers), wingers, insiders, etc.  The American football teams' positions are categorized by a form of play where each of them has its spectrum of positions. Those are offensive, defensive, and special teams.  Research shows that association football players who take less than 200 milliseconds after the referee blows their whistle to make a penalty kick are significantly less likely to score than those who take over a second.[16][17]  An Irish 2002 study of association and Gaelic football players characterized players as \"lean and muscular with a reasonably high level of capacity in all areas of physical performance\".[18] The opposite is the case for American football, where obesity could be the cause of grave health problems.[19]  A 2000 study documented injuries sustained by Czech [association] football players at all levels:[20]  Trauma was the cause of 81.5% of the injuries, and overuse was the cause of 18.5%. Joint sprains predominated (30%), followed by fractures (16%), muscle strains (15%), ligament ruptures (12%), meniscal tears and contusions (8%), and other injuries. Injuries to the knee were most prevalent (29%), followed by injuries to the ankle (19%) and spine (9%). More injuries occurred during games (59%) than in practice. [21] Patellar tendinitis (knee pain) is considered an injury that comes from overexertion, which also happens to other athletes of virtually every sport. It is a common problem that football players develop and can usually be treated by a quadriceps strengthening program. Jumping activities place particularly high strains on the tendon and with repetitive jumping, tearing and injury of the tendon can occur. The chronic injury and healing response results in inflammation and localized pain.[22]  Although levels of depression and pain in retired football players are on par with the societal average,[23] some players suffer from post-retirement chronic injuries. Head injuries are a particular concern.  Studies have long shown former American football NFL players have a longer life expectancy than the general public or males with a similar age and race distribution, but a higher rate of cardiovascular issues.[24] A study comparing the deaths of former Major League Baseball players found baseball players lived longer still, perhaps suggesting a \"healthy worker\" bias where NFL athletes lived less long than they would otherwise have, despite their longer than average life expectancy.[25]  A 2009 review of the evidence in the American Journal of Medicine concluded the existing evidence \"did not suggest an increased mortality\" but does \"suggest increased cardiovascular risk..., particularly the heavier linemen.\"[26]  In association football, a 2011 German study found that German national team players lived 1.9 years less than the general male population.[27]  Football players participating in international matches for Germany have reduced longevity compared to the general population. This disadvantage was the larger, the earlier the international football player started his international career. This finding is in line with the current knowledge of life expectancy in major athletes, especially those from other team sports A 1983 study of rugby players found that the life expectancy of All Blacks was the same as for the general population.[28]  Australian rules footballers have lower death rates than the general population.[29]  American football players are prone to head injuries such as concussions. In later life, this increases the risk of dementia[30] and Alzheimer's.[31] Professional American football players self-reporting concussions are at greater risk for having depressive episodes later in life compared with those retired players self-reporting no concussions.[32][33]  Probably due to the repeated trauma associated with heading balls, professional association football has been suggested to increase the incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[34] In a 1987 study of former Norwegian association football national team players, one third of the players were found to have central cerebral atrophy, i.e. brain damage.[35] A 1999 study connected soccer to chronic traumatic head injury (CTHI):[36]  [P]articipation in amateur association football in general and concussion specifically is associated with impaired performance in memory and planning functions. Due to the worldwide popularity of soccer, these observations may have important public health implications Anterior cruciate ligaments are particularly vulnerable in most types of football due to injuries that can be sustained during tackles.  An increased incidence of osteoarthritis in the hip joint has been found in retired football players.[37]  A 2012 study of association football injuries found that 19% of all injuries were muscle injuries, of which 54% affected the thigh muscles.[38]  In a 2009 study, association football was found to be associated with favourable sleep patterns and psychological functioning in adolescent male football players.[39]  The rate of suicide among NFL vets has been found to be 59% lower than in the general population.[40]  In 2012, FIFA released a paper intended to identify key risk factors for association football players.[41]  In 2015, a systematic review of a sample of fifty-four peer-reviewed publications and three articles on elite athletes\u2019 mortality and longevity, resulted in major longevity outcomes for the elite athletes (baseball, football, soccer, basketball, and cycling) \"compared to age and sex-matched controls from the general population and other athletes.\" The span longevities were influenced by factors like the type of sport, the playing position, the race, and the energy system.[42]  An observational study held from professional footballers -active (during their career) and recently retired (post-career, aged more than 45 years)- in 70 countries between 2007 and 2013, elaborated on data from the World Footballers' Union (FIFPro), recorded 214 deaths of which 25% was caused by accidents, 11% by suicides and 33% by a suspected cardiac pathology (on an overall 55% of deaths caused by some sort of disease).[43]  Clinical evaluation, ECG , and echocardiography are required for the athletes as pre-participation tools in order to prevent sudden cardiac deaths in people aged less than 35. To evaluate the risk of myocardial fibrosis, may use and recommend the additional use of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) with pre- and post-contrast and extracellular volume fraction (ECV) images.[44] Even encouraged, it wasn't yet made mandatory.  In 2015, 205 deaths among North American professional athletes who were registered as active at the time of their decease were analysed. Data were collected for the four major sports: National Basketball Association (NBA), National Football League (NFL), National Hockey League (NHL), and Major League Baseball (MLB). The NFL and NBA active players had \"a higher likelihood of dying in a car accident\" and a significantly higher likelihood of dying from a cardiac-related illness compared to the NHL and MLB active populations.[45]  In 2013, a study on 3,439 retired athletes of the National Football Leagues with at least five credited playing seasons between 1959 and 1988 did not show a statistical correlation between suicide mortality and professional activity, particularly football-related compared with the general control sample. No stratification was reported between speed and non-speed position players.[46]  Until the 2000s a very limited number of formal studies has been published on mortality from all causes in soccer players, despite the high interest of the public to the matter. An extended study held in Italy between 1975 and 2003 on a total of 5.389 players, aged 14\u201335 years, highlighted that, while the mortality for cancer and cardiovascular diseases among the football players cohort was significantly lower than the general Italian population, the \"mortality rates for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and car accidents were significantly higher than expected, and for ALS the risk is 18 times than expected.\"[47] "},{"title":"French language","content":"  French (fran\u00e7ais, French: [f\u0281\u0251\u0303s\u025b], or langue fran\u00e7aise, French: [l\u0251\u0303\u0261 f\u0281\u0251\u0303s\u025b\u02d0z]) is a Romance language of the Indo-European family. It descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire, as did all Romance languages. French evolved from Gallo-Romance, the Latin spoken in Gaul, and more specifically in Northern Gaul. Its closest relatives are the other langues d'o\u00efl\u2014languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium, which French (Francien) largely supplanted. French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the (Germanic) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders. Today, owing to the French colonial empire, there are numerous French-based creole languages, most notably Haitian Creole. A French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as Francophone in both English and French.  French is an official language in 28 countries and is spoken across all continents.[2] French is also the second most geographically widespread language in the world after English, with about 50 countries and territories having it as a de jure or de facto official, administrative, or cultural language.[3]  Most of these countries are members of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie (OIF), the community of 54 member states which share the official use or teaching of French. French is also one of six official languages used in the United Nations.[4] It is spoken as a first language (in descending order of the number of speakers) in France; Canada (especially in the provinces of Quebec, Ontario, and New Brunswick); Belgium (Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region); western Switzerland (specifically the cantons forming the Romandy region); parts of Luxembourg; parts of the United States (the states of Louisiana, Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont); Monaco; the Aosta Valley region of Italy; and various communities elsewhere.[5]  In 2015, approximately 40% of the francophone population (including L2 and partial speakers) lived in Europe, 36% in sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian Ocean, 15% in North Africa and the Middle East, 8% in the Americas, and 1% in Asia and Oceania.[6] French is the second-most widely spoken mother tongue in the European Union.[7] Of Europeans who speak other languages natively, approximately one-fifth are able to speak French as a second language.[8] French is the second-most taught foreign language in the EU. All institutions of the EU use French as a working language along with English and German; in certain institutions, French is the sole working language (e.g. at the Court of Justice of the European Union).[9] French is also the 16th most natively spoken language in the world, fifth most spoken language by total number of speakers and is on the top five of the most studied languages worldwide (with about 120 million learners as of 2017).[10] As a result of French and Belgian colonialism from the 16th century onward, French was introduced to new territories in the Americas, Africa and Asia. Most second-language speakers reside in Francophone Africa, particularly Gabon, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Mauritius, Senegal and Ivory Coast.[11]  French is estimated to have about 76 million native speakers; about 235\u00a0million daily, fluent speakers;[12][1][13] and another 77\u2013110\u00a0million secondary speakers who speak it as a second language to varying degrees of proficiency, mainly in Africa.[14] According to the OIF, approximately 321 million people worldwide are \"able to speak the language\",[15] without specifying the criteria for this estimation or whom it encompasses.[16] According to a demographic projection led by the Universit\u00e9 Laval and the R\u00e9seau D\u00e9mographie de l'Agence universitaire de la Francophonie, the total number of French speakers will reach approximately 500 million in 2025 and 650\u00a0million by 2050.[17] OIF estimates 700 million by 2050, 80% of whom will be in Africa.[6]  French has a long history as an international language of literature and scientific standards and is a primary or second language of many international organisations including the United Nations, the European Union, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the World Trade Organization, the International Olympic Committee, the General Conference on Weights and Measures, and the International Committee of the Red Cross. In 2011, Bloomberg Businessweek ranked French the third most useful language for business, after English and Standard Mandarin Chinese.[18]  French is a Romance language (meaning that it is descended primarily from Vulgar Latin) that evolved out of the Gallo-Romance dialects spoken in northern France. The language's early forms include Old French and Middle French.  Due to Roman rule, Latin was gradually adopted by the inhabitants of Gaul, and as the language was learned by the common people it developed a distinct local character, with grammatical differences from Latin as spoken elsewhere, some of which being attested on graffiti.[19] This local variety evolved into the Gallo-Romance tongues, which include French and its closest relatives, such as Arpitan.  The evolution of Latin in Gaul was shaped by its coexistence for over half a millennium beside the native Celtic Gaulish language, which did not go extinct until the late sixth century, long after the fall of the Western Roman Empire.[20] The population remained 90% indigenous in origin;[21][22] the Romanizing class were the local native elite (not Roman settlers), whose children learned Latin in Roman schools. At the time of the collapse of the Empire, this local elite had been slowly abandoning Gaulish entirely, but the rural and lower class populations remained Gaulish speakers who could sometimes also speak Latin or Greek.[23] The final language shift from Gaulish to Vulgar Latin among rural and lower class populations occurred later, when both they and the incoming Frankish ruler\/military class adopted the Gallo-Roman Vulgar Latin speech of the urban intellectual elite.[23]  The Gaulish language likely survived into the sixth century in France despite considerable Romanization.[20] Coexisting with Latin, Gaulish helped shape the Vulgar Latin dialects that developed into French[23][20] contributing loanwords and calques (including oui,[24] the word for \"yes\"),[25] sound changes shaped by Gaulish influence,[26][27][28] and influences in conjugation and word order.[25][29][19] Recent computational studies suggest that early gender shifts may have been motivated by the gender of the corresponding word in Gaulish.[30]  The estimated number of French words that can be attributed to Gaulish is placed at 154 by the Petit Robert,[31] which is often viewed as representing standardized French, while if non-standard dialects are included, the number increases to 240.[32] Known Gaulish loans are skewed toward certain semantic fields, such as plant life (ch\u00eane, bille, etc.), animals (mouton, cheval, etc.), nature (boue, etc.), domestic activities (ex. berceau), farming and rural units of measure (arpent, lieue, borne, boisseau), weapons,[33] and products traded regionally rather than further afield.[34] This semantic distribution has been attributed to peasants being the last to hold onto Gaulish.[34][33]  The beginning of French in Gaul was greatly influenced by Germanic invasions into the country. These invasions had the greatest impact on the northern part of the country and on the language there.[35] A language divide began to grow across the country. The population in the north spoke langue d'o\u00efl while the population in the south spoke langue d'oc.[35] Langue d'o\u00efl grew into what is known as Old French. The period of Old French spanned between the 8th and 14th centuries. Old French shared many characteristics with Latin. For example, Old French made use of different possible word orders just as Latin did because it had a case system that retained the difference between nominative subjects and oblique non-subjects.[36] The period is marked by a heavy superstrate influence from the Germanic Frankish language, which non-exhaustively included the use in upper-class speech and higher registers of V2 word order,[37] a large percentage of the vocabulary (now at around 15% of modern French vocabulary[38]) including the impersonal singular pronoun on (a calque of Germanic man), and the name of the language itself.  Up until its later stages, Old French, alongside Old Occitan, maintained a relic of the old nominal case system of Latin longer than most other Romance languages (with the notable exception of Romanian which still currently maintains a case distinction), differentiating between an oblique case and a nominative case. The phonology was characterized by heavy syllabic stress, which led to the emergence of various complicated diphthongs such as -eau which would later be leveled to monophthongs.[citation needed]  The earliest evidence of what became Old French can be seen in the Oaths of Strasbourg and the Sequence of Saint Eulalia, while Old French literature began to be produced in the eleventh century, with major early works often focusing on the lives of saints (such as the Vie de Saint Alexis), or wars and royal courts, notably including the Chanson de Roland, epic cycles focused on King Arthur and his court, as well as a cycle focused on William of Orange.[citation needed]  Within Old French many dialects emerged but the Francien dialect is one that not only continued but also thrived during the Middle French period (14th\u201317th centuries).[35] Modern French grew out of this Francien dialect.[35] Grammatically, during the period of Middle French, noun declensions were lost and there began to be standardized rules. Robert Estienne published the first Latin-French dictionary, which included information about phonetics, etymology, and grammar.[39] Politically, the first government authority to adopt Modern French as official was the Aosta Valley in 1536, while the Ordinance of Villers-Cotter\u00eats (1539) named French the language of law in the Kingdom of France.  During the 17th century, French replaced Latin as the most important language of diplomacy and international relations (lingua franca). It retained this role until approximately the middle of the 20th century, when it was replaced by English as the United States became the dominant global power following the Second World War.[40][41] Stanley Meisler of the Los Angeles Times said that the fact that the Treaty of Versailles was written in English as well as French was the \"first diplomatic blow\" against the language.[42]  During the Grand Si\u00e8cle (17th century), France, under the rule of powerful leaders such as Cardinal Richelieu and Louis XIV, enjoyed a period of prosperity and prominence among European nations. Richelieu established the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise to protect the French language. By the early 1800s, Parisian French had become the primary language of the aristocracy in France.  Near the beginning of the 19th century, the French government began to pursue policies with the end goal of eradicating the many minorities and regional languages (patois) spoken in France. This began in 1794 with Henri Gr\u00e9goire's \"Report on the necessity and means to annihilate the patois and to universalize the use of the French language\". When public education was made compulsory, only French was taught and the use of any other (patois) language was punished. The goals of the public school system were made especially clear to the French-speaking teachers sent to teach students in regions such as Occitania and Brittany. Instructions given by a French official to teachers in the department of Finist\u00e8re, in western Brittany, included the following: \"And remember, Gents: you were given your position in order to kill the Breton language\".[43] The prefect of Basses-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es in the French Basque Country wrote in 1846: \"Our schools in the Basque Country are particularly meant to replace the Basque language with French...\"[43] Students were taught that their ancestral languages were inferior and they should be ashamed of them; this process was known in the Occitan-speaking region as Vergonha.  Spoken by 19.71% of the European Union's population, French is the third most widely spoken language in the EU, after English and German and the second-most-widely taught language after English.[7][45]  Under the Constitution of France, French has been the official language of the Republic since 1992,[46] although the Ordinance of Villers-Cotter\u00eats made it mandatory for legal documents in 1539. France mandates the use of French in official government publications, public education except in specific cases, and legal contracts; advertisements must bear a translation of foreign words.  In Belgium, French is an official language at the federal level along with Dutch and German. At the regional level, French is the sole official language of Wallonia (excluding a part of the East Cantons, which are German-speaking) and one of the two official languages\u2014along with Dutch\u2014of the Brussels-Capital Region, where it is spoken by the majority of the population (approx. 80%), often as their primary language.[47]  French is one of the four official languages of Switzerland, along with German, Italian, and Romansh, and is spoken in the western part of Switzerland, called Romandy, of which Geneva is the largest city. The language divisions in Switzerland do not coincide with political subdivisions, and some cantons have bilingual status: for example, cities such as Biel\/Bienne and cantons such as Valais, Fribourg and Bern. French is the native language of about 23% of the Swiss population, and is spoken by 50%[48] of the population.  Along with Luxembourgish and German, French is one of the three official languages of Luxembourg, where it is generally the preferred language of business as well as of the different public administrations. It is also the official language of Monaco.  At a regional level, French is acknowledged as an official language in the Aosta Valley region of Italy where it is the first language of approximately 50% of the population,[49] while French dialects remain spoken by minorities on the Channel Islands. It is also spoken in Andorra and is the main language after Catalan in El Pas de la Casa. The language is taught as the primary second language in the German state of Saarland, with French being taught from pre-school and over 43% of citizens being able to speak French.[50][51]  The majority of the world's French-speaking population lives in Africa. According to a 2023 estimate from the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, an estimated 167 million African people spread across 35 countries and territories[b] can speak French as either a first or a second language.[54][55] This number does not include the people living in non-Francophone African countries who have learned French as a foreign language. Due to the rise of French in Africa, the total French-speaking population worldwide is expected to reach 700 million people in 2050.[56] French is the fastest growing language on the continent (in terms of either official or foreign languages).[57][58] French is mostly a second language in Africa, but it has become a first language in some urban areas, such as the region of Abidjan, Ivory Coast[59] and in Libreville, Gabon.[60] There is not a single African French, but multiple forms that diverged through contact with various indigenous African languages.[61]  Sub-Saharan Africa is the region where the French language is most likely to expand, because of the expansion of education and rapid population growth.[62] It is also where the language has evolved the most in recent years.[63][64] Some vernacular forms of French in Africa can be difficult to understand for French speakers from other countries,[65] but written forms of the language are very closely related to those of the rest of the French-speaking world.  French is the second-most common language in Canada, after English, and both are official languages at the federal level. It is the first language of 9.5\u00a0million people or 29% and the second language for 2.07\u00a0million or 6% of the entire population of Canada.[13] French is the sole official language in the province of Quebec, being the mother tongue for some 7 million people, or almost 80% (2006 Census) of the province[citation needed]. About 95% of the people of Quebec speak French as either their first or second language, and for some as their third language. Quebec is also home to the city of Montreal, which is the world's fourth-largest French-speaking city, by number of first language speakers.[citation needed] New Brunswick and Manitoba are the only officially bilingual provinces, though full bilingualism is enacted only in New Brunswick, where about one third of the population is Francophone. French is also an official language of all of the territories (Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon). Out of the three, Yukon has the most French speakers, making up just under 4% of the population.[66] Furthermore, while French is not an official language in Ontario, the French Language Services Act ensures that provincial services are to be available in the language. The Act applies to areas of the province where there are significant Francophone communities, namely Eastern Ontario and Northern Ontario. Elsewhere, sizable French-speaking minorities are found in southern Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and the Port au Port Peninsula in Newfoundland and Labrador, where the unique Newfoundland French dialect was historically spoken. Smaller pockets of French speakers exist in all other provinces. The Ontarian city of Ottawa, the Canadian capital, is also effectively bilingual, as it has a large population of federal government workers, who are required to offer services in both French and English, and is across a river from Quebec, opposite the major city of Gatineau with which it forms a single metropolitan area.[citation needed]  According to the United States Census Bureau (2011), French is the fourth[67] most spoken language in the United States after English, Spanish, and Chinese, when all forms of French are considered together and all dialects of Chinese are similarly combined. French is the second-most spoken language (after English) in the states of Maine and New Hampshire. In Louisiana, it is tied with Spanish for second-most spoken if Louisiana French and all creoles such as Haitian are included. French is the third most spoken language (after English and Spanish) in the states of Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire.[68] Louisiana is home to many distinct French dialects, collectively known as Louisiana French. New England French, essentially a variant of Canadian French, is spoken in parts of New England. Missouri French was historically spoken in Missouri and Illinois (formerly known as Upper Louisiana), but is nearly extinct today.[69] French also survived in isolated pockets along the Gulf Coast of what was previously French Lower Louisiana, such as Mon Louis Island, Alabama and DeLisle, Mississippi (the latter only being discovered by linguists in the 1990s) but these varieties are severely endangered or presumed extinct.  French is one of two official languages in Haiti alongside Haitian Creole. It is the principal language of education, administration, business, and public signage and is spoken by all educated Haitians. It is also used for ceremonial events such as weddings, graduations, and church masses. The vast majority of the population speaks Haitian Creole as their first language; the rest largely speak French as a first language.[70] As a French Creole language, Haitian Creole draws the large majority of its vocabulary from French, with influences from West African languages, as well as several European languages. It is closely related to Louisiana Creole and the creole from the Lesser Antilles.[71]  French is the sole official language of all the overseas territories of France in the Caribbean that are collectively referred to as the French West Indies, namely Guadeloupe, Saint Barth\u00e9lemy, Saint Martin, and Martinique.  French is the official language of both French Guiana on the South American continent,[72] and of Saint Pierre and Miquelon,[73] an archipelago off the coast of Newfoundland in North America.  French was the official language of the colony of French Indochina, comprising modern-day Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. It continues to be an administrative language in Laos and Cambodia, although its influence has waned in recent decades.[74] In colonial Vietnam, the elites primarily spoke French, while many servants who worked in French households spoke a French pidgin known as \"T\u00e2y B\u1ed3i\" (now extinct). After French rule ended, South Vietnam continued to use French in administration, education, and trade.[75] However, since the Fall of Saigon and the opening of a unified Vietnam's economy, French has gradually been effectively displaced as the first foreign language of choice by English in Vietnam. Nevertheless, it continues to be taught as the other main foreign language in the Vietnamese educational system and is regarded as a cultural language.[76] All three countries are full members of La Francophonie (OIF).  French was the official language of French India, consisting of the geographically separate enclaves referred to as Puducherry. It continued to be an official language of the territory even after its cession to India in 1956 until 1965.[77] A small number of older locals still retain knowledge of the language, although it has now given way to Tamil and English.[77][78]  A former French mandate, Lebanon designates Arabic as the sole official language, while a special law regulates cases when French can be publicly used. Article 11 of Lebanon's Constitution states that \"Arabic is the official national language. A law determines the cases in which the French language is to be used\".[79] The French language in Lebanon is a widespread second language among the Lebanese people, and is taught in many schools along with Arabic and English. French is used on Lebanese pound banknotes, on road signs, on Lebanese license plates, and on official buildings (alongside Arabic).  Today, French and English are secondary languages of Lebanon, with about 40% of the population being Francophone and 40% Anglophone.[80] The use of English is growing in the business and media environment. Out of about 900,000 students, about 500,000 are enrolled in Francophone schools, public or private, in which the teaching of mathematics and scientific subjects is provided in French.[81] Actual usage of French varies depending on the region and social status. One-third of high school students educated in French go on to pursue higher education in English-speaking institutions. English is the language of business and communication, with French being an element of social distinction, chosen for its emotional value.[82]  The UAE has the status in the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie as an observer state, and Qatar has the status in the organization as an associate state. However, in both countries, French is not spoken by almost any of the general population or migrant workers, but spoken by a small minority of those who invest in Francophone countries or have other financial or family ties. Their entrance as observer and associate states respectively into the organization was aided a good deal by their investments into the Organisation and France itself.[83] A country's status as an observer state in the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie gives the country the right to send representatives to organization meetings and make formal requests to the organization but they do not have voting rights within the OIF.[84] A country's status as an associate state also does not give a country voting abilities but associate states can discuss and review organization matters.[85]  French is an official language of the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu, where 31% of the population was estimated to speak it in 2023.[55] In the French special collectivity of New Caledonia, 97% of the population can speak, read and write French[86] while in French Polynesia this figure is 95%,[87] and in the French collectivity of Wallis and Futuna, it is 84%.[88]  In French Polynesia and to a lesser extent Wallis and Futuna, where oral and written knowledge of the French language has become almost universal (95% and 84% respectively), French increasingly tends to displace the native Polynesian languages as the language most spoken at home. In French Polynesia, the percentage of the population who reported that French was the language they use the most at home rose from 67% at the 2007 census to 74% at the 2017 census.[89][87] In Wallis and Futuna, the percentage of the population who reported that French was the language they use the most at home rose from 10% at the 2008 census to 13% at the 2018 census.[88][90]  The future of the French language is often discussed in the news. For example, in 2014, The New York Times documented an increase in the teaching of French in New York, especially in K-12 dual-language programs where Spanish and Mandarin are the only second-language options more popular than French.[91] In a study published in March 2014 by Forbes, the investment bank Natixis said that French could become the world's most spoken language by 2050. It noted that French is spreading in areas where the population is rapidly increasing, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.[92][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]  In the European Union, French was the dominant language within all institutions until the 1990s. After several enlargements of the EU (1995, 2004), French significantly lost ground in favour of English, which is more widely spoken and taught in most EU countries. French currently remains one of the three working languages, or \"procedural languages\", of the EU, along with English and German. It is the second-most widely used language within EU institutions after English, but remains the preferred language of certain institutions or administrations such as the Court of Justice of the European Union, where it is the sole internal working language, or the Directorate-General for Agriculture. Since 2016, Brexit has rekindled discussions on whether or not French should again hold greater role within the institutions of the European Union.[93]  A leading world language, French is taught in universities around the world, and is one of the world's most influential languages because of its wide use in the worlds of journalism, jurisprudence, education, and diplomacy.[94] In diplomacy, French is one of the six official languages of the United Nations (and one of the UN Secretariat's only two working languages[95]), one of twenty official and three procedural languages of the European Union, an official language of NATO, the International Olympic Committee, the Council of Europe, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Organization of American States (alongside Spanish, Portuguese and English), the Eurovision Song Contest, one of eighteen official languages of the European Space Agency, World Trade Organization and the least used of the three official languages in the North American Free Trade Agreement countries. It is also a working language in nonprofit organisations such as the Red Cross (alongside English, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and Russian), Amnesty International (alongside 32 other languages of which English is the most used, followed by Spanish, Portuguese, German, and Italian), M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (used alongside English, Spanish, Portuguese and Arabic), and M\u00e9decins du Monde (used alongside English).[96] Given the demographic prospects of the French-speaking nations of Africa, researcher Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry wrote in 2014 that French \"could be the language of the future\".[97]  Significant as a judicial language, French is one of the official languages of such major international and regional courts, tribunals, and dispute-settlement bodies as the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights, the Caribbean Court of Justice, the Court of Justice for the Economic Community of West African States, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the International Court of Justice, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea the International Criminal Court and the World Trade Organization Appellate Body. It is the sole internal working language of the Court of Justice of the European Union, and makes with English the European Court of Human Rights's two working languages.[98]  In 1997, George Weber published, in Language Today, a comprehensive academic study entitled \"The World's 10 most influential languages\".[99] In the article, Weber ranked French as, after English, the second-most influential language of the world, ahead of Spanish.[99] His criteria were the numbers of native speakers, the number of secondary speakers (especially high for French among fellow world languages), the number of countries using the language and their respective populations, the economic power of the countries using the language, the number of major areas in which the language is used, and the linguistic prestige associated with the mastery of the language (Weber highlighted that French in particular enjoys considerable linguistic prestige).[99] In a 2008 reassessment of his article, Weber concluded that his findings were still correct since \"the situation among the top ten remains unchanged.\"[99]  Knowledge of French is often considered to be a useful skill by business owners in the United Kingdom; a 2014 study found that 50% of British managers considered French to be a valuable asset for their business, thus ranking French as the most sought-after foreign language there, ahead of German (49%) and Spanish (44%).[100] MIT economist Albert Saiz calculated a 2.3% premium for those who have French as a foreign language in the workplace.[101]  In English-speaking Canada, the United Kingdom, and Ireland, French is the first foreign language taught and in number of pupils is far ahead of other languages. In the United States, French is the second-most commonly taught foreign language in schools and universities, although well behind Spanish. In some areas of the country near French-speaking Quebec, however, it is the foreign language more commonly taught.  Vowel phonemes in French  Although there are many French regional accents, foreign learners normally use only one variety of the language.  French pronunciation follows strict rules based on spelling, but French spelling is often based more on history than phonology. The rules for pronunciation vary between dialects, but the standard rules are:  French is written with the 26 letters of the basic Latin script, with four diacritics appearing on vowels (circumflex accent, acute accent, grave accent, diaeresis) and the cedilla appearing in \"\u00e7\".  There are two ligatures, \"\u0153\" and \"\u00e6\", but they are often replaced in contemporary French with \"oe\" and \"ae\", because the ligatures do not appear on the AZERTY keyboard layout used in French-speaking countries. However this is nonstandard in formal and literary texts.  French spelling, like English spelling, tends to preserve obsolete pronunciation rules. This is mainly due to extreme phonetic changes since the Old French period, without a corresponding change in spelling. Moreover, some conscious changes were made to restore Latin orthography (as with some English words such as \"debt\"):  French orthography is morphophonemic. While it contains 130 graphemes that denote only 36 phonemes, many of its spelling rules are likely due to a consistency in morphemic patterns such as adding suffixes and prefixes.[102] Many given spellings of common morphemes usually lead to a predictable sound. In particular, a given vowel combination or diacritic generally leads to one phoneme. However, there is not a one-to-one relation of a phoneme and a single related grapheme, which can be seen in how tomber and tomb\u00e9 both end with the \/e\/ phoneme.[103] Additionally, there are many variations in the pronunciation of consonants at the end of words, demonstrated by how the x in paix is not pronounced though at the end of Aix it is.  As a result, it can be difficult to predict the spelling of a word based on the sound. Final consonants are generally silent, except when the following word begins with a vowel (see Liaison (French)). For example, the following words end in a vowel sound: pied, aller, les, finit, beaux. The same words followed by a vowel, however, may sound the consonants, as they do in these examples: beaux-arts, les amis, pied-\u00e0-terre.  French writing, as with any language, is affected by the spoken language. In Old French, the plural for animal was animals. The \/als\/ sequence was unstable and was turned into a diphthong \/aus\/. This change was then reflected in the orthography: animaus. The us ending, very common in Latin, was then abbreviated by copyists (monks) by the letter x, resulting in a written form animax. As the French language further evolved, the pronunciation of au turned into \/o\/ so that the u was reestablished in orthography for consistency, resulting in modern French animaux (pronounced first \/animos\/ before the final \/s\/ was dropped in contemporary French). The same is true for cheval pluralized as chevaux and many others. In addition, castel pl. castels became ch\u00e2teau pl. ch\u00e2teaux.  Some proposals exist to simplify the existing writing system, but they still fail to gather interest.[104][105][106][107]  In 1990, a reform accepted some changes to French orthography. At the time the proposed changes were considered to be suggestions. In 2016, schoolbooks in France began to use the newer recommended spellings, with instruction to teachers that both old and new spellings be deemed correct.[108]  French is a moderately inflected language. Nouns and most pronouns are inflected for number (singular or plural, though in most nouns the plural is pronounced the same as the singular even if spelled differently); adjectives, for number and gender (masculine or feminine) of their nouns; personal pronouns and a few other pronouns, for person, number, gender, and case; and verbs, for tense, aspect, mood, and the person and number of their subjects. Case is primarily marked using word order and prepositions, while certain verb features are marked using auxiliary verbs. According to the French lexicogrammatical system, French has a rank-scale hierarchy with clause as the top rank, which is followed by group rank, word rank, and morpheme rank. A French clause is made up of groups, groups are made up of words, and lastly, words are made up of morphemes.[109]  French grammar shares several notable features with most other Romance languages, including  Every French noun is either masculine or feminine. Because French nouns are not inflected for gender, a noun's form cannot specify its gender. For nouns regarding the living, their grammatical genders often correspond to that which they refer to. For example, a male teacher is an \"enseignant\" while a female teacher is an \"enseignante\". However, plural nouns that refer to a group that includes both masculine and feminine entities are always masculine. So a group of two male teachers would be \"enseignants\". A group of two male teachers and two female teachers would still be \"enseignants\". In many situations, and in the case of \"enseignant\", both the singular and plural form of a noun are pronounced identically. The article used for singular nouns is different from that used for plural nouns and the article provides a distinguishing factor between the two in speech. For example, the singular \"le professeur\" or \"la professeur(e)\" (the male or female teacher, professor) can be distinguished from the plural \"les professeurs\" because \"le\", \"la\", and \"les\" are all pronounced differently. There are some situations where both the feminine and masculine form of a noun are the same and the article provides the only difference. For example, \"le dentiste\" refers to a male dentist while \"la dentiste\" refers to a female dentist.  The French language consists of both finite and non-finite moods. The finite moods include the indicative mood (indicatif), the subjunctive mood (subjonctif), the imperative mood (imp\u00e9ratif), and the conditional mood (conditionnel). The non-finite moods include the infinitive mood (infinitif), the present participle (participe pr\u00e9sent), and the past participle (participe pass\u00e9).  The indicative mood makes use of eight tense-aspect forms. These include the present (pr\u00e9sent), the simple past (pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9 and pass\u00e9 simple), the past imperfective (imparfait), the pluperfect (plus-que-parfait), the simple future (futur simple), the future perfect (futur ant\u00e9rieur), and the past perfect (pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur). Some forms are less commonly used today. In today's spoken French, the pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9 is used while the pass\u00e9 simple is reserved for formal situations or for literary purposes. Similarly, the plus-que-parfait is used for speaking rather than the older pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur seen in literary works.  Within the indicative mood, the pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9, plus-que-parfait, futur ant\u00e9rieur, and pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur all use auxiliary verbs in their forms.  The subjunctive mood only includes four of the tense-aspect forms found in the indicative: present (pr\u00e9sent), simple past (pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9), past imperfective (imparfait), and pluperfect (plus-que-parfait).  Within the subjunctive mood, the pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9 and plus-que-parfait use auxiliary verbs in their forms.  The imperative is used in the present tense (with the exception of a few instances where it is used in the perfect tense). The imperative is used to give commands to you (tu), we\/us (nous), and plural you (vous).  The conditional makes use of the present (pr\u00e9sent) and the past (pass\u00e9).  The pass\u00e9 uses auxiliary verbs in its forms.  French uses both the active voice and the passive voice. The active voice is unmarked while the passive voice is formed by using a form of verb \u00eatre (\"to be\") and the past participle.  Example of the active voice:  Example of the passive voice:  French declarative word order is subject\u2013verb\u2013object although a pronoun object precedes the verb. Some types of sentences allow for or require different word orders, in particular inversion of the subject and verb, as in \"Parlez-vous fran\u00e7ais\u00a0?\" when asking a question rather than \"Vous parlez fran\u00e7ais\u00a0?\" Both formulations are used, and carry a rising inflection on the last word. The literal English translations are \"Do you speak French?\" and \"You speak French?\", respectively. To avoid inversion while asking a question, \"Est-ce que\" (literally \"is it that\") may be placed at the beginning of the sentence. \"Parlez-vous fran\u00e7ais\u00a0?\" may become \"Est-ce que vous parlez fran\u00e7ais\u00a0?\" French also uses verb\u2013object\u2013subject (VOS) and object\u2013subject\u2013verb (OSV) word order. OSV word order is not used often and VOS is reserved for formal writings.[36]  Root languages of loanwords[110]  The majority of French words derive from Vulgar Latin or were constructed from Latin or Greek roots. In many cases, a single etymological root appears in French in a \"popular\" or native form, inherited from Vulgar Latin, and a learned form, borrowed later from Classical Latin. The following pairs consist of a native noun and a learned adjective:  However, a historical tendency to Gallicise Latin roots can be identified, whereas English conversely leans towards a more direct incorporation of the Latin:  There are also noun-noun and adjective-adjective pairs:  It can be difficult to identify the Latin source of native French words because in the evolution from Vulgar Latin, unstressed syllables were severely reduced and the remaining vowels and consonants underwent significant modifications.  More recently (1994) the linguistic policy (Toubon Law) of the French language academies of France and Quebec has been to provide French equivalents[111] to (mainly English) imported words, either by using existing vocabulary, extending its meaning or deriving a new word according to French morphological rules. The result is often two (or more) co-existing terms for describing the same phenomenon.  It is estimated that 12% (4,200) of common French words found in a typical dictionary such as the Petit Larousse or Micro-Robert Plus (35,000 words) are of foreign origin (where Greek and Latin learned words are not seen as foreign). About 25% (1,054) of these foreign words come from English and are fairly recent borrowings. The others are some 707 words from Italian, 550 from ancient Germanic languages, 481 from other Gallo-Romance languages, 215 from Arabic, 164 from German, 160 from Celtic languages, 159 from Spanish, 153 from Dutch, 112 from Persian and Sanskrit, 101 from Native American languages, 89 from other Asian languages, 56 from other Afro-Asiatic languages, 55 from Balto-Slavic languages, 10 from Basque and 144 (about 3%) from other languages.[110]  One study analyzing the degree of differentiation of Romance languages in comparison to Latin estimated that among the languages analyzed French has the greatest distance from Latin.[112] Lexical similarity is 89% with Italian, 80% with Sardinian, 78% with Rhaeto-Romance, and 75% with Romanian, Spanish and Portuguese.[113][1]  The numeral system used in the majority of Francophone countries employs both decimal and vigesimal counting. After the use of unique names for the numbers 1\u201316, those from 17 to 69 are counted by tens, while twenty (vingt) is used as a base number in the names of numbers from 70 to 99. The French word for 80 is quatre-vingts, literally \"four twenties\", and the word for 75 is soixante-quinze, literally \"sixty-fifteen\". The vigesimal method of counting is analogous to the archaic English use of score, as in \"fourscore and seven\" (87), or \"threescore and ten\" (70).  Belgian, Swiss, and Aostan French[114] as well as that used in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Burundi, use different names for 70 and 90, namely septante and nonante. In Switzerland, depending on the local dialect, 80 can be quatre-vingts (Geneva, Neuch\u00e2tel, Jura) or huitante (Vaud, Valais, Fribourg). The Aosta Valley similarly uses huitante[114] for 80. Conversely, Belgium and in its former African colonies use quatre-vingts for 80.  In Old French (during the Middle Ages), all numbers from 30 to 99 could be said in either base 10 or base 20, e.g. vint et doze (twenty and twelve) for 32, dous vinz et diz (two twenties and ten) for 50, uitante for 80, or nonante for 90.[115]  The term octante was historically used in Switzerland for 80, but is now considered archaic.[116]  French, like most European languages, uses a space to separate thousands.[117] The comma (French: virgule) is used in French numbers as a decimal point, i.e. \"2,5\" instead of \"2.5\". In the case of currencies, the currency markers are substituted for decimal point, i.e. \"5$7\" for \"5 dollars and 7 cents\".

At the 2021 census, its population was 1,903,175,[7] making up around 3% of the UK's population and 27% of the population on the island of Ireland. The Northern Ireland Assembly, established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998, holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters, while other areas are reserved for the UK Government. The government of Northern Ireland cooperates with the government of Ireland in several areas under the terms of the Belfast Agreement.[19] The Republic of Ireland also has a consultative role on non-devolved governmental matters through the British\u2013Irish Governmental Conference (BIIG).[20]  Northern Ireland was created in 1921, when Ireland was partitioned by the Government of Ireland Act 1920, creating a devolved government for the six northeastern counties. As was intended by unionists and their supporters in Westminster, Northern Ireland had a unionist majority, who wanted to remain in the United Kingdom;[21] they were generally the Protestant descendants of colonists from Britain. Meanwhile, the majority in Southern Ireland (which became the Irish Free State in 1922), and a significant minority in Northern Ireland, were Irish nationalists (generally Catholics) who wanted a united independent Ireland.[22] Today, the former generally see themselves as British and the latter generally see themselves as Irish, while a Northern Irish or Ulster identity is claimed by a significant minority from all backgrounds.[23]  The creation of Northern Ireland was accompanied by violence both in defence of and against partition. During the conflict of 1920\u201322, the capital Belfast saw major communal violence, mainly between Protestant unionist and Catholic nationalist civilians.[24] More than 500 were killed[25] and more than 10,000 became refugees, mostly Catholics.[26] For the next fifty years, Northern Ireland had an unbroken series of Unionist Party governments.[27] There was informal mutual segregation by both communities,[28] and the Unionist governments were accused of discrimination against the Irish nationalist and Catholic minority.[29] In the late 1960s, a campaign to end discrimination against Catholics and nationalists was opposed by loyalists, who saw it as a republican front.[30] This unrest sparked the Troubles, a thirty-year conflict involving republican and loyalist paramilitaries and state forces, which claimed over 3,500 lives and injured 50,000 others.[31][32] The 1998 Good Friday Agreement was a major step in the peace process, including paramilitary disarmament and security normalisation, although sectarianism and segregation remain major social problems, and sporadic violence has continued.[33]  The economy of Northern Ireland was the most industrialised in Ireland at the time of partition, but soon began to decline, exacerbated by the political and social turmoil of the Troubles.[34] Its economy has grown significantly since the late 1990s. Unemployment in Northern Ireland peaked at 17.2% in 1986, but dropped back down to below 10% in the 2010s,[35] similar to the rate of the rest of the UK.[36] Cultural links between Northern Ireland, the rest of Ireland, and the rest of the UK are complex, with Northern Ireland sharing both the culture of Ireland and the culture of the United Kingdom. In many sports, there is an All-Ireland governing body or team for the whole island; the most notable exception is association football. Northern Ireland competes separately at the Commonwealth Games, and people from Northern Ireland may compete for either Great Britain or Ireland at the Olympic Games.  The region that is now Northern Ireland was long inhabited by native Gaels who were Irish-speaking and predominantly Catholic.[37] It was made up of several Gaelic kingdoms and territories and was part of the province of Ulster. In 1169, Ireland was invaded by a coalition of forces under the command of the English crown that quickly overran and occupied most of the island, beginning 800 years of foreign central authority. Attempts at resistance were swiftly crushed everywhere outside of Ulster. Unlike in the rest of the country, where Gaelic authority continued only in scattered, remote pockets, the major kingdoms of Ulster would mostly remain intact with English authority in the province contained to areas on the eastern coast closest to Great Britain. English power gradually eroded in the face of stubborn Irish resistance in the centuries that followed; eventually being reduced to only the city of Dublin and its suburbs. When Henry VIII launched the 16th century Tudor re-conquest of Ireland, Ulster once again resisted most effectively. In the Nine Years' War (1594\u20131603), an alliance of Gaelic chieftains led by the two most powerful Ulster lords, Hugh Roe O'Donnell and the Earl of Tyrone fought against the English government in Ireland. The Ulster-dominated alliance represented the first Irish united front; prior resistance had always been geographically localized. Despite being able to cement an alliance with Spain and major victories early on, defeat was virtually inevitable following England's victory at the siege of Kinsale. In 1607, the rebellion's leaders fled to mainland Europe alongside much of Ulster's Gaelic nobility. Their lands were confiscated by the Crown and colonized with English-speaking Protestant settlers from Britain, in the Plantation of Ulster. This led to the founding of many of Ulster's towns and created a lasting Ulster Protestant community with ties to Britain. The Irish Rebellion of 1641 began in Ulster. The rebels wanted an end to anti-Catholic discrimination, greater Irish self-governance, and to roll back the Plantation. It developed into an ethnic conflict between Irish Catholics and British Protestant settlers and became part of the wider Wars of the Three Kingdoms (1639\u201353), which ended with the English Parliamentarian conquest. Further Protestant victories in the Williamite-Jacobite War (1688\u201391) solidified Anglican Protestant rule in the Kingdom of Ireland. The Williamite victories of the siege of Derry (1689) and Battle of the Boyne (1690) are still celebrated by some Protestants in Northern Ireland.[38] Many more Scots Protestants migrated to Ulster during the Scottish famine of the 1690s.  Following the Williamite victory, and contrary to the Treaty of Limerick (1691), a series of Penal Laws were passed by the Anglican Protestant ruling class in Ireland. The intention was to disadvantage Catholics and, to a lesser extent, Presbyterians. Some 250,000 Ulster Presbyterians emigrated to the British North American colonies between 1717 and 1775.[39] It is estimated that there are more than 27\u00a0million Scotch-Irish Americans now living in the United States,[40] along with many Scotch-Irish Canadians in Canada. In the context of institutional discrimination, the 18th century saw secret, militant societies develop in Ulster and act on sectarian tensions in violent attacks. This escalated at the end of the century, especially during the County Armagh disturbances, where the Protestant Peep o' Day Boys fought the Catholic Defenders. This led to the founding of the Protestant Orange Order. The Irish Rebellion of 1798 was led by the United Irishmen; a cross-community Irish republican group founded by Belfast Presbyterians, which sought Irish independence. Following this, the government of the Kingdom of Great Britain pushed for the two kingdoms to be merged, in an attempt to quell violent sectarianism, remove discriminatory laws, and prevent the spread of French-style republicanism. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was formed in 1801 and governed from London. During the 19th century, legal reforms known as the Catholic emancipation continued to remove discrimination against Catholics, and progressive programs enabled tenant farmers to buy land from landlords.  By the late 19th century, a large and disciplined cohort of Irish Nationalist MPs at Westminster committed the Liberal Party to \"Irish Home Rule\"\u2014self-government for Ireland, within the United Kingdom. This was bitterly opposed by Irish Unionists, most of whom were Protestants, who feared an Irish devolved government dominated by Irish nationalists and Catholics. The Government of Ireland Bill 1886 and Government of Ireland Bill 1893 were defeated. However, Home Rule became a near-certainty in 1912 after the Government of Ireland Act 1914 was first introduced. The Liberal government was dependent on Nationalist support, and the Parliament Act 1911 prevented the House of Lords from blocking the bill indefinitely.[41]  In response, unionists vowed to prevent Irish Home Rule, from Conservative and Unionist Party leaders such as Bonar Law and Dublin-based barrister Edward Carson to militant working class unionists in Ireland. This sparked the Home Rule Crisis. In September 1912, more than 500,000 unionists signed the Ulster Covenant, pledging to oppose Home Rule by any means and to defy any Irish government.[42] In 1914, unionists smuggled thousands of rifles and rounds of ammunition from Imperial Germany for use by the Ulster Volunteers (UVF), a paramilitary organisation formed to oppose Home Rule. Irish nationalists had also formed a paramilitary organisation, the Irish Volunteers. It sought to ensure Home Rule was implemented, and it smuggled its own weapons into Ireland a few months after the Ulster Volunteers.[43] Ireland seemed to be on the brink of civil war.[44]  Unionists were in a minority in Ireland as a whole, but a majority in the province of Ulster, especially the counties Antrim, Down, Armagh and Londonderry.[45] Unionists argued that if Home Rule could not be stopped then all or part of Ulster should be excluded from it.[46] In May 1914, the UK Government introduced an Amending Bill to allow for 'Ulster' to be excluded from Home Rule. There was then debate over how much of Ulster should be excluded and for how long. Some Ulster unionists were willing to tolerate the 'loss' of some mainly-Catholic areas of the province.[47] The crisis was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, and Ireland's involvement in it. The UK government abandoned the Amending Bill, and instead rushed through a new bill, the Suspensory Act 1914, suspending Home Rule for the duration of the war,[48] with the exclusion of Ulster still to be decided.[49]  By the end of the war (during which the 1916 Easter Rising had taken place), most Irish nationalists now wanted full independence rather than home rule. In September 1919, British Prime Minister David Lloyd George tasked a committee with planning another home rule bill. Headed by English unionist politician Walter Long, it was known as the 'Long Committee'. It decided that two devolved governments should be established\u2014one for the nine counties of Ulster and one for the rest of Ireland\u2014together with a Council of Ireland for the \"encouragement of Irish unity\".[50] Most Ulster unionists wanted the territory of the Ulster government to be reduced to six counties so that it would have a larger Protestant unionist majority, which they believed would guarantee its longevity. The six counties of Antrim, Down, Armagh, Londonderry, Tyrone and Fermanagh comprised the maximum area unionists believed they could dominate,[51] The area that was to become Northern Ireland included counties Fermanagh and Tyrone, even though they had nationalist majorities in the 1918 Irish general election.[52]  Events overtook the government. In the 1918 Irish general election, the pro-independence Sinn F\u00e9in party won the overwhelming majority of Irish seats. Sinn F\u00e9in's elected members boycotted the British parliament and founded a separate Irish parliament (D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann), declaring an independent Irish Republic covering the whole island. Many Irish republicans blamed the British establishment for the sectarian divisions in Ireland, and believed that Ulster unionism would fade once British rule was ended.[53] The British authorities outlawed the D\u00e1il in September 1919,[54] and a guerrilla conflict developed as the Irish Republican Army (IRA) began attacking British forces. This became known as the Irish War of Independence.[55]  Meanwhile, the Government of Ireland Act 1920 passed through the British parliament in 1920. It would divide Ireland into two self-governing UK territories: the six northeastern counties (Northern Ireland) being ruled from Belfast, and the other twenty-six counties (Southern Ireland) being ruled from Dublin. Both would have a shared Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, who would appoint both governments and a Council of Ireland, which the UK government intended to evolve into an all-Ireland parliament.[56] The Act received royal assent that December, becoming the Government of Ireland Act 1920. It came into force on 3 May 1921,[57][58] partitioning Ireland and creating Northern Ireland. the 1921 Irish elections were held on 24 May, in which unionists won most seats in the Northern Ireland parliament. It first met on 7 June and formed its first devolved government, headed by Ulster Unionist Party leader James Craig. Irish nationalist members refused to attend. King George V addressed the ceremonial opening of the Northern parliament on 22 June.[57]  During 1920\u201322, in what became Northern Ireland, partition was accompanied by violence \"in defence or opposition to the new settlement\"[24] during The Troubles (1920\u20131922). The IRA carried out attacks on British forces in the north-east but was less active than in the rest of Ireland. Protestant loyalists attacked Catholics in reprisal for IRA actions. In the summer of 1920, sectarian violence erupted in Belfast and Derry, and there were mass burnings of Catholic property in Lisburn and Banbridge.[59] Conflict continued intermittently for two years, mostly in Belfast, which saw \"savage and unprecedented\" communal violence between Protestants and Catholics, including rioting, gun battles, and bombings. Homes, businesses, and churches were attacked and people were expelled from workplaces and mixed neighbourhoods.[24] More than 500 were killed[25] and more than 10,000 became refugees, most of them Catholics.[60] The British Army was deployed and the Ulster Special Constabulary (USC) was formed to help the regular police. The USC was almost wholly Protestant. Members of the USC and regular police were involved in reprisal attacks on Catholic civilians.[61] A truce between British forces and the IRA was established on 11 July 1921, ending the fighting in most of Ireland. However, communal violence continued in Belfast, and in 1922 the IRA launched a guerrilla offensive along the new Irish border.[62]  The Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed between representatives of the governments of the UK and the Irish Republic on 6 December 1921, creating the Irish Free State. Under the terms of the treaty, Northern Ireland would become part of the Free State unless its government opted out by presenting an address to the king, although in practice partition remained in place.[63]   As expected, the Parliament of Northern Ireland resolved on 7 December 1922 (the day after the establishment of the Irish Free State) to exercise its right to opt out of the Free State by making an address to King George V.[64] The text of the address was:  Most Gracious Sovereign, We, your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Senators and Commons of Northern Ireland in Parliament assembled, having learnt of the passing of the Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922, being the Act of Parliament for the ratification of the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland, do, by this humble Address, pray your Majesty that the powers of the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State shall no longer extend to Northern Ireland.[65]  Shortly afterwards, the Irish Boundary Commission was established to decide on the border between the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland. Owing to the outbreak of the Irish Civil War, the work of the commission was delayed until 1925. The Free State government and Irish nationalists hoped for a large transfer of territory to the Free State, as many border areas had nationalist majorities. Many believed this would leave the remaining Northern Ireland territory too small to be viable.[66] However, the commission's final report recommended only small transfers of territory, and in both directions. The Free State, Northern Ireland, and UK governments agreed to suppress the report and accept the status quo, while the UK government agreed that the Free State would no longer have to pay a share of the UK national debt.[67]  Northern Ireland's border was drawn to give it \"a decisive Protestant majority\". At the time of its creation, Northern Ireland's population was two-thirds Protestant and one-third Catholic.[21] Most Protestants were unionists\/loyalists who sought to maintain Northern Ireland as a part of the United Kingdom, while most Catholics were Irish nationalists\/republicans who sought an independent United Ireland. There was mutual self-imposed segregation in Northern Ireland between Protestants and Catholics such as in education, housing, and often employment.[68]  For its first fifty years, Northern Ireland had an unbroken series of Ulster Unionist Party governments.[69] Every prime minister and almost every minister of these governments were members of the Orange Order, as were all but 11 of the 149 Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) MPs elected during this time.[70] Almost all judges and magistrates were Protestant, many of them closely associated with the UUP. Northern Ireland's new police force was the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), which succeeded the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC). It too was almost wholly Protestant and lacked operational independence, responding to directions from government ministers. The RUC and the reserve Ulster Special Constabulary (USC) were militarized police forces due to the perceived threat of militant republicanism. In 1936 the British advocacy group - the National Council for Civil Liberties characterised the USC as \"nothing but the organised army of the Unionist party\".[71] They \"had at their disposal the Special Powers Act, a sweeping piece of legislation which allowed arrests without warrant, internment without trial, unlimited search powers, and bans on meetings and publications\".[72] This 1922 Act was made permanent in 1933 and was not repealed until 1973.[73]  The Nationalist Party was the main political party in opposition to the UUP governments. However, its elected members often protested by abstaining from the Northern Ireland parliament, and many nationalists did not vote in parliamentary elections.[68] Other early nationalist groups which campaigned against partition included the National League of the North (formed in 1928), the Northern Council for Unity (formed in 1937) and the Irish Anti-Partition League (formed in 1945).[74]  The Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) of 1922 allowed for the altering of municipal and rural boundaries. This Act led to the gerrymandering of election boundaries in the Nationalists majority cities of Derry City, Enniskillen, Omagh, Armagh and many other towns and rural districts. That action ensured Unionist control over local councils in areas where they were a minority.[75] The UUP governments, and some UUP-dominated local authorities, discriminated against the Catholic and Irish nationalist minority; especially by the gerrymandering of electoral boundaries, the allocation of public housing, public sector employment, and policing, showing \"a consistent and irrefutable pattern of deliberate discrimination against Catholics\".[76] Many Catholics\/Nationalists saw the gerrymandered electoral boundaries and the abolishing of proportional representation as proof of government-sponsored discrimination. Until 1969 a system was in place called plural voting which was a practice whereby one person might be able to vote multiple times in an election. Property and business owners could vote both in the constituency where their property lay and that in which they lived, if the two were different. This system often resulted in one person being able to cast multiple votes.[77] Decades later, UUP First Minister of Northern Ireland, David Trimble, said that Northern Ireland under the UUP had been a \"cold house\" for Catholics.[78]  During World War II, recruitment to the British military was noticeably lower than the high levels reached during World War I. In June 1940, to encourage the neutral Irish state to join with the Allies, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill indicated to Taoiseach \u00c9amon de Valera that the British government would encourage Irish unity, but believing that Churchill could not deliver, de Valera declined the offer.[79] The British did not inform the government of Northern Ireland that they had made the offer to the Dublin government, and de Valera's rejection was not publicised until 1970. Belfast was a key industrial city in the UK's war effort, producing ships, tanks, aircraft, and munitions. The unemployment that had been so persistent in the 1930s disappeared, and labour shortages appeared, prompting migration from the Free State. The city was thinly defended, and had only 24 anti-aircraft guns. Richard Dawson Bates, the Minister for Home Affairs, had prepared too late, assuming that Belfast was far enough away to be safe. The city's fire brigade was inadequate, and as the Northern Ireland government had been reluctant to spend money on air raid shelters, it only started to build them after the Blitz in London during the autumn of 1940. There were no searchlights in the city, which made shooting down enemy bombers more difficult. In April\u2013May 1941, the Belfast Blitz began when the Luftwaffe launched a series of raids that were the most deadly seen outside London. Working-class areas in the north and east of the city were particularly hard hit, and over 1,000 people were killed and hundreds were seriously injured. Tens of thousands of people fled the city in fear of future attacks. In the final raid, Luftwaffe bombs inflicted extensive damage to the docks and the Harland & Wolff shipyard, closing it for six months. Half of the city's houses had been destroyed, highlighting the terrible slum conditions in Belfast, and about \u00a320 million worth of damage was caused. The Northern Ireland government was criticised heavily for its lack of preparation, and Northern Ireland Prime Minister J. M. Andrews resigned. There was a major munitions strike in 1944.[80]  The Ireland Act 1949 gave the first legal guarantee that the region would not cease to be part of the United Kingdom without the consent of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.  From 1956 to 1962, the Irish Republican Army (IRA) carried out a limited guerrilla campaign in border areas of Northern Ireland, called the Border Campaign. It aimed to destabilize Northern Ireland and bring about an end to partition but failed.[81]  In 1965, Northern Ireland's Prime Minister Terence O'Neill met the Taoiseach, Se\u00e1n Lemass. It was the first meeting between the two heads of government since partition.[82]  The Troubles, which started in the late 1960s, consisted of about 30 years of recurring acts of intense violence during which 3,254 people were killed[83] with over 50,000 casualties.[84] From 1969 to 2003 there were over 36,900 shooting incidents and over 16,200 bombings or attempted bombings associated with The Troubles.[32] The conflict was caused by escalating tensions between the Irish nationalist minority and the dominant unionist majority; Irish nationalists object to Northern Ireland staying within the United Kingdom.[85] From 1967 to 1972 the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA), which modelled itself on the US civil rights movement, led a campaign of civil resistance to anti-Catholic discrimination in housing, employment, policing, and electoral procedures. The franchise for local government elections included only rate-payers and their spouses, and so excluded over a quarter of the electorate. While the majority of disenfranchised electors were Protestant, Catholics were over-represented since they were poorer and had more adults still living in the family home.[86]  NICRA's campaign, seen by many unionists as an Irish republican front, and the violent reaction to it proved to be a precursor to a more violent period.[87] As early as 1969, armed campaigns of paramilitary groups began, including the Provisional IRA campaign of 1969\u20131997 which was aimed at the end of British rule in Northern Ireland and the creation of a United Ireland, and the Ulster Volunteer Force, formed in 1966 in response to the perceived erosion of both the British character and unionist domination of Northern Ireland. The state security forces \u2013 the British Army and the police (the Royal Ulster Constabulary) \u2013 were also involved in the violence. The UK Government's position is that its forces were neutral in the conflict, trying to uphold law and order in Northern Ireland and the right of the people of Northern Ireland to democratic self-determination. Republicans regarded the state forces as combatants in the conflict, pointing to the collusion between the state forces and the loyalist paramilitaries as proof of this. The \"Ballast\" investigation by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland has confirmed that British forces, and in particular the RUC, did collude with loyalist paramilitaries, were involved in murder, and did obstruct the course of justice when such claims had been investigated,[88] although the extent to which such collusion occurred is still disputed.  As a consequence of the worsening security situation, the autonomous regional government for Northern Ireland was suspended in 1972. Alongside the violence, there was a political deadlock between the major political parties in Northern Ireland, including those who condemned the violence, over the future status of Northern Ireland and the form of government there should be within Northern Ireland. In 1973, Northern Ireland held a referendum to determine if it should remain in the United Kingdom, or be part of a united Ireland. The vote went heavily in favour (98.9%) of maintaining the status quo. Approximately 57.5% of the total electorate voted in support, but only 1% of Catholics voted following a boycott organised by the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP).[89]  The Troubles were brought to an uneasy end by a peace process that included the declaration of ceasefires by most paramilitary organisations and the complete decommissioning of their weapons, the reform of the police, and the corresponding withdrawal of army troops from the streets and sensitive border areas such as South Armagh and Fermanagh, as agreed by the signatories to the Belfast Agreement (commonly known as the \"Good Friday Agreement\"). This reiterated the long-held British position, which had never before been fully acknowledged by successive Irish governments, that Northern Ireland will remain within the United Kingdom until a majority of voters in Northern Ireland decides otherwise. The Constitution of Ireland was amended in 1999 to remove a claim of the \"Irish nation\" to sovereignty over the entire island (in Article 2).[90]  The new Articles 2 and 3, added to the Constitution to replace the earlier articles, implicitly acknowledge that the status of Northern Ireland, and its relationships within the rest of the United Kingdom and with the Republic of Ireland, would only be changed with the agreement of a majority of voters in each jurisdiction. This aspect was also central to the Belfast Agreement which was signed in 1998 and ratified by referendums held simultaneously in both Northern Ireland and the Republic. At the same time, the UK Government recognised for the first time, as part of the prospective, the so-called \"Irish dimension\": the principle that the people of the island of Ireland as a whole have the right, without any outside interference, to solve the issues between North and South by mutual consent.[91] The latter statement was key to winning support for the agreement from nationalists. It established a devolved power-sharing government, the Northern Ireland Assembly, located on the Stormont Estate, which must consist of both unionist and nationalist parties. These institutions were suspended by the UK Government in 2002 after Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) allegations of spying by people working for Sinn F\u00e9in at the Assembly (Stormontgate). The resulting case against the accused Sinn F\u00e9in member collapsed.[92]  On 28 July 2005, the Provisional IRA declared an end to its campaign and has since decommissioned what is thought to be all of its arsenal. This final act of decommissioning was performed under the watch of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD) and two external church witnesses. Many unionists, however, remained sceptical. The IICD later confirmed that the main loyalist paramilitary groups, the Ulster Defence Association, UVF, and the Red Hand Commando, had decommissioned what is thought to be all of their arsenals, witnessed by former archbishop Robin Eames and a former top civil servant.[93]  Politicians elected to the Assembly at the 2003 Assembly election were called together on 15 May 2006 under the Northern Ireland Act 2006[94] to elect a First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland and choose the members of an Executive (before 25 November 2006) as a preliminary step to the restoration of devolved government.  Following the election on 7 March 2007, the devolved government returned on 8 May 2007 with Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Ian Paisley and Sinn F\u00e9in deputy leader Martin McGuinness taking office as First Minister and deputy First Minister, respectively.[95] In its white paper on Brexit the United Kingdom government reiterated its commitment to the Belfast Agreement. Concerning Northern Ireland's status, it said that the UK Government's \"clearly-stated preference is to retain Northern Ireland's current constitutional position: as part of the UK, but with strong links to Ireland\".[96]  On 3 February 2022, Paul Givan resigned as first minister, which automatically resigned Michelle O'Neill as deputy first minister and collapsed the executive of Northern Ireland.[97] On 30 January 2024, leader of the DUP Jeffrey Donaldson announced that the DUP would restore an executive government on the condition that new legislation was passed by the UK House of Commons.[98]  The main political divide in Northern Ireland is between unionists, who wish to see Northern Ireland continue as part of the United Kingdom, and nationalists, who wish to see Northern Ireland unified with the Republic of Ireland, independent from the United Kingdom. These two opposing views are linked to deeper cultural divisions. Unionists are predominantly Ulster Protestant, descendants of mainly Scottish, English, and Huguenot settlers as well as Gaels who converted to one of the Protestant denominations. Nationalists are overwhelmingly Catholic and descend from the population predating the settlement, with a minority from the Scottish Highlands as well as some converts from Protestantism. Discrimination against nationalists under the Stormont government (1921\u20131972) gave rise to the civil rights movement in the 1960s.[99]  While some unionists argue that discrimination was not just due to religious or political bigotry, but also the result of more complex socio-economic, socio-political and geographical factors,[100] its existence, and the manner in which nationalist anger at it was handled, were a major contributing factor to the Troubles. The political unrest went through its most violent phase between 1968 and 1994.[101]  In 2007, 36% of the population defined themselves as unionist, 24% as nationalist, and 40% defined themselves as neither.[102] According to a 2015 opinion poll, 70% express a long-term preference of the maintenance of Northern Ireland's membership of the United Kingdom (either directly ruled or with devolved government), while 14% express a preference for membership of a united Ireland.[103] This discrepancy can be explained by the overwhelming preference among Protestants to remain a part of the UK (93%), while Catholic preferences are spread across several solutions to the constitutional question including remaining a part of the UK (47%), a united Ireland (32%), Northern Ireland becoming an independent state (4%), and those who \"don't know\" (16%).[104]  Official voting figures, which reflect views on the \"national question\" along with issues of the candidate, geography, personal loyalty, and historic voting patterns, show 54% of Northern Ireland voters vote for unionist parties, 42% vote for nationalist parties, and 4% vote \"other\". Opinion polls consistently show that the election results are not necessarily an indication of the electorate's stance regarding the constitutional status of Northern Ireland. Most of the population of Northern Ireland is at least nominally Christian, mostly Roman Catholic and Protestant denominations. Many voters (regardless of religious affiliation) are attracted to unionism's conservative policies, while other voters are instead attracted to the traditionally leftist Sinn F\u00e9in and SDLP and their respective party platforms for democratic socialism and social democracy.[105]  For the most part, Protestants feel a strong connection with Great Britain and wish for Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom. Many Catholics however, generally aspire to a United Ireland or are less certain about how to solve the constitutional question. Catholics have a slight majority in Northern Ireland, according to the latest Northern Ireland census. The make-up of the Northern Ireland Assembly reflects the appeals of the various parties within the population. Of the 90\u00a0Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs), 37 are unionists and 35 are nationalists (the remaining 18 are classified as \"other\").[106]  The 1998 Good Friday Agreement acts as a de facto constitution for Northern Ireland. Local government in Northern Ireland since 2015 has been divided between 11 councils with limited responsibilities.[107] The First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland are the joint heads of government of Northern Ireland.[108][109]  Since 1998, Northern Ireland has had devolved government within the United Kingdom, presided over by the Northern Ireland Assembly and a cross-community government (the Northern Ireland Executive). The UK Government and UK Parliament are responsible for reserved and excepted matters. Reserved matters comprise listed policy areas (such as civil aviation, units of measurement, and human genetics) that Parliament may devolve to the Assembly some time in the future. Excepted matters (such as international relations, taxation and elections) are never expected to be considered for devolution. On all other governmental matters, the Executive together with the 90-member Assembly may legislate for and govern Northern Ireland. Devolution in Northern Ireland is dependent upon participation by members of the Northern Ireland executive in the North\/South Ministerial Council, which coordinates areas of cooperation (such as agriculture, education, and health) between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Additionally, \"in recognition of the Irish Government's special interest in Northern Ireland\", the Government of Ireland and Government of the United Kingdom co-operate closely on non-devolved matters through the British\u2013Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  Elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly are by single transferable vote with five Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) elected from each of 18 parliamentary constituencies. In addition, eighteen representatives (Members of Parliament, MPs) are elected to the lower house of the UK parliament from the same constituencies using the first-past-the-post system. However, not all of those elected take their seats. Sinn F\u00e9in MPs, currently seven, refuse to take the oath to serve the King that is required before MPs are allowed to take their seats. In addition, the upper house of the UK parliament, the House of Lords, currently has some 25 appointed members from Northern Ireland.  The Northern Ireland Office represents the UK Government in Northern Ireland on reserved matters and represents Northern Ireland's interests within the UK Government. Additionally, the Republic's government also has the right to \"put forward views and proposals\" on non-devolved matters about Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Office is led by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, who sits in the Cabinet of the United Kingdom.  Northern Ireland is a distinct legal jurisdiction, separate from the two other jurisdictions in the United Kingdom (England and Wales, and Scotland). Northern Ireland law developed from Irish law that existed before the partition of Ireland in 1921. Northern Ireland is a common law jurisdiction and its common law is similar to that in England and Wales. However, there are important differences in law and procedure between Northern Ireland and England and Wales. The body of statute law affecting Northern Ireland reflects the history of Northern Ireland, including Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the Northern Ireland Assembly, the former Parliament of Northern Ireland and the Parliament of Ireland, along with some Acts of the Parliament of England and of the Parliament of Great Britain that were extended to Ireland under Poynings' Law between 1494 and 1782.  There is no generally accepted term to describe what Northern Ireland is: province, region, country or something else. The choice of term can be controversial and can reveal the writer's political preferences.[17] This has been noted as a problem by several writers on Northern Ireland, with no generally recommended solution.[16][17][18]  ISO 3166-2:GB defines Northern Ireland as a province.[15] The UK's submission to the 2007 United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names defines the UK as being made up of two countries (England and Scotland), one principality (Wales) and one province (Northern Ireland).[110] However, this term can be controversial, particularly for nationalists for whom the title province is properly reserved for the traditional province of Ulster, of which Northern Ireland comprises six out of nine counties.[111][17][112] Some authors have described the meaning of this term as being equivocal: referring to Northern Ireland as being a province both of the United Kingdom and the traditional country of Ireland.[113]  The UK Office for National Statistics and the website of the Office of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom describe the United Kingdom as being made up of four countries, one of these being Northern Ireland.[14][114] Some newspaper style guides also consider country as an acceptable term for Northern Ireland.[111] However, some authors reject the term.[112][16][18][113]  \"Region\" has also been used by UK government agencies[115] and newspapers.[111] Some authors choose this word but note that it is \"unsatisfactory\".[17][18] Northern Ireland can also be simply described as \"part of the UK\", including by the UK government offices.[114]  Many people inside and outside Northern Ireland use other names for Northern Ireland, depending on their point of view. Disagreement on names, and the reading of political symbolism into the use or non-use of a word, also attaches itself to some urban centres. The most notable example is whether Northern Ireland's second-largest city should be called \"Derry\" or \"Londonderry\".  Choice of language and nomenclature in Northern Ireland often reveals the cultural, ethnic, and religious identity of the speaker. Those who do not belong to any group but lean towards one side often tend to use the language of that group. Supporters of unionism in the British media (notably The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Express) regularly call Northern Ireland \"Ulster\".[116] Many media outlets in the Republic use \"North of Ireland\" (or simply \"the North\"),[117][118][119][120][121] as well as the \"Six Counties\".[122] The New York Times has also used \"the North\".[123]  Government and cultural organisations in Northern Ireland often use the word \"Ulster\" in their title; for example, the University of Ulster, the Ulster Museum, the Ulster Orchestra, and BBC Radio Ulster.  Although some news bulletins since the 1990s have opted to avoid all contentious terms and use the official name, Northern Ireland, the term \"the North\" remains commonly used by broadcast media in the Republic.[117][118][119]  The volcanic activity which created the Antrim Plateau also formed the geometric pillars of the Giant's Causeway on the north Antrim coast. Also in north Antrim are the Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge, Mussenden Temple and the Glens of Antrim. Northern Ireland was covered by an ice sheet for most of the last ice age and on numerous previous occasions, the legacy of which can be seen in the extensive coverage of drumlins in Counties Fermanagh, Armagh, Antrim and particularly Down.  The centrepiece of Northern Ireland's geography is Lough Neagh, at 151 square miles (391\u00a0km2) the largest freshwater lake both on the island of Ireland and in the British Isles. A second extensive lake system is centred on Lower and Upper Lough Erne in Fermanagh. The largest island of Northern Ireland is Rathlin, off the north Antrim coast. Strangford Lough is the largest inlet in the British Isles, covering 150\u00a0km2 (58\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).  There are substantial uplands in the Sperrin Mountains (an extension of the Caledonian mountain belt) with extensive gold deposits, the granite Mourne Mountains and the basalt Antrim Plateau, as well as smaller ranges in South Armagh and along the Fermanagh\u2013Tyrone border. None of the hills are especially high, with Slieve Donard in the dramatic Mournes reaching 850 metres (2,789\u00a0ft), Northern Ireland's highest point. Belfast's most prominent peak is Cavehill.  The Lower and Upper River Bann, River Foyle and River Blackwater form extensive fertile lowlands, with excellent arable land also found in North and East Down, although much of the hill country is marginal and suitable largely for animal husbandry. The valley of the River Lagan is dominated by Belfast, whose metropolitan area includes over a third of the population of Northern Ireland, with heavy urbanisation and industrialisation along the Lagan Valley and both shores of Belfast Lough.  The vast majority of Northern Ireland has a temperate maritime climate, (Cfb in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification) rather wetter in the west than the east, although cloud cover is very common across the region. The weather is unpredictable at all times of the year, and although the seasons are distinct, they are considerably less pronounced than in interior Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America. Average daytime maximums in Belfast are 6.5\u00a0\u00b0C (43.7\u00a0\u00b0F) in January and 17.5\u00a0\u00b0C (63.5\u00a0\u00b0F) in July. The highest maximum temperature recorded was 31.4\u00a0\u00b0C (88.5\u00a0\u00b0F), registered in July 2021 at Armagh Observatory's weather station.[134] The lowest minimum temperature recorded was \u221218.7\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22121.7\u00a0\u00b0F) at Castlederg, County Tyrone on 23 December 2010.[135]  Until the end of the Middle Ages, the land was heavily forested. Native species include deciduous trees such as oak, ash, hazel, birch, alder, willow, aspen, elm, rowan and hawthorn, as well as evergreen trees such Scots pine, yew and holly.[136] Today, only 8% of Northern Ireland is woodland, and most of this is non-native conifer plantations.[137]  As of the 21st century, Northern Ireland is the least forested part of the United Kingdom and Ireland, and one of the least forested countries in Europe.[138]  The only native reptile in Northern Ireland is the viviparous lizard, or common lizard, which is widely distributed, particularly in heaths, bogs and sand dunes. The common frog is a very widespread species.\u00a0Some lakes support internationally important bird populations, Lough Neagh and Lough Beg hold up to 80,000 wintering waterfowl of some 20 species, including ducks, geese, swans and gulls. The otter is the fourth largest land mammal in Northern Ireland. It can be found along the river systems, although it is seldom seen and will avoid contact with humans.[139] 356 species of marine algae have been recorded in the northeast of Ireland; 77 species are considered rare.[140]  Northern Ireland consists of six historic counties: County Antrim, County Armagh, County Down, County Fermanagh, County Londonderry,[e] and County Tyrone.  These counties are no longer used for local government purposes; instead, there are eleven districts of Northern Ireland which have different geographical extents. These were created in 2015, replacing the twenty-six districts which previously existed.[141]  Although counties are no longer used for local governmental purposes, they remain a popular means of describing where places are. They are officially used while applying for an Irish passport, which requires one to state one's county of birth. The name of that county then appears in both Irish and English on the passport's information page, as opposed to the town or city of birth on the United Kingdom passport. The Gaelic Athletic Association still uses the counties as its primary means of organisation and fields representative teams of each GAA county. The original system of car registration numbers largely based on counties remains in use. In 2000, the telephone numbering system was restructured into an 8-digit scheme with (except for Belfast) the first digit approximately reflecting the county.  The county boundaries still appear on Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland Maps and the Philip's Street Atlases, among others. With their decline in official use, there is often confusion surrounding towns and cities which lie near county boundaries, such as Belfast and Lisburn, which are split between counties Down and Antrim (the majorities of both cities, however, are in Antrim).  In March 2018, The Sunday Times published its list of Best Places to Live in Britain, including the following places in Northern Ireland: Ballyhackamore near Belfast (overall best for Northern Ireland), Holywood, County Down, Newcastle, County Down, Portrush, County Antrim, Strangford, County Down.[142]  The population of Northern Ireland has risen yearly since 1978. The population at the time of the 2021 census was 1.9\u00a0million, having grown 5% over the previous decade.[145] The population in 2011 was 1.8\u00a0million, a rise of 7.5% over the previous decade.[146] The current population makes up 2.8% of the UK's population (67\u00a0million) and 27% of the island of Ireland's population (7.03\u00a0million). The population density is 135 inhabitants \/ km2.  As of the 2021 census, the population of Northern Ireland is almost entirely white (96.6%).[147] In 2021, 86.5% of the population were born in Northern Ireland, with 4.8% born in Great Britain, 2.1% born in the Republic of Ireland, and 6.5% born elsewhere (more than half of them in another European country).[148] In 2021 the largest non-white ethnic groups were black (0.6%), Indian (0.5%), and Chinese (0.5%).[147] In 2011, 88.8% of the population were born in Northern Ireland, 4.5% in Great Britain, and 2.9% in the Republic of Ireland. 4.3% were born elsewhere; triple the amount there were in 2001.[149]  In Northern Ireland censuses, respondents can choose more than one national identity. In 2021:[153]  The main national identities given in recent censuses were:  As of the 2021 census, regarding national identity, four of the six traditional counties had an Irish plurality and two had a British plurality.[155][156][157][158]  At the 2021 census, 42.3% of the population identified as Roman Catholic, 37.3% as Protestant\/other Christian, 1.3% as other religions, while 17.4% identified with no religion or did not state one.[159] The biggest of the Protestant\/other Christian denominations were the Presbyterian Church (16.6%), the Church of Ireland (11.5%) and the Methodist Church (2.3%).[159] At the 2011 census, 41.5% of the population identified as Protestant\/other Christian, 41% as Roman Catholic, 0.8% as other religions, while 17% identified with no religion or did not state one.[160] In terms of background (i.e. religion or religion brought up in), at the 2021 census 45.7% of the population came from a Catholic background, 43.5% from a Protestant background, 1.5% from other religious backgrounds, and 5.6% from non-religious backgrounds.[159] This was the first time since Northern Ireland's creation that there were more people from a Catholic background than Protestant.[161] At the 2011 census, 48% came from a Protestant background, 45% from a Catholic background, 0.9% from other religious backgrounds, and 5.6% from non-religious backgrounds.[160]  In recent censuses, respondents gave their religious identity or religious upbringing as follows:[162][154][159]  As of the 2021 census, regarding religious background, four of the six traditional counties had a Catholic majority, one had a Protestant plurality, and one had a Protestant majority.[163]  Several studies and surveys carried out between 1971 and 2006 have indicated that, in general, most Protestants in Northern Ireland see themselves primarily as British, whereas most Catholics see themselves primarily as Irish.[164][165][166][167][168][169][170][171] This does not, however, account for the complex identities within Northern Ireland, given that many of the population regard themselves as \"Ulster\" or \"Northern Irish\", either as a primary or secondary identity.  A 2008 survey found that 57% of Protestants described themselves as British, while 32% identified as Northern Irish, 6% as Ulster, and 4% as Irish. Compared to a similar survey in 1998, this shows a fall in the percentage of Protestants identifying as British and Ulster and a rise in those identifying as Northern Irish. The 2008 survey found that 61% of Catholics described themselves as Irish, with 25% identifying as Northern Irish, 8% as British, and 1% as Ulster. These figures were largely unchanged from the 1998 results.[172][173]  People born in Northern Ireland are, with some exceptions, deemed by UK law to be citizens of the United Kingdom. They are also, with similar exceptions, entitled to be citizens of Ireland. This entitlement was reaffirmed in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement between the British and Irish governments, which provides that:  ...it is the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose, and accordingly [the two governments] confirm that their right to hold both British and Irish citizenship is accepted by both Governments and would not be affected by any future change in the status of Northern Ireland. As a result of the Agreement, the Constitution of the Republic of Ireland was amended. The current wording provides that people born in Northern Ireland are entitled to be Irish citizens on the same basis as people from any other part of the island.[174]  Neither government, however, extends its citizenship to all persons born in Northern Ireland. Both governments exclude some people born in Northern Ireland, in particular persons born without one parent who is a British or Irish citizen. The Irish restriction was given effect by the twenty-seventh amendment to the Irish Constitution in 2004. The position in UK nationality law is that most of those born in Northern Ireland are UK nationals, whether or not they so choose. Renunciation of British citizenship requires the payment of a fee, currently \u00a3372.[175]  In recent censuses, residents said they held the following passports:[154][176]  Irish is an official language of Northern Ireland as of 6 December 2022 when the Irish Language Act (Identity and Language (Northern Ireland) Act 2022) became law. The Irish Language Act officially repealed legislation from 1737 that banned the use of Irish in courts.[1] English is a de facto official language.[citation needed] English is also spoken as a first language by 95.4% of the Northern Ireland population.[177]  Under the Good Friday Agreement, Irish and Ulster Scots (an Ulster dialect of the Scots language, sometimes known as Ullans), are recognised as \"part of the cultural wealth of Northern Ireland\".[178] The Irish Language Act of 2022 also legislated commissioners for both Irish and Ulster Scots.[1]  Two all-island bodies for the promotion of these were created under the Agreement: Foras na Gaeilge, which promotes the Irish language, and the Ulster Scots Agency, which promotes the Ulster-Scots dialect and culture. These operate separately under the aegis of the North\/South Language Body, which reports to the North\/South Ministerial Council.  The UK Government in 2001 ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Irish (in Northern Ireland) was specified under Part III of the Charter, with a range of specific undertakings about education, translation of statutes, interaction with public authorities, the use of placenames, media access, support for cultural activities, and other matters. A lower level of recognition was accorded to Ulster-Scots, under Part II of the Charter.[179]  According to the 2021 census, in 94.74% of households, all people aged 16 and above spoke English as their main language.[180] The dialect of English spoken in Northern Ireland shows influence from the lowland Scots language.[181] There are supposedly some minute differences in pronunciation between Protestants and Catholics, for instance; the name of the letter h, which Protestants tend to pronounce as \"aitch\", as in British English, and Catholics tend to pronounce as \"haitch\", as in Hiberno-English.[182] However, geography is a much more important determinant of dialect than religious background.  The Irish language (Irish: an Ghaeilge), or Gaelic, is the second most spoken language in Northern Ireland and is a native language of Ireland.[183] It was spoken predominantly throughout what is now Northern Ireland before the Ulster Plantations in the 17th century and most place names in Northern Ireland are anglicised versions of a Gaelic name. Today, the language is often associated with Irish nationalism (and thus with Catholics). However, in the 19th century, the language was seen as a common heritage, with Ulster Protestants playing a leading role in the Gaelic revival.[184]  In the 2021 census, 12.4% (compared with 10.7% in 2011) of the population of Northern Ireland claimed \"some knowledge of Irish\" and 3.9% (compared with 3.7% in 2011) reported being able to \"speak, read, write and understand\" Irish.[146][177] In another survey, from 1999, 1% of respondents said they spoke it as their main language at home.[185]  The dialect spoken in Northern Ireland, Ulster Irish, has two main types, East Ulster Irish and Donegal Irish (or West Ulster Irish),[186] is the one closest to Scottish Gaelic (which developed into a separate language from Irish Gaelic in the 17th century). Some words and phrases are shared with Scots Gaelic, and the dialects of east Ulster \u2013 those of Rathlin Island and the Glens of Antrim \u2013 were very similar to the dialect of Argyll, the part of Scotland nearest to Ireland. The dialects of Armagh and Down were also very similar to the dialects of Galloway.  The use of the Irish language in Northern Ireland today is politically sensitive. The erection by some district councils of bilingual street names in both English and Irish,[187] invariably in predominantly nationalist districts, is resisted by unionists who claim that it creates a \"chill factor\" and thus harms community relationships. Efforts by members of the Northern Ireland Assembly to legislate for some official uses of the language have failed to achieve the required cross-community support. In May 2022, the UK Government proposed a bill in the House of Lords to make Irish an official language (and support Ulster Scots) in Northern Ireland and to create an Irish Language Commissioner.[188][189] The bill has since been passed, and received royal assent in December 2022.[190] There has recently been an increase in interest in the language among unionists in East Belfast.[191]  Ulster Scots comprises varieties of the Scots language spoken in Northern Ireland. For a native English speaker, \"[Ulster Scots] is comparatively accessible, and even at its most intense can be understood fairly easily with the help of a glossary.\"[192]  Along with the Irish language, the Good Friday Agreement recognised the dialect as part of Northern Ireland's unique culture and the St Andrews Agreement recognised the need to \"enhance and develop the Ulster Scots language, heritage and culture\".[193]  At the time of the 2021 census, approximately 1.1% (compared to 0.9% in 2011) of the population claimed to be able to speak, read, write and understand Ulster-Scots, while 10.4% (compared to 8.1% in 2011) professed to have \"some ability\".[146][177][185]  The most common sign language in Northern Ireland is Northern Ireland Sign Language (NISL). However, because in the past Catholic families tended to send their deaf children to schools in Dublin[citation needed] where Irish Sign Language (ISL) is commonly used, ISL is still common among many older deaf people from Catholic families.  Irish Sign Language (ISL) has some influence from the French family of sign language, which includes American Sign Language (ASL). NISL takes a large component from the British family of sign language (which also includes Auslan) with many borrowings from ASL. It is described as being related to Irish Sign Language at the syntactic level while much of the lexicon is based on British Sign Language (BSL).[194]  As of March\u00a02004[update] the UK Government recognises only British Sign Language and Irish Sign Language as the official sign languages used in Northern Ireland.[195][196]  Unlike most areas of the United Kingdom, in the last year of primary school, many children sit entrance examinations for grammar schools. Integrated schools, which attempt to ensure a balance in enrolment between pupils of Protestant, Roman Catholic, and other faiths (or none), are becoming increasingly popular, although Northern Ireland still has a primarily de facto religiously segregated education system. In the primary school sector, 40 schools (8.9% of the total number) are integrated schools and 32 (7.2% of the total number) are Gaelscoileanna (Irish language-medium schools).  As with the island of Ireland as a whole, Northern Ireland has one of the youngest populations in Europe and, among the four UK nations, it has the highest proportion of children aged under 16 years (21% in mid-2019).[197]  In the most recent full academic year (2021\u20132022), the region's school education system comprised 1,124 schools (of all types) and around 346,000 pupils, including:  Enrolments in further and higher education were as follows (in 2019\u20132020) before disruption to enrolments and classes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic:  Statistics on education in Northern Ireland are published by the Department of Education and the Department for the Economy.  The main universities in Northern Ireland are Queen's University Belfast and Ulster University, and the distance learning Open University which has a regional office in Belfast.  Since 1948 Northern Ireland has a health care system similar to England, Scotland and Wales, though it provides not only health care, but also social care. Health care performance has been decreasing since the mid-2010s and reached crisis levels since 2022.[202]  Northern Ireland traditionally had an industrial economy, most notably featuring shipbuilding, rope manufacture, and textiles. In 2019, 53% of GVA was generated by services, 22% by the public sector, 15% by production, 8% by construction and 2% by agriculture.[203]  Belfast is the United Kingdom's second largest tech hub outside of London with more than 25% of their jobs being technology related. Many established multinational tech companies such as Fujitsu, SAP, IBM and Microsoft have a presence here. It is regarded an appealing place to live for tech professionals and has a low cost of living compared to other cities.[204][205]  In 2019 Northern Ireland welcomed 5.3m visitors, who spent over \u00a31billion. A total of 167 cruise ships docked at Northern Ireland ports in 2019.[206] Tourism in recent years has been a major growth area with key attractions including the Giants Causeway and the many castles in the region with the historic towns and cities of Belfast, Derry, Armagh and Enniskillen being popular with tourists. Entertainment venues include the SSE Arena, Waterfront Hall, the Grand Opera House and Custom House Square. Tourists use various means of transport around Northern Ireland such as vehicle hire, guided tours, taxi tours, electric bikes, electric cars and public transport.[207]  Belfast currently has an 81-acre shipyard which was purposely developed to be able to take some of the world's largest vessels. It has the largest dry dock for ships in Europe measuring 556m x 93m and has 106m high cranes, it is ideally situated between the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea.[208] The shipyard can build ships and complete maintenance contracts such as the contracts awarded by P&O and Cunard cruise ships in 2022.[209]  Northern Ireland feeds around 10 million people when their population is only 1.8 million.[210] The predominant activity on Northern Ireland farms in 2022 was cattle and sheep. 79 per cent of farms in Northern Ireland have some cattle, 38 per cent have some sheep. Over three-quarters of farms in Northern Ireland are very small, in 2022 there were 26,089 farms in Northern Ireland with approximately one million hectares of land farmed.[211]  Northern Ireland is in a unique position where it can sell goods to the rest of the United Kingdom and the European Union tariff-free, free from customs declarations, rules of origin certificates and non-tariff barriers on the sale of goods to both regions.[212][213]  Below is a comparison of the goods being sold and purchased between Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom, compared with the goods being exported and imported between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland:  Northern Ireland has underdeveloped transport infrastructure, with most infrastructure concentrated around Greater Belfast, Greater Derry, and Craigavon. Northern Ireland is served by three airports\u2014Belfast International near Antrim, George Best Belfast City integrated into the railway network at Sydenham in East Belfast, and City of Derry in County Londonderry. There are upgrade plans to transform the railway network in Northern Ireland including new lines from Derry to Portadown and Belfast to Newry, though it will take the best part of 25 years to deliver.[215] There are major seaports at Larne and Belfast which carry passengers and freight between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  Passenger railways are operated by Northern Ireland Railways. With Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann (Irish Rail), Northern Ireland Railways co-operates in providing the joint Enterprise service between Dublin Connolly and Lanyon Place. The whole of Ireland has a mainline railway network with a gauge of 5\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in (1,600\u00a0mm), which is unique in Europe and has resulted in distinct rolling stock designs. The only preserved line of this gauge on the island is the Downpatrick and County Down Railway, which operates heritage steam and diesel locomotives. Main railway lines linking to and from Belfast Great Victoria Street railway station and Lanyon Place railway station are:  The Derry line is the busiest single-track railway line in the United Kingdom, carrying 3 million passengers per annum, the Derry-Londonderry Line has also been described by Michael Palin as \"one of the most beautiful rail journeys in the world\".[216]  Main motorways are:  Additional short motorway spurs include:  The cross-border road connecting the ports of Larne in Northern Ireland and Rosslare Harbour in the Republic of Ireland is being upgraded as part of an EU-funded scheme. European route E01 runs from Larne through the island of Ireland, Spain, and Portugal to Seville.  Northern Ireland shares both the culture of Ulster and the culture of the United Kingdom.  Northern Ireland has witnessed rising numbers of tourists. Attractions include concert venues, cultural festivals, musical and artistic traditions, countryside and geographical sites of interest, public houses, welcoming hospitality, and sports (especially golf and fishing).[217] Since 1987 public houses have been allowed to open on Sundays, despite some opposition.  Parades are a prominent feature of Northern Ireland society,[218] more so than in the rest of Ireland or the United Kingdom. Most are held by Protestant fraternities such as the Orange Order, and Ulster loyalist marching bands. Each summer, during the \"marching season\", these groups have hundreds of parades, deck streets with British flags, bunting and specially-made arches, and light large towering bonfires in the \"Eleventh Night\" celebrations.[219] The biggest parades are held on 12 July (The Twelfth). There is often tension when these activities take place near Catholic neighbourhoods, which sometimes leads to violence.[220]  The Ulster Cycle is a large body of prose and verse centring on the traditional heroes of the Ulaid in what is now eastern Ulster. This is one of the four major cycles of Irish mythology. The cycle centres on the reign of Conchobar mac Nessa, who is said to have been the king of Ulster around the 1st century. He ruled from Emain Macha (now Navan Fort near Armagh), and had a fierce rivalry with queen Medb and king Ailill of Connacht and their ally, Fergus mac R\u00f3ich, former king of Ulster. The foremost hero of the cycle is Conchobar's nephew C\u00fachulainn, who features in the epic prose\/poem An T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge (The Cattle Raid of Cooley, a casus belli between Ulster and Connaught).  Northern Ireland comprises a patchwork of communities whose national loyalties are represented in some areas by flags flown from flagpoles or lamp posts. The Union Jack and the former Northern Ireland flag are flown in many loyalist areas, and the Tricolour, adopted by republicans as the flag of Ireland in 1916,[222] is flown in some republican areas. Even kerbstones in some areas are painted red-white-blue or green-white-orange, depending on whether local people express unionist\/loyalist or nationalist\/republican sympathies.[223]  The official flag is that of the state having sovereignty over the territory, i.e. the Union Flag.[224] The former Northern Ireland flag, also known as the \"Ulster Banner\" or \"Red Hand Flag\", is a banner derived from the coat of arms of the Government of Northern Ireland until 1972. Since 1972, it has had no official status. The Union Flag and the Ulster Banner are used exclusively by unionists. The UK flags policy states that in Northern Ireland, \"The Ulster flag and the Cross of St Patrick have no official status and, under the Flags Regulations, are not permitted to be flown from Government Buildings.\"[225][226]  The Irish Rugby Football Union and the Church of Ireland have used the Saint Patrick's Saltire or \"Cross of St\u00a0Patrick\". This red saltire on a white field was used to represent Ireland in the flag of the United Kingdom. It is still used by some British Army regiments. Foreign flags are also found, such as the Palestinian flags in some nationalist areas and Israeli flags in some unionist areas.[227]  The United Kingdom national anthem of \"God Save the King\" is often played at state events in Northern Ireland. At the Commonwealth Games and some other sporting events, the Northern Ireland team uses the Ulster Banner as its flag\u2014notwithstanding its lack of official status\u2014and the Londonderry Air (usually set to lyrics as Danny Boy), which also has no official status, as its national anthem.[228][229] The Northern Ireland national football team also uses the Ulster Banner as its flag but uses \"God Save The King\" as its anthem.[230] Major Gaelic Athletic Association matches are opened by the national anthem of the Republic of Ireland, \"Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann (The Soldier's Song)\", which is also used by most other all-Ireland sporting organisations.[231] Since 1995, the Ireland rugby union team has used a specially commissioned song, \"Ireland's Call\" as the team's anthem. The Irish national anthem is also played at Dublin home matches, being the anthem of the host country.[232]  Northern Irish murals have become well-known features of Northern Ireland, depicting past and present events and documenting peace and cultural diversity. Almost 2,000 murals have been documented in Northern Ireland since the 1970s.  The BBC has a division called BBC Northern Ireland with headquarters in Belfast and operates BBC One Northern Ireland and BBC Two Northern Ireland. As well as broadcasting standard UK-wide programmes, BBC NI produces local content, including a news break-out called BBC Newsline. The ITV franchise in Northern Ireland is UTV. The state-owned Channel 4 and the privately owned Channel 5 also broadcast in Northern Ireland. Access is also available to satellite and cable services.[233] All Northern Ireland viewers must obtain a UK TV licence to watch live television transmissions or use BBC iPlayer.  RT\u00c9, the national broadcaster of the Republic of Ireland, is available over the air to most parts of Northern Ireland via reception overspill of the Republic's Saorview service,[234] or via satellite and cable. Since the digital TV switchover, RT\u00c9 One, RT\u00c92 and the Irish-language channel TG4, are now available over the air on the UK's Freeview system from transmitters within Northern Ireland.[235] Although they are transmitted in standard definition, a Freeview HD box or television is required for reception.  As well as the standard UK-wide radio stations from the BBC, Northern Ireland is home to many local radio stations, such as Cool FM, Q Radio, Downtown Radio and U105. The BBC has two regional radio stations which broadcast in Northern Ireland, BBC Radio Ulster and BBC Radio Foyle.  Besides the UK and Irish national newspapers, there are three main regional newspapers published in Northern Ireland. These are the Belfast Telegraph, The Irish News and The News Letter.[236] According to the Audit Bureau of Circulations (UK) the average daily circulation for these three titles in 2018 was:  Northern Ireland uses the same telecommunications and postal services as the rest of the United Kingdom at standard domestic rates and there are no mobile roaming charges between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.[239][240] People in Northern Ireland who live close to the border with the Republic of Ireland may inadvertently switch over to the Irish mobile networks, causing international roaming fees to be applied.[241] Calls from landlines in Northern Ireland to numbers in the Republic of Ireland are charged at the same rate as those to numbers in Great Britain, while landline numbers in Northern Ireland can similarly be called from the Republic of Ireland at domestic rates, using the 048 prefix.[242]  Many sports are organised on an all-Ireland basis, with a single governing body or team for the whole island.[243] The most notable exception is association football (soccer), which has a separate governing body, league and national team for Northern Ireland.[243][244]  The Irish Football Association (IFA) serves as the organising body for men's domestic and national association football in Northern Ireland, it is a member of the International Football Association Board which sets the rules for association football.[245]  The NIWFA are responsible for women's domestic and national association football in Northern Ireland.  The NIFL Premiership is a professional men's football league which operates at the highest division of the Northern Ireland Football League, the current format has been organised with 12 clubs. The winners will enter the first qualifying round of the Champions League, if they do not progress they will enter the Europa League or Europa Conference League depending on performance. The two runners-up progress to the Europa Conference League with play-offs for another Europa Conference League position.[246]  The NLFL Women's Premiership is a professional women's football league which operates at the highest division in Northern Ireland with 10 clubs. The winner qualifies for a spot in the UEFA Women's Champions League. The men's Northern Ireland national football team qualified for the 1958 FIFA World Cup, 1982 FIFA World Cup and 1986 FIFA World Cup, making it to the quarter-finals in 1958 and 1982 and made it the first knockout round in the European Championships in 2016.  The IRFU is the governing body for the sport of Rugby Union on the island of Ireland (Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland).[247] Rugby in Northern Ireland is run within the historic province of Ulster which includes Northern Ireland plus 3 counties from the Republic of Ireland - Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan.  The Ireland national rugby league team has participated in the Emerging Nations Tournament (1995), the Super League World Nines (1996), the World Cup (2000, 2008, 2013, 2017, 2021), European Nations Cup (since 2003) and Victory Cup (2004). The Ireland A rugby league team competes annually in the Amateur Four Nations competition (since 2002) and the St Patrick's Day Challenge (since 1995).  The Ireland cricket team represents both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It is a full member of the International Cricket Council, having been granted Test status and full membership by the ICC in June 2017. The side competes in Test cricket, the highest level of competitive cricket in the international arena, and is one of the 12 full-member countries of the ICC. Ireland men's side has played in the Cricket World Cup and T20 World Cup and has won the ICC Intercontinental Cup four times. The women's side has played in the Women's World Cup. One of the men's side's regular international venues is Stormont in Belfast.  The governing body for golf on the island of Ireland is Golf Ireland, it is the successor to the Golfing Union of Ireland, governing body for men's and boy's amateur golf, and the oldest golfing union in the world, which was founded in Belfast in 1891, and the Irish Ladies Golf Union. Northern Ireland's golf courses include the Royal Belfast Golf Club (the earliest, formed in 1881), Royal Portrush Golf Club, which is the only course outside Great Britain to have hosted The Open Championship, and Royal County Down Golf Club (Golf Digest magazine's top-rated course outside the United States).[248][249] Northern Ireland had three major champions in the space of just 14 months from the U.S. Open in 2010 to The Open Championship in 2011. Notable golfers include Fred Daly (winner of The Open in 1947), Ryder Cup players Ronan Rafferty and David Feherty, leading European Tour professionals David Jones, Michael Hoey (a five-time winner on the tour) and Gareth Maybin, as well as three recent major winners Graeme McDowell (winner of the U.S. Open in 2010, the first European to do so since 1970), Rory McIlroy (winner of four majors) and Darren Clarke (winner of The Open in 2011).[250][251] Northern Ireland has also contributed several players to the Great Britain and Ireland Walker Cup team, including Alan Dunbar and Paul Cutler who played on the victorious 2011 team in Scotland. Dunbar also won The Amateur Championship in 2012, at Royal Troon.  Both the national flag and the national anthem of present-day Ireland drive origins directly from the Rising. At first, it still appeared as if the revolutionaries would take over the old symbols because on the roof of their headquarters, the Dublin General Post Office, a green flag with the harp was hoisted next to the republican tricolour although with the inscription 'Irish Republic'. Even 'Got save Ireland' was sung by the revolutionaries during Easter week. But after the failure of the Rising and the subsequent executions of the leading revolutionaries the tricolour and 'The Soldier's Song' became more and more popular as symbols of the rebellion. 54\u00b037\u2032N 6\u00b037\u2032W\ufeff \/ \ufeff54.61\u00b0N 6.62\u00b0W\ufeff \/ 54.61; -6.62 "},{"title":"The Football Association","content":"  The Football Association (known by its abbreviation The FA) is the governing body of association football in England and the Crown Dependencies of Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. Formed in 1863, it is the oldest football association in the world and is responsible for overseeing all aspects of the amateur and professional game in its territory.  The FA facilitates all competitive football matches within its remit at national level, and indirectly at local level through the county football associations. It runs numerous competitions, the most famous of which is the FA Cup. It is also responsible for appointing the management of the men's, women's, and youth national football teams.  The FA is a member of both UEFA and FIFA and holds a permanent seat on the International Football Association Board (IFAB) which is responsible for the Laws of the Game. As the first football association, it does not use the national name \"English\" in its title. The FA is based at Wembley Stadium, London. The FA is a member of the British Olympic Association, meaning that the FA has control over the men's and women's Great Britain Olympic football team.[1]  All of England's professional football teams are members of the Football Association. Although it does not run the day-to-day operations of the Premier League, it has veto power over the appointment of the league chairman and chief executive and over any changes to league rules.[2] The English Football League, made up of the three fully professional divisions below the Premier League, is self-governing, subject to the FA's sanctions.  For centuries before the first meeting of the Football Association in the Freemasons' Tavern on Great Queen Street, London on 26 October 1863, there were no universally accepted rules for playing football.[3][4] Ebenezer Cobb Morley, as captain of Barnes, in 1862 wrote to Bell's Life newspaper proposing a governing body for the sport \"with the object of establishing a definite code of rules for the regulation of the game\"; the letter led to the first meeting at The Freemasons' Tavern that created the FA in 1863. Morley was a founding member.[4] Six meetings near London's Covent Garden, at 81\u201382 Long Acre,[5] ended in a split between the Association football and Rugby football.[6] Both of them had their own uniforms, rituals, gestures and highly formalised rules.[7]  In each public school the game was formalised according to local conditions; but when the schoolboys reached university, chaos ensued when the players used different rules, so members of the University of Cambridge devised and published a set of Cambridge Rules in 1848 which was widely adopted.[3] Another set of rules, the Sheffield Rules, was used by a number of clubs in the North of England from the 1850s.[citation needed]  Eleven London football clubs and schools representatives met on 26 October 1863 to agree on common rules.[3][4] The founding clubs present at the first meeting were:  Charterhouse sent their captain, B.F. Hartshorne, but declined the offer to join.[10] Many of these clubs are now defunct or still play rugby. Civil Service FC, who now plays in the Southern Amateur League, is the only one of the original eleven football clubs still in existence, with an unbroken history, and playing association football,[4] although Forest School has been a member since the fifth meeting in December 1863. Both Barnes and Wanderers have been refounded as football clubs in the modern era.  Ebenezer Cobb Morley was the FA's first secretary (1863\u201366) and its second president (1867\u201374) and drafted the Laws of the Game generally called the \"London Rules\" at his home in Barnes, London.[4] He played in the first-ever match in 1863.  The first version of the rules for the modern game was drawn up over a series of six meetings held in The Freemasons' Tavern from October till December.[4] Of the clubs at the first meeting, Crusaders, Surbiton and Charterhouse did not attend the subsequent meetings, replaced instead by the Royal Navy School, Wimbledon School and Forest School.[11]  At the final meeting, F. M. Campbell, the first FA treasurer and the Blackheath representative, withdrew his club from the FA over the removal of two draft rules at the previous meeting, the first which allowed for the running with the ball in hand and the second, obstructing such a run by hacking (kicking an opponent in the shins), tripping and holding. Other English rugby clubs followed this lead and did not join the FA but instead in 1871 formed the Rugby Football Union.[3] The term \"soccer\" dates back to this split to refer to football played under the \"association\" rules. After six clubs had withdrawn as they supported the opposing Rugby Rules, the Football Association had just nine members in January 1864: Barnes, Kilburn, Crystal Palace, War Office (Civil Service), Forest Club, Forest School, Sheffield, Uppingham and Royal Engineers (Chatham).[12]  An inaugural game using the new FA rules was initially scheduled for Battersea Park on 2 January 1864, but enthusiastic members of the FA could not wait for the new year: the first game under F. A. rules was played at Mortlake on 19 December 1863 between Morley's Barnes team and their neighbours Richmond (who were not members of the FA), ending in a goalless draw. The Richmond side were obviously unimpressed by the new rules in practice because they subsequently helped form the Rugby Football Union in 1871. The Battersea Park game was the first exhibition game using FA rules, and was played there on Saturday 9 January 1864.[13]  The members of the opposing teams for this game were chosen by the President of the FA (A. Pember) and the Secretary (E. C. Morley) and included many well-known footballers of the day.[14] After the first match according to the new FA rules a toast was given \"Success to football, irrespective of class or creed\".[15]  Another notable match was London v Sheffield, in which a representative team from the FA played Sheffield FC under Association rules in March 1866; Charles Alcock described this game as \"first [match] of any importance under the auspices of the Football Association\".[16]  Alcock (of Harrow School) of the Wanderers was elected to the committee of the FA in 1866, becoming its first full-time secretary and treasurer in 1870. He masterminded the creation of the Football Association Cup[17]\u2014the longest-running association football competition in the world\u2014in 1871. Fifteen participating clubs subscribed to purchase a trophy. The first Cup Final was held at The Oval on 16 March 1872, fought between the Wanderers and the Royal Engineers (RE), watched by 2,000 spectators.[4] In 1874 Francis Marindin became the third president of the Football Association.  After many years of wrangling between the London-based Football Association and the Sheffield Football Association, the FA Cup brought the acceptance that one undisputed set of laws was required. The two associations had played 16 inter-association matches under differing rules; the Sheffield Rules, the London Rules and Mixed Rules. In April 1877, those laws were set with a number of Sheffield Rules being incorporated. In 1890 Arthur Kinnaird replaced Major Francis Marindin, becoming the fourth president of the Football Association. Kinnaird had at that time been a FA committeeman since the age of 21, in 1868. Kinnaird remained president for the next 33 years, until his death in 1923.  The FA Cup was initially contested by mostly southern, amateur teams, but more professionally organised northern clubs began to dominate the competition during the early 1880s; \"The turning point, north replacing south, working class defeating upper and professionals impinging upon the amateurs' territory, came in 1883.\"[18] Hitherto, public school sides had played a dribbling game punctuated by violent tackles, but a new passing style developed in Scotland was successfully adopted by some Lancashire teams, along with a more organised approach to training. Blackburn Olympic reached the final in March 1883 and defeated Old Etonians.[19] Near-neighbours Blackburn Rovers started to pay players, and the following season won the first of three consecutive FA Cups.[19][18] The FA initially tried to outlaw professionalism but, in the face of a threatened breakaway body (the British Football Association), by 1885 was forced to permit payments to players.[20] Three years later, in 1888, the first Football League was established, formed by six professional clubs from northwest England and six from the midlands.[18]  In 1992, the Football Association took control of the newly created Premier League which consisted of 22 clubs who had broken away from the First Division of the Football League. The Premier League reduced to 20 clubs in 1995 and is one of the richest football leagues in the world.[21]  The Football Association has updated their logo several times. They celebrated their 150th year with a special 2013\u20132014 season logo. The shield design (taken from the coat of arms of the Football Association) is the same, but the three lions, rosettes and border are in gold instead of black and red, with the usual white background. The title strip above reads \"The FA\" in white on gold, and there is a scroll below reading \"150 years\" in white on gold, between \"1863\" and \"2013\".[22][23]  By 1921 women's football had become increasingly popular through the charitable games played by women's teams during and after the First World War. In a move that was widely seen as caused by jealousy of the crowds' interest in women's games which frequently exceeded that of the top men's teams, in 1921 the Football Association banned all women's teams from playing on grounds affiliated to the FA because they thought football damaged women's bodies.[24][25] For several decades, this meant that women's football virtually ceased to exist.  The decision to exclude women was only reversed from 1969 when, after the increased interest in football caused by England's 1966 World Cup triumph, the Women's Football Association was founded,[26] although it would take a further two years \u2013 and an order from UEFA \u2013 to force the (men's) Football Association to remove its restrictions on the playing rights of women's teams.[27] It was not until 1983 that the WFA was able to affiliate to the FA as a \"County Association\" and only in 1993 did the FA found the \"Women's Football Committee\" to run women's football in England.[28] The \"Women's Football Conference\", as it is now known, has representation on the FA Council equivalent to a County Football Association.[29]  In December 2016, five former FA executives \u2013 David Bernstein, David Davies, Greg Dyke, Alex Horne and David Triesman \u2013 called on Parliament's Culture, Media and Sport Committee to propose legislation to reform the FA, saying it was outdated, held back by \"elderly white men\", and unable to counter the power of the Premier League or \"to reform and modernise in a fast-changing world\".[30]  In April 2017, it was announced that some reforms, including reducing the size of the FA's board and increasing the number of women, would be submitted for approval to the FA's annual general meeting on 18 May. However, the proposed changes were criticised by some for not going far enough, particularly to improve minority representation.[31] The proposals were approved at the AGM and include:[32]  However, pressure for FA reform continued fuelled by allegations of racism and bullying in relation to the Mark Sampson and Eniola Aluko cases, and the historical sexual abuse scandal.[33] In October 2017, FA chairman Greg Clarke announced a \"fundamental\" review of the FA after admitting it had \"lost the trust of the public\" following the Sampson controversy.[34] In the same month, Clarke was criticised by sexual abuse victim Andy Woodward and the Professional Footballers' Association's chief executive Gordon Taylor for remarks Clarke made to a Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee (DCMS) hearing.[35][36][37]  In November 2020, Clarke resigned as FA chairman over his use of the term \"coloured\" when referring to black players in comments to the DCMS committee via video link.[38] The FA subsequently announced they would seek a new chairman, with hopes there would be an announcement as to the successor by March 2021.[39]  In mid-November 2016, allegations of widespread historical sexual abuse at football clubs dating back to the 1970s began to emerge. On 21 November, the Football Association said it would set up a helpline;[40] this was established with the NSPCC and opened on 24 November,[41] reportedly receiving over 50 calls within the first two hours,[42] over 100 by 27 November,[43] and 860 (\"more than three times as many referrals as in the first three days of the Jimmy Savile scandal\") by 1 December[44] with 350 individuals alleging abuse.[45] The FA and NSPCC also collaborated to produce a film about how to keep children safe in the sport, featuring the captains of England's men's, women's and cerebral palsy football teams (Wayne Rooney, Steph Houghton and Jack Rutter).[46]  On 27 November, the FA announced it was to set up an internal review, led by independent counsel Kate Gallafent QC, into what Crewe and Manchester City knew about convicted child sex offender Barry Bennell and allegations of child sexual abuse in football, and investigate what information it was aware of at the time of the alleged offences.[47]  The FA was criticised by Conservative MP Damian Collins, chairman of the House of Commons' Culture, Media and Sport Committee, for being too slow in reacting and not instigating a wider review.[48] Former sport minister Gerry Sutcliffe talked of previous concern about how the FA dealt with governance of the sport and with youth development (in the 1990s, the FA was said to have reacted \"dismissively\" to worries about sexual abuse in the game, and too slow to implement criminal record checks;[49] in 2003, the FA had scrapped a project meant to ensure children were being protected from sexual abuse;[50] and FA officials had been uncooperative with the review project, with ten of 14 FA staff not replying to interview requests and a report by the researchers of others being \"prevented\/bullied\" from talking).[51] Sutcliffe said an independent body, such as the Department for Culture, Media and Sport should look at the issue rather than the FA investigating itself: \"What I've seen in football over the years is that they're very narrow, very insular, and may not do a proper job even though with the right intentions.\"[52]  On 6 December 2016, the FA announced that, due to \"the increased scope of the review since it was announced\"[53] and Gallafent's other professional commitments, the review would be conducted by Clive Sheldon QC.[54] On 11 January 2017, the Sheldon review had made its first call for evidence, writing to all football clubs in England and Wales, amateur and professional, asking for information by 15 March about allegations of child sexual abuse between 1970 and 2005.[55] In March 2018, it was reported that the scale of evidence provided, plus the \"chaotic nature of the archiving\", had delayed the inquiry team's sift through the FA's legal files; around 500,000 pages of material from 6,000 files were uploaded to a digital platform, and 353 documents were identified as highly relevant. Sheldon expected to start writing his final report in August 2018.[56]  In July 2018, it was reported that the FA's independent inquiry had found no evidence of an institutional cover-up or of a paedophile ring operating within football. Sheldon's report, likely to be highly critical of several clubs, was initially expected to be delivered to the FA in September 2018,[57] but its publication was delayed, potentially by up to a year, pending the retrial of Bob Higgins and possible further charges against Barry Bennell.[58]  The 700-page report was eventually published on 17 March 2021. It identified failures to act adequately on complaints or rumours of sexual abuse at eight professional clubs: Aston Villa, Chelsea, Crewe Alexandra, Manchester City, Newcastle United, Peterborough, Southampton and Stoke City.[59] The report also made 13 recommendations for further improvements, including clubs employing qualified safeguarding officers, an FA board member to be the designated \"children's safeguarding champion\", spot checks of amateur clubs, a \"national day of safeguarding in football\" and an annual safeguarding report. However, the measures were criticised for being too late and lacking ambition. The FA issued a \"heartfelt apology\" to survivors and said it would be implementing all of Sheldon's recommendations.[59]  The football associations within the Crown Dependencies of Jersey (Jersey Football Association), Guernsey (Guernsey Football Association) and the Isle of Man (Isle of Man Football Association) are affiliated to the FA despite having a separate identity from that of the United Kingdom and by extension England.[60] They are considered county football associations by the FA. Matt Le Tissier and Graeme Le Saux have represented the FA's full national representative team and were born in Guernsey and Jersey respectively.[61]  The Guernsey Football Association, Isle of Man Football Association and Jersey Football Association have been affiliated with the FA since 1903, 1908 and 1905 respectively.[62][63][64]  A loophole was closed in May 2008 by FIFA which allowed players born in the Channel Islands to choose which home nation within the United Kingdom they will represent at international level. During the 1990s, Trevor Wood (Jersey) and Chris Tardif (Guernsey) represented Northern Ireland.  The British overseas territory of Gibraltar's Gibraltar Football Association was affiliated to the FA from 1911 until it opted to become a fully recognised member of UEFA, a feat achieved after a 14-year legal battle.[when?] Joseph Nunez, the Gibraltar FA President claimed they were \"unilaterally thrown out\" of the FA following an intervention from Geoff Thompson.[62]  On the other hand, the Hong Kong Football Association (HKFA), established in 1914, is one of the oldest football associations in Asia. They joined FIFA in 1954, and were also one of twelve founding members of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). HK played an important role in the early development of Asian football and hosted the first Asian Cup competition in 1956. The dependent territory was relinquished by the UK in 1997 and handed over to the People's Republic of China.  Some of the other British overseas territories have local football associations or leagues (including the Anguilla Football Association, the Ascension Island Football League, the Bermuda Football Association, the British Virgin Islands Football Association, the Cayman Islands Football Association, the Falkland Islands Football League, the Montserrat Football Association, the Turks and Caicos Islands Football Association), but these are not considered subsidiary to the Football Association.  Although the British overseas territories are too small to support professional teams,[citation needed] they have produced players such as Clyde Best who have gone on to play professionally in the Football Association, and referees such as Carlyle Crockwell, who have refereed FIFA matches.  The Football Association first joined FIFA in 1905. The British Associations (England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales) opted to leave FIFA after World War I when FIFA chose not to exclude those who were part of the Central Powers from the organisation. The British Associations' stance had changed by 1922 and in 1924 they had rejoined FIFA.[b]  The British Olympic Association had fought against 'broken time' \u2013 monetary compensation for athletes' earnings when competing in the Olympic games. At the 1925 Olympic Congress in Prague, the British had made an amendment that concluded governing federations should define amateur status for their sports but only in accordance with the definition of amateurism accepted by the Olympic Congress. In 1928, Switzerland proposed to FIFA that in certain circumstances, 'broken time' payments should be allowed and FIFA accepted. The FA resigned from FIFA in protest against the proposal. As a result of the FA's resignation, England did not participate in the 1930, 1934 or 1938 FIFA World Cup.  At the 1930 Olympic Congress in Berlin, Belgian delegates proposed that for each sport the definition of amateur status be left to its international federation. The BOA argued for a common definition of amateurism and argued that 'broken time' payments were against the Olympic ideal.  The FA rejoined FIFA in 1946 and participated in their first World Cup in 1950. One of the first actions of the Football Association was to request the expulsion of the German and Japanese national football associations for their countries' role in World War II. Germany and Japan were prevented from qualifying for the 1950 FIFA World Cup as a consequence. They were re-acquainted with FIFA in 1950 following a second request from Switzerland who had had a previous request rejected in 1948.  The FA runs several competitions:  The FA's main commercial asset is its ownership of the rights to England internationals and the FA Cup. Broadcasting income remains the FA's largest revenue stream with both domestic and international broadcasting rights for England fixtures and the FA Cup tied up until at least 2021.  For the four seasons from 2008 to 2012, the FA secured \u00a3425\u00a0million from ITV and Setanta for England and FA Cup games domestic television rights, a 42% increase over the previous contract, and \u00a3145\u00a0million for overseas television rights, up 272% on the \u00a339\u00a0million received for the previous four-year period.[66] However, during 2008\u201309 Setanta UK went into administration, which weakened the FA's cashflow position.  Turnover for the year ending 31 July 2016 was \u00a3370\u00a0million on which it made a profit after tax of \u00a37\u00a0million. It has also made an investment of \u00a3125\u00a0million back into every level of Football in 2016. In July 2015 the FA announced plans to carry out a significant organisational restructure, in order to deliver considerable cost savings to invest in elite England teams, facilities and grassroots coaching.[67]  The FA's income does not include the turnover of English football clubs, which are independent businesses. As well as running its own operations the FA chooses five charities each year to which it gives financial support.[68][69]  In three years up to 2014, the FA received \u00a3350,000 in fines from players over comments made on Twitter. The highest fine imposed was a \u00a390,000 fine to Ashley Cole in 2012 after calling the FA \"a bunch of twats.\" The FA became stricter on comments made by players on Twitter, disciplining 121 players in three years.[70]  The FA has a figurehead President, who since 1939 has always been a member of the British royal family. The Chairman of the FA has overall responsibility for policy. Traditionally this person rose through the ranks of the FA's committee structure (e.g. by holding posts such as the chairmanship of a county football association). In 2008 politician David Triesman was appointed as the FA's first \"independent chairman\", the first from outside the football hierarchy. The day-to-day head of the FA was known as the Secretary until 1989, when the job title was changed to Chief Executive.[71][72][73]  Taken from The FA's website on 9 January 2022[74]  National Game representatives:  Professional Game representatives:   Independent Non-Executive directors:  Board observers: "},{"title":"English-speaking world","content":"  The English-speaking world comprises the 88 countries and territories in which English is an official, administrative, or cultural language. In the early 2000s, one billion to two billion people spoke English,[1][2] making it the largest language by number of speakers, the third largest language by number of native speakers, and the most widespread language geographically. The countries in which English is the native language of most people are sometimes termed the Anglosphere. Speakers of English are called Anglophones.   England and the Scottish Lowlands, a country and a region of the United Kingdom, are the birthplace of the English language; the modern form of the language has been spread around the world since the 17th century, first by the worldwide influence of England and later the United Kingdom, and then by that of the United States. Through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries, English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional fields, such as science, navigation and law.[3]  The United States and India have the most total English speakers, with 306 million and 265 million, respectively. These are followed by Pakistan (104 million), the United Kingdom (68 million), and Nigeria (60 million).[4] As of 2022, there were about 400 million native speakers of English.[5]  Including people who speak English as a second language, estimates of the total number of Anglophones vary from 1.5 billion to 2 billion.[2] David Crystal calculated in 2003 that non-native speakers outnumbered native speakers by a ratio of three to one.[6]  Besides the major varieties of English\u2014American, British, Canadian, Australian, Irish, New Zealand English\u2014and their sub-varieties, countries such as South Africa, India, Nigeria, the Philippines, Singapore, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago also have millions of native speakers of dialect continua ranging from English-based creole languages to Standard English. Other countries and territories, such as Ghana, also use English as their primary official language even though it is not the native language of most of the people.  English is the primary natively spoken language in several countries and territories. Five of the largest of these are sometimes described as the \"core Anglosphere\";[7][8][9] they are the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.  The term \"Anglosphere\" can sometimes be extended to include other countries and territories where English or an English Creole language is also the primary native language and English is the primary language of government and education, such as Ireland, Gibraltar, and the Commonwealth Caribbean.[10]  While English is also spoken by a majority of people as a second language in a handful of countries such as Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden, these countries are not considered part of the English-speaking world as the language is still viewed primarily as a foreign tongue and does not serve an important cultural role in society.[11]  English is an official language (de facto and de jure) of the following countries and territories.[12]  Although not official, English is also an important language in some former colonies and protectorates of the British Empire where it is used as an administrative language, such as Bahrain, Brunei, Egypt, Kuwait, Malaysia, Qatar, Sri Lanka and United Arab Emirates.  Because English is so widely spoken, it has often been called a \"world language\", the lingua franca of the modern era,[13] and while it is not an official language in most countries, it is currently the language most often taught as a foreign language.[6][14] It is, by international treaty, the official language for aeronautical[15] and maritime[16] communications. English is one of the official languages of the United Nations and many other international organizations, including the International Olympic Committee. It is also one of two co-official languages for astronauts (besides the Russian language) serving on board the International Space Station.[citation needed]  English is studied most often in the European Union, and the perception of the usefulness of foreign languages among Europeans is 67% in favour of English, ahead of 17% for German and 16% for French (as of 2012[update]). In some of the non\u2013English-speaking EU countries, the following percentages of adults claimed to be able to converse in English in 2012: 90% in the Netherlands; 89% in Malta; 86% in Sweden and Denmark; 73% in Cyprus, Croatia, and Austria; 70% in Finland; and over 50% in Greece, Belgium, Luxembourg, Slovenia, and Germany. In 2012, excluding native speakers, 38% of Europeans consider that they can speak English.[17]  Books, magazines, and newspapers written in English are available in many countries around the world; English is the most commonly used language in the sciences,[13] with Science Citation Index reporting as early as 1997 that 95% of its articles were written in English, even though only half of them came from authors in English-speaking countries.  In publishing, English literature predominates considerably, with 28% of all books published in the world [Leclerc 2011][full citation needed] and 30% of web content in 2011 (down from 50% in 2000).[14]  The increasing use of the English language globally has had a large impact on many other languages, leading to language shift and language death,[18] and to claims of linguistic imperialism.[citation needed] English itself has become more open to language shift as multiple regional varieties feed back into the language as a whole.[19] "},{"title":"Poetic justice","content":"Poetic justice, also called poetic irony, is a literary device with which ultimately virtue is rewarded and misdeeds are punished. In modern literature,[1] it is often accompanied by an ironic twist of fate related to the character's own action, hence the name poetic irony.[2]  English drama critic Thomas Rymer coined the phrase in The Tragedies of the Last Age Consider'd (1678) to describe how a work should inspire proper moral behaviour in its audience by illustrating the triumph of good over evil. The demand for poetic justice is consistent in Classical authorities and shows up in Horace, Plutarch, and Quintillian, so Rymer's phrasing is a reflection of a commonplace. Philip Sidney, in The Defence of Poesy (1595) argued that poetic justice was, in fact, the reason that fiction should be allowed in a civilized nation.  Notably, poetic justice does not merely require that vice be punished and virtue rewarded, but also that logic triumph. If, for example, a character is dominated by greed for most of a romance or drama, they cannot become generous. The action of a play, poem, or fiction must obey the rules of logic as well as morality. During the late 17th century, critics pursuing a neo-classical standard criticized William Shakespeare in favor of Ben Jonson precisely on the grounds that Shakespeare's characters change during the course of the play.[3] When Restoration comedy, in particular, flouted poetic justice by rewarding libertines and punishing dull-witted moralists, there was a backlash in favor of drama, in particular, of more strict moral correspondence. "},{"title":"Rugby ball","content":"A rugby ball is an elongated ellipsoidal ball used in both codes of rugby football. Its measurements and weight are specified by World Rugby and the Rugby League International Federation, the governing bodies for both codes, rugby union and rugby league respectively.  The rugby ball has an oval shape, four panels and a weight of about 400 grams. It is often confused with some balls of similar dimensions used in American, Canadian and Australian football.  William Gilbert started making footballs for the neighbouring Rugby School in 1823. The balls had an inner-tube made of a pig's bladder. Both men owned boot and shoe making businesses located close to Rugby school.[1] In 1870, Richard Lindon introduced rubber inner-tubes and because of the pliability of rubber, the shape gradually changed from a sphere to an egg. Lindon and Bernardo Solano started making balls for Rugby School out of hand stitched, leather casings and pigs' bladders. The rugby ball's distinctive shape is supposedly due to the pig's bladder, although early balls were more plum-shape than oval. The balls varied in size in the beginning depending upon how large the pig's bladder was.[2]  Around 1862, Richard Lindon was desperate to find a replacement for the pig\u2019s bladder and used an India rubber bladder instead. India rubber was too tough to inflate by mouth and so having been inspired by air syringes, he created a large brass air pump to inflate his rugby balls.[3] Lindon also claimed to invent the rugby ball and its distinctive oval shape but didn't patent his design for either the ball, the bladder or the pump. By the 1880s there were several manufacturers of 'footballs' in England all using the same process.[1]  The size and shape of the ball was not written into the rules until 1892, when it was determined as follows:[1] - Length 11 to 11 1\/4 inches - Circumference (end on) 30 to 31 inches - Circumference (in width) 25 1\/2 to 26 inches - Weight: 12 to 13 ounces  - Hand sewn with not less than 8 stitches to the inch  In 1892 the RFU endorsed ovalness as the compulsory shape. The gradual flattening of the ball continued over the years.[4]  The introduction of synthetic footballs over the traditional leather balls, in both rugby codes, was originally governed by weather conditions. If the playing surface was wet, the synthetic ball was used, as it didn't absorb water and become heavy. Eventually, the leather balls were phased out completely. Polyester is used as backing material to hold the ball's oval shape, along with additional material for grips to enhance performance. The ball is stitched with polyester thread and coated with wax to make it more water-resistant.[5]  The rugby ball used in rugby union is a prolate spheroid essentially elliptical in profile. Modern footballs are manufactured in a variety of colors and patterns. A regulation football is 28\u201330\u00a0cm (11\u201312\u00a0in) long and 58\u201362\u00a0cm (23\u201324\u00a0in) in circumference at its widest point. It weighs 410\u2013460\u00a0g (14\u201316\u00a0oz) and is inflated to 65.7\u201368.8\u00a0kPa (9.5\u201310.0\u00a0psi).[6]  In 1980, traditional leather-encased balls, which were prone to water-logging, were replaced with balls encased in synthetic waterproof materials.[4] The Gilbert Synergie was the match ball of the 2007 Rugby World Cup.  Most of the professional leagues use Adidas, Gilbert, Mitre or Webb Ellis manufactured balls.[7][8][9]  Rugby league is played with a prolate spheroid shaped football which is inflated with nitrogen.[10] A referee will stop play immediately if the ball does not meet the requirements of size and shape.[10] Traditionally made of brown leather, modern footballs are synthetic and manufactured in a variety of colours and patterns. Senior competitions should use light coloured balls to allow spectators to see the ball more easily.[10] The football used in rugby league is known as \"international size\" or \"size 5\" and is approximately 27\u00a0cm (11\u00a0in) long and 60\u00a0cm (24\u00a0in) in circumference at its widest point. Smaller-sized balls are used for junior versions of the game, such as \"Mini\" and \"Mod\". A full size ball weighs between 383 and 440\u00a0g (13.5 and 15.5\u00a0oz). Rugby league footballs are slightly more pointed than rugby union footballs and larger than American footballs.  Both the Australian National Rugby League and the Super League use balls made by Steeden. Steeden is also sometimes used as a noun to describe the ball itself.[11] "},{"title":"Referee (association football)","content":"  In association football, the referee is the person responsible for interpreting and enforcing the Laws of the Game during a match.  The referee is the final decision-making authority on all facts connected with play, and is the match official with the authority to start and stop play and impose disciplinary action against players and coaches during a match.[1]  At most levels of play, the referee is assisted by two assistant referees (formerly known as linesmen), who advise the referee on whether the ball leaves the playing area and any infringements of the Laws of the Game occurring outside of the view of the referee. The final decision on any decision of fact rests with the referee, who has authority to overrule an assistant referee. At higher levels of play, the referee may also be assisted by a fourth official who supervises the teams' technical areas and assists the referee with administrative tasks, and, at the very highest levels, additional assistant referees and\/or video assistant referees. Referees and other game officials are licensed and trained by its member national organisations.  The referee's powers and duties are described by Law 5 of the Laws of the Game.[2] The referee:  As well as other various duties and powers described fully in Law 5 of the Laws of the Game, pursuant to current updates.   Referees and assistant referees are regulated at a national level. FIFA requires that each national organisation establish a referees committee composed of former officials that has authority over refereeing in that territory.[3] FIFA also mandate that referees pass tests to show sufficient physical fitness and knowledge of the Laws of the Game, as well as an annual medical.[3] Generally, referees are required to have greater experience to officiate higher level matches (see, for example, the multiple tiers of refereeing in England). The most elite officials, those who are permitted to officiate international games, are listed on the FIFA International Referees List. Referees wear a kit distinguishing themselves from the players. Usually this comprises  a shirt of a different colour to the players of both teams.   In the early 20th century, referees wore a blazer rather than a shirt similar to that of the players. Traditionally that uniform was almost always all black, unless one of the teams was wearing a very dark shirt in which case the referee would wear another colour (usually red) to distinguish themself from both teams.   At the 1994 World Cup finals, new shirts were introduced that gave officials a choice of burgundy, yellow or white, and at the same time the creation of the Premier League in England saw referees wear green jerseys: both changes were motivated by television considerations. Since then, most referees have worn either yellow or black, but the colours and styles adopted by individual associations vary greatly. For international contests under the supervision of FIFA, Adidas uniforms are worn because Adidas is the current sponsor. FIFA allows referees to wear five colours: black, red, yellow, green and blue. Along with the jersey, referees are required to wear black shorts, black socks (with white stripes in some cases), and black shoes.  The badge, which displays the referee's license level and year of validity, is often affixed to the left chest pocket.  All referees carry a whistle, a watch, penalty cards, a data wallet with pen and paper, and a coin for determining which team has the choice of ends or kick-off. Most are encouraged to have more than one of each on them in case they drop a whistle or a pen runs out and so on. Often, referees use two watches so that they can use one to calculate time lost for stoppages for the purposes of added time. At the highest levels, referees wear a full duplex radio with customised headset to communicate between with their assistants, and assistant referees use electronic flags, which send a signal to the referee when a button is pushed.[4][5] In matches with goal-line technology, referees will have on their person a device to receive the system's alerts.[6]  Referees use a whistle to help them control matches. The whistle is sometimes needed to stop, start or restart play but should not be used for all stoppages, starts or restarts. FIFA's Laws of the Game document gives guidance as to when the whistle should and should not be used.[7] Overuse of the whistle is discouraged since, as stated in the Laws, \"A whistle which is used too frequently unnecessarily will have less impact when it is needed.\"[7] The whistle is an important tool for the referee along with verbal, body and eye communication.  Before the introduction of the whistle, referees indicated their decisions by waving a white handkerchief. The whistles that were first adopted by referees were made by Joseph Hudson at Mills Munitions in Birmingham, England. The Acme Whistle Company (based at Mills Munitions Factory) first began to mass-produce pea whistles in the 1870s for the Metropolitan Police Force. It is frequently stated the referee's whistle was first used in a game between Nottingham Forest and Sheffield Norfolk in 1878; however the last such fixture known to have taken place between the two clubs was in 1874. The Nottingham Forest account book of 1872 apparently recorded the purchase of an \"umpire's whistle\" and in 1928 an article by R M Ruck about his playing days in the early 1870s referred to the use of a whistle by umpires to indicate an infringement.[8]  The whistle was not mentioned in the Laws of the Game until 1936 when an IFAB Decision was added as footnote (b) to Law 2, stating \"A Referee's control over the players for misconduct or ungentlemanly behaviour commences from the time he enters the field of play, but his jurisdiction in connection with the Laws of the Game commences from the time he blows his whistle for the game to start.\"[9]  In 2007, when IFAB greatly expanded the Laws of the Game, an Additional Instructions section became available, which is a full page of advice on how and when the whistle should be used as a communication and control mechanism by the referee.[10]  Referees in football were first described by Richard Mulcaster in 1581.[11]  In this description of \"foteball\" he advocates the use of a \"judge over the parties\".  In the modern era, referees are first advocated in English public school football games, notably Eton football in 1845.[12]  A match report from Rochdale in 1842 shows their use in a football game between the Bodyguards Club and the Fearnought Club.[12]  In the early years of the codified sport it was assumed that disputes could be adequately settled by discussion between gentlemen players who would never deliberately commit a foul.  However, as play became more competitive, the need for officials grew. Initially there existed two umpires, one per team, who could be appealed to with the referee (the game's timekeeper) being \"referred\" to if the umpires could not agree.[13]  The promotion of referees to the dominant position they occupy today, and the reformation of umpires into the linesmen role, occurred as part of a major restructuring of the laws in 1891.[13]  The predominant system of positioning and division of responsibility used by football match officials throughout the world is known as the Diagonal system of control (DSC).  The referee has final decision-making authority on all matters. The referee is assisted by two assistant referees who advise the referee. An assistant referee's judgement is enforced only if the referee accepts that judgement, and the referee has the authority to unilaterally overrule an assistant referee. The referee is the only official empowered with starting and stopping play, and meting out disciplinary actions such as cautions or send-offs.  The two assistant referees are instructed by the referee to each patrol half of a single touchline on opposite sides of the field. For example, on a field running north\u2013south, one assistant referee (AR) would run on the eastern touchline from the north goal line to the halfway line, while the other assistant referee would run on the western touchline from the south goal line to the halfway line. In general, the assistant referees' duties would be to indicate (using their flags) when an offside offence has occurred in their half, when a ball has left the pitch, and if a foul has been executed out of the view of the referee (typically in their quadrant of the field). Generally, the ARs will position themselves in line with either the second to last opponent or the ball \u2013 whichever is closer to the goal line \u2013 to better judge offside infractions. However, the assistant referee will have specific positioning with respect to corner kicks, penalty kicks, and throw-ins.  The referee patrols the length of the field to cover the ground not covered by their two assistants, generally running in a diagonal pattern from the southeast quadrant of the field towards the northwest quadrant; hence the term \"diagonal system of control\" (DSC). This pattern is not a specific route but a general guideline that should be modified to the style of play, nature of the game, the location of play at a given time, etc. In some cases the referee may even exit the field if it aids in their decision-making ability. The main idea is that the referee and assistants using the DSC should be able to position themselves quickly and easily to observe the important aspects of play (offside, ball in or out of play, goal-scoring opportunities, challenges for the ball) from multiple angles with multiple sets of eyes.  The description above refers to a left diagonal system of control, known as \"running a left\" or \"standard diagonal\". If, before the match, the centre referee on this field decides to run from southwest to northeast, then the assistants must position themselves accordingly and the result will be a right diagonal system of control, otherwise referred to as \"running a right\" or \"reverse diagonal\".  In many cases in England, referees use more of \"curve\" based on a line running from the edge of the 18-yard (16\u00a0m) box, and when near the centre circle they then curve to a line level with the other 18-yard (16\u00a0m) box line. This is similar to the diagonal system, but with the speed of modern football it is easier to keep up with play. This also helps the referee avoid being in a common \"passing lane\" through the centre circle itself.  In international matches the left-wing diagonal shown above has been universal since the 1960s. It is now predominant across the world. England until recently was an exception to this convention. Until 1974 referees in the Football League were required to run both diagonals during a match, most opting to run from right wing to right wing in the first half before switching to the left-wing diagonal for the second half. The chief reason for this alternation was to avoid linesmen wearing down the same part of the touchline during matches \u2013 this was important given the generally lower quality of pitches at the time. However switching diagonal was also justified in terms of allowing officials to patrol different areas of the field during games. From the 1974\u201375 season English referees were allowed to run the same diagonal throughout the same match. Most initially opted for the right-wing diagonal although over the years the left-wing diagonal became increasingly popular and the preferred choice of most referees by the early 2000s. From 2007\u201308 the left-wing diagonal has been mandatory in English professional football although some referees at lower levels still use the opposite approach.  Its implementation as a standard practice for referees is attributed to Sir Stanley Rous, former referee and President of FIFA from 1961 to 1974.[14]  While the Laws of the Game mandate a single referee with assistants as described above, other systems are used experimentally or explicitly by some non-FIFA-affiliated governing organizations.  The dual system, has two referees with no assistants.[15] The system is used some matches played under the rules of the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) in the United States, and in other youth or amateur matches. Both referees have equal authority, and the decision of one referee is binding on the other. Each referee is primarily responsible for a specific area of the field similar to those of the assistant referees in the diagonal system, except that the referees are allowed and encouraged to move away from the touch line into the field, particularly as play approaches the goal lines. Like the assistant referees in the diagonal system, each referee is responsible for patrolling one touch line and one goal line and determining possession for the restart if the ball goes out of play on either of those two boundaries.[16]  Positioning in the dual system is similar to that used by officials in basketball: each referee is either termed the \"lead\" or the \"trail\", depending on the direction of the attack. If the attack is against the goal to the referee's right (when facing the field from their assigned touch line), then that referee is the lead, and the other is the trail. The lead is positioned ahead of the play, even with the second-to-last defender to the extent possible, while the trail is positioned behind the play. Both are responsible for calling fouls and misconduct and determining the restart when the ball goes out of play on one of their assigned boundary lines. Since the lead is in a better position to determine offside, the lead is responsible for calling offside, while the trail provides an extra monitor for fouls and misconduct while the lead's attention is focused on offside. When the attack changes direction, the trail becomes the lead and vice versa.[16]  The double dual system uses three referees, all equipped with whistles, positioned much as in the traditional diagonal system of control mandated by IFAB.[17]  Each referee has the same authority for decision making.[18] It is authorized in the United States for college and high school matches although it is rarely used. "},{"title":"Laws of the Game (association football)","content":"  The Laws of the Game are the codified rules of association football. The laws mention the number of players a team should have, the game length, the size of the field and ball, the type and nature of fouls that referees may penalise, the offside law, and many other laws that define the sport. During a match, it is the task of the referee to interpret and enforce the Laws of the Game.  There were various attempts to codify rules among the various types of football in the mid-19th century. The extant Laws date back to 1863 where a ruleset was formally adopted by the newly formed Football Association (FA) and written by its first secretary, Ebenezer Cobb Morley. Over time, the Laws have been amended, and since 1886 they have been maintained by the International Football Association Board (IFAB).  The Laws are the only rules of association football FIFA permits its members to use.[1] The Laws currently allow some minor optional variations which can be implemented by national football associations, including some for play at the lowest levels, but otherwise almost all organised football worldwide is played under the same ruleset. Within the United States, Major League Soccer used a distinct ruleset during the 1990s[2] and the National Federation of State High School Associations and National Collegiate Athletic Association still use rulesets that are comparable to, but different from, the IFAB Laws.[3]  The Laws of the Game consist of seventeen individual laws, each law containing several rules and directions:[4]  All high-level association football is played according to the same laws. The Laws permit some variation for youth, veterans, disability and grassroots football, such as shortening the length of the game and the use of temporary dismissals.[4]  In 1997, a major revision dropped whole paragraphs and clarified many sections to simplify and strengthen the principles. These laws are written in English Common Law style and are meant to be guidelines and goals of principle that are then clarified through practice, tradition, and enforcement by the referees.  The actual law book had long contained 50 pages more of material, organised in numerous sections, that included many diagrams but were not officially part of the main 17 laws. In 2007, many of these additional sections along with much of the material from the FIFA Questions and Answers (Q&A), were restructured and put into a new \"Additional Instructions and Guidelines for the Referee\" section. In the 2016\/2017 revision of the Laws, the material from this section was folded into the Laws themselves.  Referees are expected to use their judgement and common sense in applying the laws; this is colloquially known as \"Law 18\".[5]  The laws are administered by the International Football Association Board (IFAB). They meet at least once a year to debate and decide any changes to the text as it exists at that time. The meeting in winter generally leads to an update to the laws on 1 July of each year that take effect immediately. The laws govern all international matches and national matches of member organisations.[6] A minimum of six of the eight-seat IFAB board needs to vote to accept a rule change. Four seats are held by FIFA to represent their 200+ member Nations, with the other four going to each of the British associations (the FA representing England, the SFA representing Scotland, FAW representing Wales and the IFA representing Northern Ireland), meaning that no change can be made without FIFA's approval, but FIFA cannot change the Laws without the approval of at least two of the British governing bodies.[6]  In the nineteenth century, the word \"football\" could signify a wide variety of games in which players attempted to move a ball into an opponent's goal.  The first published rules of \"football\" were those of Rugby School (1845), which permitted extensive handling, quickly followed by the Eton field game (1847), which was much more restrictive of handling the ball. Between the 1830s and 1850s, a number of sets of rules were created for use at Cambridge University \u2013 but they were generally not published at the time, and many have subsequently been lost.  The first detailed sets of rules published by football clubs (rather than a school or university) were those of Sheffield F.C. (written 1858, published 1859) which codified a game played for 20 years until being discontinued in favour of the Football Association code, and those of Melbourne FC (1859) which are the origins of Australian rules football. By the time the Football Association met in late 1863, many different sets of rules had been published, varying widely on such questions as the extent to which the ball could be handled, the treatment of offside, the amount of physical contact allowed with opponents, and the height at which a goal could be scored.  In 1863, some football clubs followed the example of Rugby School by allowing the ball to be carried in the hands, with players allowed to \"hack\" (kick in the shins) opponents who were carrying the ball. Other clubs forbade both practices.  During the FA meetings to draw up the first version of the laws, there was an acrimonious division between the \"hacking\" and \"non-hacking\" clubs. An FA meeting of 17 November 1863 discussed this question, with the \"hacking\" clubs predominating.[7] A further meeting was scheduled in order to finalise (\"settle\") the laws.[8] At this crucial 24 November meeting, the \"hackers\" were again in a narrow majority. During the meeting, however, the FA's secretary Ebenezer Cobb Morley brought the delegates' attention to a recently published set of football laws from Cambridge University which banned carrying and hacking.[8] Discussion of the Cambridge rules, and suggestions for possible communication with Cambridge on the subject, served to delay the final \"settlement\" of the laws to a further meeting, on 1 December.[9][10] A number of representatives who supported rugby-style football did not attend this additional meeting,[11] resulting in hacking and carrying being banned.[10]  Francis Campbell of Blackheath F.C., the most prominent \"hacking\" club, accused FA President Arthur Pember, Morley, and their allies of managing 24 November meeting improperly in order to prevent the \"pro-hacking\" laws from being adopted.[12] Pember strongly denied such an \"accusation of ungentlemanly conduct\".  The verdicts of later historians have been mixed:  Young accuses Campbell of \"arrogance\",[13] while Harvey supports Campbell's allegations, accusing the non-hackers of a \"coup\" against the pro-hacking clubs.[14] Blackheath, along with the other \"hacking\" clubs, would leave the FA as a result of this dispute.  The final version of the FA's laws was formally adopted and published in December 1863.  Some notable differences from the modern game are listed below:  At its meeting on 8 December 1863, the FA agreed that, as reported in Bell's Life in London, John Lillywhite would publish the Laws.[15] The first game to be played under the new rules occurred eleven days later between Barnes and Richmond.[15] Adoption of the laws was not universal among English football clubs. The Sheffield Rules continued to be used by many. Additionally, in preference for hacking as well as handling of the ball, several clubs, such as Blackheath, decided against being part of the FA in its early years and would later form the Rugby Football Union in 1871.[16]  Minor variations between the rules used in England (the jurisdiction of the Football Association) and the other Home Nations of the United Kingdom \u2013 Scotland, Wales and Ireland \u2013 led to the creation of the International Football Association Board to oversee the rules for all the home nations. Their first meeting was in 1886.[17] Before this, teams from different countries had to agree to which country's rules were used before playing.  When the international football body on the continent FIFA was founded in Paris in 1904, it immediately declared that FIFA would adhere to the rules laid down by the IFAB. The growing popularity of the international game led to the admittance of FIFA representatives to the IFAB in 1913. Up until 1958, it was still possible for the British associations to vote together to impose changes against the wishes of FIFA. This changed with the adoption of the current voting system whereby FIFA's support is necessary, but not sufficient, for any amendment to pass.[6]  Notable amendments to the rules include:[16][18]  The 1938 rewriting of the laws introduced the scheme of 17 named laws that has lasted until today, with only minor alterations.  The history of the numbering and titles of the laws since 1938 is shown in the table below:  Notes "},{"title":"FIFA","content":"  The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration internationale de football association (French for 'International Association Football Federation';[3] abbreviated as FIFA and pronounced in English as \/\u02c8fi\u02d0f\u0259\/ FEE-f\u0259) is an international self-regulatory governing body of association football, beach soccer, and futsal. It was founded in 1904[4] to oversee international competition among the national associations of Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain (represented by the Madrid Football Club), Sweden, and Switzerland. Headquartered in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, its membership now comprises 211 national associations. These national associations must also be members of one of the six regional confederations into which the world is divided: CAF (Africa), AFC (Asia and Australia), UEFA (Europe), CONCACAF (North & Central America and the Caribbean), OFC (Oceania), and CONMEBOL (South America).  FIFA outlines several objectives in its organizational statutes, including growing association football internationally, providing efforts to ensure it is accessible to everyone, and advocating for integrity and fair play.[5] It is responsible for the organization and promotion of association football's major international tournaments, notably the World Cup which commenced in 1930, and the Women's World Cup which began in 1991. Although FIFA does not solely set the laws of the game, that being the responsibility of the International Football Association Board of which FIFA is a member, it applies and enforces the rules across all FIFA competitions.[6] All FIFA tournaments generate revenue from sponsorships; in 2022, FIFA had revenues of over US $5.8\u00a0billion, ending the 2019\u20132022 cycle with a net positive of US$1.2\u00a0billion, and cash reserves of over US$3.9\u00a0billion.[7]  Reports by investigative journalists have linked FIFA leadership with corruption, bribery, and vote-rigging related to the election of FIFA president Sepp Blatter and the organization's decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar, respectively. These allegations led to the indictments of nine high-ranking FIFA officials and five corporate executives by the U.S. Department of Justice on charges including racketeering, wire fraud, and money laundering. On 27 May 2015, several of these officials were arrested by Swiss authorities, who launched a simultaneous but separate criminal investigation into how the organization awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Those among these officials who were also indicted in the U.S. are expected to be extradited to face charges there as well.[8][9][10]  Many officials were suspended by FIFA's ethics committee including Sepp Blatter[11] and Michel Platini.[12] In early 2017, reports became public about FIFA president Gianni Infantino attempting to prevent the re-elections[13] of both chairmen of the ethics committee, Cornel Borb\u00e9ly and Hans-Joachim Eckert, during the FIFA congress in May 2017.[14][15] On 9 May 2017, following Infantino's proposal,[16] FIFA Council decided not to renew the mandates of Borb\u00e9ly and Eckert.[16] Together with the chairmen, 11 of 13 committee members were removed. FIFA has been suspected of corruption regarding the Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup.[17]  The need for a single body to oversee association football became increasingly apparent at the beginning of the 20th century with the increasing popularity of international fixtures. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was founded in the rear of the headquarters of the Union des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Fran\u00e7aises de Sports Athl\u00e9tiques (USFSA) at the Rue Saint Honor\u00e9 229 in Paris on 21 May 1904.[18] The French name and acronym are universally adopted outside French-speaking countries. The founding members were the national associations of Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Spain (represented by then-Real Madrid CF; the Royal Spanish Football Federation was not created until 1913), Sweden and Switzerland.  On the same day, the German Football Association (DFB) declared its intention to affiliate through a telegram.[1]  The first president of FIFA was Robert Gu\u00e9rin. Gu\u00e9rin was replaced in 1906 by Daniel Burley Woolfall from England, by then a member of the association. The first tournament FIFA staged, the association football competition for the 1908 Olympics in London was more successful than its Olympic predecessors, despite the presence of professional footballers, contrary to the founding principles of FIFA.[19][20][21][22]  Membership of FIFA expanded beyond Europe with the application of South Africa in 1909, Argentina in 1912, Canada and Chile in 1913, and the United States in 1914.[23]  The 1912 Spalding Athletic Library \"Official Guide\" includes information on the 1912 Olympics (scores and stories), AAFA, and FIFA. The 1912 FIFA President was Dan B Woolfall.[24] Daniel Burley Woolfall was president from 1906 to 1918.[25]  During World War I, with many players sent off to war and the possibility of travel for international fixtures severely limited, the organization's survival was in doubt. Post-war, following the death of Woolfall, the organization was run by Dutchman Carl Hirschmann. It was saved from extinction but at the cost of the withdrawal of the Home Nations (of the United Kingdom), who cited an unwillingness to participate in international competitions with their World War enemies. The Home Nations later resumed their membership. The FIFA collection is held by the National Football Museum at Urbis in Manchester, England.[26] The first World Cup was held in 1930 in Montevideo, Uruguay.[26]  The FIFA flag is blue, with the organization's wordmark logo in the middle. The current FIFA flag was first flown during the 2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony in Moscow, Russia.[27]  Akin to the UEFA Champions League, FIFA has adopted an anthem composed by the German composer Franz Lambert since the 1994 FIFA World Cup. It has been re-arranged and produced by Rob May and Simon Hill.[28][29] The FIFA Anthem is played at the beginning of official FIFA sanctioned matches and tournaments such as international friendlies, the FIFA World Cup, FIFA Women's World Cup, FIFA U-20 World Cup, FIFA U-17 World Cup, Football at the Summer Olympics, FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup, FIFA Women's U-17 World Cup, FIFA Futsal World Cup, FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup and FIFA Club World Cup.[30]  Since 2007, FIFA has also required most of its broadcast partners to use short sequences including the anthem at the beginning and end of FIFA event coverage and for break bumpers to help promote FIFA's sponsors. This emulates practices long used by international football events, such as the UEFA Champions League. Exceptions may be made for specific circumstances; for example, an original piece of African music was used for bumpers during the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[31]    Besides its worldwide institutions, there are six confederations recognized by FIFA which oversee the game in the different continents and regions of the world. National associations, and not the continental confederations, are members of FIFA. The continental confederations are provided for in FIFA's statutes, and membership of a union is a prerequisite to FIFA membership.  In total, FIFA recognizes 211 national associations and their associated men's national teams as well as 129 women's national teams; see the list of national football teams and their respective country codes. The number of FIFA member associations is higher than the number of UN member states as FIFA has admitted associations from 23 non-sovereign entities as members in their own right, such as the four Home Nations within the United Kingdom and the two special administrative regions of China: Hong Kong and Macau.  On 28 February 2022, FIFA suspended Russia from all competitions due to controversy surrounding Russia's invasion of Ukraine.[32]  FIFA can suspend countries due to numerous multifaceted issues. Common reasons include governance interference, corruption, and financial irregularities. Doping or the misappropriation of drugs is also a consideration for expulsion.  The FIFA Men's World Rankings are updated monthly and rank each team based on their performance in international competitions, qualifiers, and friendly matches. There is also a world ranking for women's football, amended on a quarterly schedule.  FIFA's headquarters is in Z\u00fcrich, and it is an association established under the law of Switzerland.  FIFA's supreme body is the FIFA Congress, an assembly of representatives from each affiliated member association. Each national football association has one vote, regardless of size or footballing strength. The Congress assembles in ordinary sessions once every year, and extraordinary sessions have been held once a year since 1998. Congress makes decisions relating to FIFA's governing statutes and their method of implementation and application. Only Congress can pass changes to FIFA's statutes. The congress approves the annual report and decides on the acceptance of new national associations, and holds elections. Congress elects the President of FIFA, its general secretary, and the other members of the FIFA Council in the year following the FIFA World Cup.[33]  FIFA Council \u2013 formerly called the FIFA Executive Committee and chaired by the president \u2013 is the organization's main decision-making body in the intervals of Congress. The council comprises 37 people: the president; 8 vice-presidents; and 28 members from the confederations, with at least one of them being a woman. The executive committee is the body that decides which country will host the World Cup.  The president and the general secretary are the main office holders of FIFA and are in charge of its daily administration, carried in by the general secretariat, with its staff of approximately 280 members. Gianni Infantino is the current president, elected on 26 February 2016 at an extraordinary FIFA Congress session after former president Sepp Blatter was suspended pending a corruption investigation.[34][35]  FIFA's worldwide organizational structure also consists of several other bodies under the authority of the FIFA Council or created by Congress as standing committees. Among those bodies are the FIFA Emergency Committee, the FIFA Ethics Committee, the Finance Committee, the Disciplinary Committee, and the Referees Committee.  The FIFA Emergency Committee deals with all matters requiring immediate settlement in the time frame between the regular meetings of the FIFA Council.[36][37] The Emergency Committee consists of the FIFA president as well as one member from each confederation.[38] Emergency Committee decisions made are immediately put into legal effect, although they need to be ratified at the next Executive Committee meeting.[39]  FIFA publishes its results according to International Financial Reporting Standards. The total compensation for the management committee in 2011 was 30 million for 35 people. Blatter, the only full-time person on the committee, earned approximately two million Swiss francs, 1.2 million in salary, and the rest in bonuses.[40][41][42] A report in London's The Sunday Times in June 2014 said the members of the committee had their salaries doubled from $100,000 to $200,000 during the year. The report also said leaked documents had indicated $4.4 million in secret bonuses had been paid to the committee members following the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.[43]  The laws that govern football known officially as the Laws of the Game, are not solely the responsibility of FIFA; they are maintained by a body called the International Football Association Board (IFAB). FIFA has members on its board (four representatives); the other four are provided by the football associations of the United Kingdom: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, who jointly established IFAB in 1882 and are recognized for the creation and history of the game. Changes to the Laws of the Game must be agreed upon by at least six delegates.  The FIFA Statutes form the overarching document guiding FIFA's governing system. The governing system is divided into separate bodies with the appropriate powers to create a system of checks and balances. It consists of four general bodies: the Congress, the executive committee, the general Secretariat, and standing and ad hoc committees.[44]  FIFA frequently takes active roles in the running of the sport and developing the game around the world. One of its sanctions is to suspend teams and associated members from international competition when a government interferes in the running of FIFA's associate member organizations or if the associate is not functioning correctly.  A 2007 FIFA ruling that a player can be registered with a maximum of three clubs and appear in official matches for a maximum of two in a year measured from 1 July to 30 June has led to controversy, especially in those countries whose seasons cross that date barrier, as in the case of two former Ireland internationals. As a direct result of this controversy, FIFA modified this ruling the following year to accommodate transfers between leagues with out-of-phase seasons.  FIFA now permits the use of video evidence during matches, as well as for subsequent sanctions. However, for most of FIFA's history it stood opposed to its use.[45] The 1970 meeting of the International Football Association Board \"agreed to request the television authorities to refrain from any slow-motion play-back which reflected, or might reflect, adversely on any decision of the referee\".[46] As recently as 2008 FIFA president Sepp Blatter said: \"Let it be as it is and let's leave [football] with errors. The television companies will have the right to say [the referee] was right or wrong, but still, the referee makes the decision \u2013 a man, not a machine.\"[47] This stance was finally overturned on 3 March 2018, when the IFAB wrote video assistant referees (also known as VARs) into the Laws of the Game permanently.[48] Their use remains optional for competitions.  In early July 2012 FIFA sanctioned the use of goal-line technology, subject to rules specified by the International Football Association Board (IFAB), who had officially approved its use by amending the Laws of the Game to permit (but not require) its use.[49][50] This followed a high-profile incident during a second-round game in the 2010 FIFA World Cup between England and Germany, where a shot by Englishman Frank Lampard, which would have levelled the scores at 2\u20132 in a match that ultimately ended in a 4\u20131 German victory, crossed the line but was not seen to do so by the match officials, which led FIFA officials to declare that they would re-examine the use of goal-line technology.[51]  On 28 February 2022, due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and by a recommendation by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), FIFA suspended the participation of Russia.[52][53]  The Russian Football Union unsuccessfully appealed the FIFA ban to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which upheld the ban.[54] Some observers, while approving of the boycott of Russia, have pointed out that FIFA did not boycott Saddam Hussein's Iraq as an aggressor during the Iran\u2013Iraq War,[55] Saudi Arabia for its military intervention in Yemen,[56] Qatar for its human rights violations,[57][58] or the United States for the actions of the U.S. military during the Iraq War.[59] However, this full ban was partially lifted in October 2023 when it was decided that their men's and women's U-17 teams were allowed to return to international competitions.   FIFA previously banned Indonesia due to government intervention within the team. FIFA requires members to play \"with no influence from third parties\".[60]  FIFA holds an annual awards ceremony, The Best FIFA Football Awards since 2016, which recognizes both individual and team achievements in international association football. Individually, the top men's player is awarded The Best FIFA Men's Player, and the top women's player is The Best FIFA Women's Player. Other prominent awards are The Best FIFA Football Coach and FIFA FIFPro World11.  In 2000, FIFA presented two awards, FIFA Club of the Century and FIFA Player of the Century, to decide the greatest football club and player of the 20th century. Real Madrid was the club winner, while Diego Maradona and Pel\u00e9 were the joint player's winners.

The Secret World of FIFA: Bribes, Vote-Rigging, and Ticket Scandals (HarperCollins) caused controversy within the football world by detailing an alleged international cash-for-contracts scandal following the collapse of FIFA's marketing partner International Sport and Leisure (ISL) and revealed how some football officials had been urged to secretly repay the sweeteners they received. The book also alleged that vote-rigging had occurred in the fight for Sepp Blatter's continued control of FIFA as the organization's president. Shortly after the release of Foul! a BBC Panorama expos\u00e9 by Jennings and BBC producer Roger Corke, screened on 11 June 2006, reported that Blatter was being investigated by Swiss police over his role in a secret deal to repay more than \u00a31m worth of bribes pocketed by football officials. Lord Triesman, the former chairman of the English Football Association, described FIFA as an organization that \"behaves like a mafia family,\" highlighting the organization's \"decades-long traditions of bribes, bungs, and corruption\".[96]  All testimonies offered in the Panorama expos\u00e9 were provided through a disguised voice, appearance, or both, save one: Mel Brennan, a former CONCACAF official, became the first high-level football insider to go public with substantial allegations of corruption, nonfeasance, and malfeasance by CONCACAF and FIFA leadership. Brennan\u2014the highest-level African-American in the history of world football governance\u2014joined Jennings, Trinidadian journalist Lisana Liburd, and many others in exposing allegedly inappropriate allocations of money by CONCACAF and drew connections between ostensible CONCACAF criminality and similar behaviours at FIFA. Since then, and in the light of fresh allegations of corruption by FIFA in late 2010,[97] both Jennings and Brennan remain highly critical of FIFA. Brennan has called directly for an alternative to FIFA to be considered by the stakeholders of the sport worldwide.[98]  In a further Panorama expos\u00e9 broadcast on 29 November 2010, Jennings alleged that three senior FIFA officials, Nicolas Leoz, Issa Hayatou and Ricardo Teixeira, had been paid huge bribes by ISL between 1989 and 1999, which FIFA had failed to investigate. Jennings claimed they appeared on a list of 175 bribes paid by ISL, totalling about $100 million. A former ISL executive said there were suspicions within the company that they were only awarded the marketing contract for successive World Cups by paying bribes to FIFA officials. The program also alleged that another current official, Jack Warner, has been repeatedly involved in reselling World Cup tickets to touts; Blatter said that FIFA had not investigated the allegation because it had not been told about it via 'official channels.'  Panorama also alleged that FIFA requires nations bidding to host the World Cup to agree to implement special laws, including a blanket tax exemption for FIFA and its corporate sponsors and limitation of workers rights. Contrary to FIFA's demands, these conditions were revealed by the Dutch government, resulting in them being told by FIFA that their bid could be adversely affected. Following Jennings' earlier investigations, he was banned from all FIFA press conferences for reasons he claimed had not been made clear. The accused officials failed to answer questions about his latest allegations verbally or by letter.  Prime Minister David Cameron and Andy Anson, head of England's World Cup bid, criticized the timing of the broadcast three days before FIFA decided on the host for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, because it might damage England's bid; the voters included officials accused by the program.[99][100]  In June 2011, it came to light that the International Olympic Committee had started inquiry proceedings against FIFA honorary president Jo\u00e3o Havelange into claims of bribery. Panorama alleged that Havelange accepted a $1\u00a0million 'bung' in 1997 from ISL. The IOC stated that it \"takes all allegations of corruption very seriously, and we would always ask for any evidence of wrongdoing involving any IOC members to be passed to our ethics commission\".[101]  In a 2014 interview, American sportswriter Dave Zirin said that corruption is endemic to FIFA leadership and that the organization should be abolished for the game's good. He said that currently, FIFA is in charge of both monitoring corruption in association football matches and marketing and selling the sport, but that two \"separate\" organizational bodies are needed: an organizational body that monitors corruption and match-fixing and the like and an organization that's responsible for marketing and sponsorships and selling the sport. Zirin said the idea of having a single organization responsible for both seems highly ineffective and detrimental to the sport.[102]  In May 2015, 14 people were arrested, including nine FIFA officials, after being accused of corruption.[103]  In the 2022 World Cup bid, Qatar was honoured to host the World Cup.  Since then it has been discovered that Qatar paid as much as 200 billion dollars to host the World Cup. This information was discovered by the Tass news agency in Russia.[104]  Between 2013 and 2015 four individuals, and two sports television rights corporations pleaded guilty to United States financial misconduct charges. The pleas of Chuck Blazer, Jos\u00e9 Hawilla, Daryan Warner, Darrell Warner, Traffic Group and Traffic Sports USA were unsealed in May 2015.[9] In another 2015 case, Singapore also imposed a 6-year \"harshest sentence ever received for match-fixing\" on match-fixer Eric Ding who had bribed three Lebanese FIFA football officials with prostitutes as an inducement to fix future matches that they would officiate, as well as perverting the course of justice.[105]  Fourteen FIFA officials and marketing executives were indicted by the United States Department of Justice in May 2015. The officials were arrested in Switzerland and are in the process of extradition to the US. Specific charges (brought under the RICO act) include wire fraud, racketeering, and money laundering.[106]  \"Swiss authorities say they have also opened a separate criminal investigation into FIFA's operations pertaining to the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids\".[107]  FIFA's top officials were arrested at a hotel in Switzerland on suspicion of receiving bribes totalling $100m (\u00a365m). The US Department of Justice stated that nine FIFA officials and four executives of sports management companies were arrested and accused of over $150m in bribes.[108] The UK Shadow Home Secretary and Labour Member of Parliament, Andy Burnham, stated in May 2015 that England should boycott the 2018 World Cup against corruption in FIFA and military aggression by Russia.[109]  FIFA's choice to award the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 World Cup to Qatar has been widely criticized by media.[110][111][112][113] It has been alleged that some FIFA inside sources insist that the Russian kickbacks of cash and gifts given to FIFA executive members were enough to secure the Russian 2018 bid weeks before the result was announced.[114] Sepp Blatter was widely criticized in the media for giving a warning about the \"evils of the media\" in a speech to FIFA executive committee members shortly before they voted on the hosting of the 2018 World Cup, a reference to The Sunday Times expos\u00e9s,[115] and the Panorama investigation.[116]  Two members of FIFA's executive committee were banned from all football-related activity in November 2010 for allegedly offering to sell their votes to undercover newspaper reporters. In early May 2011, a British parliamentary inquiry into why England failed to secure the 2018 finals was told by a member of parliament, Damian Collins, that there was evidence from The Sunday Times newspaper that Issa Hayatou of Cameroon and Jacques Anouma of Ivory Coast were paid by Qatar. Qatar has categorically denied the allegations, as have Hayatou and Anouma.[117]  FIFA president Blatter said, as of 23\u00a0May\u00a02011[update], that the British newspaper The Sunday Times has agreed to bring its whistle-blowing source to meet senior FIFA officials, who will decide whether to order a new investigation into alleged World Cup bidding corruption. \"[The Sunday Times] are happy, they agreed that they will bring this whistleblower here to Z\u00fcrich and then we will have a discussion, an investigation of this\", Blatter said.  Specifically, the whistle-blower claims that FIFA executive committee members Issa Hayatou and Jacques Anouma were paid $1.5\u00a0million to vote for Qatar.[118][119] The emirate's bid beat the United States in a final round of voting last December. Blatter did not rule out reopening the 2022 vote if corruption could be proved, but urged taking the matter \"step by step\". The FIFA president said his organization is \"anxiously awaiting\" more evidence before asking its ethics committee to examine allegations made in Britain's Parliament in early May 2011.  Hayatou, who is from Cameroon, leads the Confederation of African Football and is a FIFA vice-president. Anouma is president of Ivorian Football Federation. The whistle-blower said Qatar agreed to pay a third African voter, Amos Adamu, for his support. The Nigerian was later suspended from voting after a FIFA ethics court ruled he solicited bribes from undercover Sunday Times reporters posing as lobbyists. Blatter said the newspaper and its whistle-blower would meet with FIFA secretary general, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Valcke, and legal director, Marco Villiger.  Allegations against FIFA officials have also been made to the UK Parliament by David Triesman, the former head of England's bid and the English Football Association. Triesman told the lawmakers that four long-standing FIFA executive committee members\u2014Jack Warner, Nicol\u00e1s Leoz, Ricardo Teixeira and Worawi Makudi\u2014engaged in \"improper and unethical\" conduct in the 2018 bidding, which was won by Russia. All six FIFA voters have denied wrongdoing.[120]  On 28 September 2015, Sepp Blatter suggested that the 2018 World Cup being awarded to Russia was planned before the voting, and that the 2022 World Cup would have then been awarded to the United States. However, this plan changed after the election ballot, and the 2022 World Cup was awarded to Qatar instead of the U.S.[121][122]  According to leaked documents seen by The Sunday Times, Qatari state-run television channel Al Jazeera secretly offered $400\u00a0million to FIFA, for broadcasting rights, just 21 days before FIFA announced that Qatar would hold the 2022 World Cup.[123][124]  On 17 July 2012, in the wake of announced anti-corruption reforms by Sepp Blatter, the president of the FIFA,[125] the organization appointed U.S. lawyer Michael J. Garcia as the chairman of the investigative chamber of FIFA Ethics Committee, while German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert was appointed as the chairman of the Ethics Committee's adjudication chamber.[126]  In August 2012, Garcia declared his intention to investigate the bidding process and decision to respectively award the right to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup to Russia and Qatar by the FIFA Executive Committee.[127] Garcia delivered his subsequent 350-page report in September 2014, and Eckert then announced that it would not be made public for legal reasons.[128]  On 13 November 2014, Eckert released a 42-page summary of his findings after reviewing Garcia's report. The summary cleared both Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing during the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups,[129] leaving Russia and Qatar free to stage their respective World Cups.[130]  FIFA welcomed \"the fact that a degree of closure has been reached\", while the Associated Press wrote that the Eckert summary \"was denounced by critics as a whitewash\".[130] Hours after the Eckert summary was released, Garcia himself criticized it for being \"materially incomplete\" with \"erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions\", while declaring his intention to appeal to FIFA's Appeal Committee.[129] On 16 December 2014, FIFA's Appeal Committee dismissed Garcia's appeal against the Eckert summary as \"not admissible\". FIFA also stated that Eckert's summary was \"neither legally binding nor appealable\".[131] A day later, Garcia resigned from his role as FIFA ethics investigator in protest of FIFA's conduct, citing a \"lack of leadership\" and lost confidence in the independence of Eckert from FIFA.[132] In June 2015, Swiss authorities claimed the report was of \"little value\".[133]  In November 2022, the FIFA officials told players not to get involved in politics but focus on sports when they are in Qatar.[134] A few weeks earlier, the football associations and players of Denmark and Australia criticized Qatar for this.[135][136]  FIFA announced on 25 May 2011 that it had opened the investigation to examine the conduct of four officials\u2014Mohamed Bin Hammam and Jack Warner, along with Caribbean Football Union (CFU) officials Debbie Minguell and Jason Sylvester\u2014in relation to claims made by executive committee member, Chuck Blazer.[137][138][139] Blazer, who was at the time, the general secretary of the CONCACAF confederation, has alleged that violations were committed under the FIFA code of ethics during a meeting organized by Bin Hammam and Warner on 10 and 11 May\u2014the same time Lord Triesman had accused Warner of demanding money for a World Cup 2018 vote\u2014in relation to the 2011 FIFA presidential election,[140] in which Bin Hammam, who also played a key role in the Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid, allegedly offered financial incentives for votes cast in his favour during the presidential election.  As a result of the investigation both Bin Hammam and Warner were suspended.[141] Warner reacted to his suspension by questioning Blatter's conduct and adding that FIFA secretary general, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Valcke, had told him via e-mail that Qatar had bought the 2022 World Cup.[142][143] Valcke subsequently issued a statement denying he had suggested it was bribery, saying instead that the country had \"used its financial muscle to lobby for support\". Qatar officials denied any impropriety.[144] Bin Hammam also responded by writing to FIFA, protesting unfair treatment in suspension by the FIFA Ethics Committee and FIFA administration.[145]  Further evidence emerged of alleged corruption. On 30 May 2011, Fred Lunn, vice-president of the Bahamas Football Association, said that he was given $40,000 in cash[146] as an incitement to vote for FIFA presidential candidate, Mohamed bin Hammam. In addition, on 11 June 2011 Louis Giskus, president of the Surinamese Football Association, alleged that he was given $40,000 in cash for \"development projects\" as an incentive to vote for Bin Hammam.[147]  After being re-elected as president of FIFA, Sepp Blatter responded to the allegations by promising to reform FIFA in wake of the bribery scandal, with Danny Jordaan, CEO of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, saying there is great expectation for reform.[148] Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger is being tipped for a role on the newly proposed 'Solutions Committee', and former Netherlands national football team player Johan Cruyff was also being linked with a role.[143][149]  UEFA secretary-general Gianni Infantino said he hopes for \"concrete\" measures to be taken by the world game's authority. Saying that \"the UEFA executive committee has taken note of the will of FIFA to take concrete and effective measures for good governance ... [and is] following the situation closely.\"[150]  IOC president Jacques Rogge commented on the situation by saying that he believes FIFA \"can emerge stronger\" from its worst-ever crisis, stating that \"I will not point a finger and lecture ... I am sure FIFA can emerge stronger and from within\".[151]  Several of FIFA's partners and sponsors have raised concerns about the allegations of corruption, including Coca-Cola, Adidas, Emirates and Visa.[152][153][154] Coca-Cola raised concerns by saying \"the current allegations being raised are distressing and bad for the sport\"; with Adidas saying \"the negative tenor of the public debate around Fifa at the moment is neither good for football nor for Fifa and its partners\"; moreover Emirates raised its concerns by saying \"we hope that these issues will be resolved as soon as possible\"; and Visa adding \"the current situation is clearly not good for the game and we ask that Fifa take all necessary steps to resolve the concerns that have been raised.\"[152]  Australian Sports Minister Mark Arbib said it was clear FIFA needed to change, saying \"there is no doubt there needs to be reform of FIFA. This is something that we're hearing worldwide\", with Australian Senator Nick Xenophon accusing FIFA of \"scamming\" the country out of the A$46\u00a0million (US$35\u00a0million) it spent on the Australia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid, saying that \"until the investigation into FIFA has been completed, Australia must hold off spending any more taxpayers' money on any future World Cup bids.\"[155]  Theo Zwanziger, president of the German Football Association, also called on FIFA to re-examine the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.[156]  Transparency International, which had called on FIFA to postpone the election pending a full independent investigation, renewed its call on FIFA to change its governance structure.[157]  Moreover, former Argentine football player Diego Maradona was critical of FIFA in light of the corruption scandal, comparing members of the board to dinosaurs. He said \"Fifa is a big museum. They are dinosaurs who do not want to relinquish power. It's always going to be the same.\"[158] In October 2011, Dick Pound criticized the organization, saying, \"FIFA has fallen far short of a credible demonstration that it recognizes the many problems it faces, that it has the will to solve them, that it is willing to be transparent about what it is doing and what it finds, and that its conduct in the future will be such that the public can be confident in the governance of the sport.\"[159]  In 2018, FIFA revised its code of ethics to remove corruption as one of the enumerated bases of ethical violations.[160] It retained bribery, misappropriation of funds and manipulation of competitions as offences, but added a statute of limitation clause that those offences could not be pursued after a ten-year period.[160]  The revision also made it an offence to make public statements of a defamatory nature against FIFA.[160] Alexandra Wrage, a former member of the FIFA governance committee and an expert in anti-bribery compliance, said that of the revision that \"the real value to FIFA is the chilling effect this will have on critics\".[160] "},{"title":"End zone","content":"The end zone is the scoring area on the field, according to gridiron-based codes of football. It is the area between the end line and goal line bounded by the sidelines.  There are two end zones, each being on the opposite side of the field. It is bordered on all sides by a white line indicating its beginning and end points, with orange, square pylons placed at each of the four corners as a visual aid (however, prior to around the early 1970s, flags were used instead to denote the end zone). Canadian rule books use the terms goal area and dead line instead of end zone and end line respectively, but the latter terms are the more common in colloquial Canadian English. Unlike sports like association football and ice hockey which require the ball\/puck to pass completely over the goal line to count as a score, both Canadian and American football merely need any part of the ball to break the vertical plane of the outer edge of the goal line.  A similar concept exists in both rugby football codes, where it is known as the in-goal area. The difference between rugby and gridiron-based codes is that in rugby, the ball must be touched to the ground in the in-goal area to count as a try (the rugby equivalent of a touchdown), whereas in the gridiron-based games, simply possessing the ball in or over the end zone is sufficient to count as a touchdown.  Ultimate frisbee also uses an end zone scoring area.  Scores in this sport are counted when a pass is received in the end zone.  The end zones were invented as a result of the legalization of the forward pass in gridiron football. Prior to this, the goal line and end line were the same, and players scored a touchdown by leaving the field of play through that line. Goal posts were placed on the goal line, and any kicks that did not result in field goals but left the field through the end lines were simply recorded as touchbacks (or, in the Canadian game, singles; it was during the pre-end zone era that Hugh Gall set the record for most singles in a game, with eight).  In the earliest days of the forward pass, the pass had to be caught in-bounds and could not be thrown across the goal line (as the receiver would be out of bounds). This also made it difficult to pass the ball when very close to one's own goal line, since merely dropping back to pass or kick would result in a safety (rules of the forward pass at the time required the passer to be five yards behind the line of scrimmage, which would make throwing the forward pass when the ball was snapped from behind one's own five-yard line illegal in itself).  Thus, in 1912, the end zone was introduced in American football. In an era when professional football was still in its early years and college football dominated the game, the resulting enlargement of the field was constrained by fact that many college teams were already playing in well-developed stadiums, complete with stands and other structures at the ends of the fields, thereby making any substantial enlargement of the field unfeasible at many schools. Eventually, a compromise was reached: 12 yards of end zone were added to each end of the field, but in return, the playing field was shortened from 110 yards to 100, resulting in the physical size of the field being only slightly longer than before. Goal posts were originally kept on the goal lines, but after they began to interfere with play, they moved back to the end lines in 1927, where they have remained in college football ever since. The National Football League moved the goal posts up to the goal line again in 1933, then back again to the end line in 1974.  As with many other aspects of gridiron football, Canadian football adopted the forward pass and end zones much later than American football.  The forward pass and end zones were adopted in 1929. In Canada, college football has never reached a level of prominence comparable to U.S. college football, and professional football was still in its infancy in the 1920s. As a result, Canadian football was still being played in rudimentary facilities in the late 1920s. A further consideration was that the Canadian Rugby Union (the governing body of Canadian football at the time, now known as Football Canada) wanted to reduce the prominence of single points (then called rouges) in the game. Therefore, the CRU simply appended 25-yard end zones to the ends of the existing 110-yard field, creating a much larger field of play. Since moving the goal posts back 25 yards would have made the scoring of field goals excessively difficult, and since the CRU did not want to reduce the prominence of field goals, the goal posts were left on the goal line where they remain today. However, the rules governing the scoring of singles were changed: teams were required to either kick the ball out of bounds through the end zone or force the opposition to down a kicked ball in their own end zone in order to be awarded a point. By 1986, at which point CFL stadiums were becoming bigger and comparable in development to their American counterparts in an effort to stay financially competitive, the CFL reduced the depth of the end zone to 20 yards.  A team scores a touchdown by entering its opponent's end zone while carrying the ball or catching the ball while being within the end zone. If the ball is carried by a player, it is considered a score when any part of the ball is directly above or beyond any part of the goal line between the pylons.[1] In addition, a two-point conversion may be scored after a touchdown by the same means.  In Ultimate Frisbee, a goal is scored by completing a pass into the end zone.[2]  The end zone in American football is 10 yards long by 53+1\u20443 yards (160 feet) wide. A full-sized end zone in Canadian football is 20 yards long by 65 yards wide. Prior to the 1980s, the Canadian end zone was 25 yards long. The first stadium to use the 20-yard-long end zone was B.C. Place in Vancouver, which was completed in 1983. The floor of B.C. Place was (and is) too short to accommodate a field 160 yards in length. The shorter end zone proved popular enough that the CFL adopted it league-wide in 1986.[3] At BMO Field, home to the Toronto Argonauts, the end zones are only 18 yards.[4] Like their American counterparts, Canadian endzones are marked with four pylons.  In Canadian football stadiums that also feature a running track, it is usually necessary to truncate the back corners of the end zones, since a rectangular field 150 yards long and 65 yards wide will not fit completely inside an oval-shaped running track. Such truncations are marked as straight diagonal lines, resulting in an end zone with six corners and six pylons. As of 2019, Montreal's Percival Molson Stadium is the only CFL stadium that has the rounded-off end zones.  During the CFL's failed American expansion in the mid-1990s, several stadiums, by necessity, used 15-yard end zones (some had end zones that were even shorter than 15 yards); only Baltimore and San Antonio had the endzones at the standard 20 yards.  Ultimate Frisbee uses an end zone 40 yards wide and 20 yards deep (37\u00a0m \u00d7 18\u00a0m).[5]  The location and dimensions of a goal post differ from league to league, but it is usually within the boundaries of the end zone.  In earlier football games (both professional and collegiate), the goal post began at the goal line, and was usually an H-shaped bar.  Nowadays, for player safety reasons, almost all goal posts in the professional and collegiate levels of American football are T-shaped (resembling a slingshot), and reside just outside the rear of both end zones; these goalposts were first seen in 1966 and were invented by Jim Trimble and Joel Rottman in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.[6]  The goal posts in Canadian football still reside on the goal line instead of the back of the end zones, partly because the number of field goal attempts would dramatically decrease if the posts were moved 20 yards back in that sport, and also because the larger end zone and wider field makes the resulting interference in play by the goal post a less serious problem.[citation needed]  At the high school level, it is not uncommon to see multi-purpose goal posts that include football goal posts at the top and a soccer net at the bottom; these are usually seen at smaller schools and in multi-purpose stadiums where facilities are used for multiple sports. When these or H-shaped goal posts are used in football, the lower portions of the posts are covered with several inches of heavy foam padding to protect the safety of the players.[7]  Most professional and collegiate teams have their logo, team name, or both painted on the surface of the end zone, with team colors filling the background. Many championship and bowl games at college and professional level are commemorated by the names of the opposing teams each being painted in one of the opposite end zones. In some leagues, along with bowl games, local, national, or bowl game sponsors may also have their logos placed in the end zone. In the CFL, fully painted end zones are nonexistent, though some feature club logos or sponsors. Additionally, the Canadian end zone, being a live-ball part of the field, often features yardage dashes (usually marked every five yards), not unlike the field of play itself.  In many places, particularly in smaller high schools and colleges, end zones are undecorated, or have plain white diagonal stripes spaced several yards apart, in lieu of colors and decorations. One notable use of this design in major college football is the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, who have both end zones at Notre Dame Stadium painted with diagonal white lines. In professional football, since 2004, the Pittsburgh Steelers of the NFL have the south end zone at Acrisure Stadium (formerly Heinz Field) painted with diagonal-lines during most of the regular season, with the north end zone featuring only the city name of Pittsburgh in yellow. This is done because Acrisure Stadium, which has a natural grass playing surface, is also home to the Pittsburgh Panthers of college football and the markings simplify field conversion between the two teams' respective field markings and logos, with both teams sharing a secondary yellow color, but each having different primary colors. After the Panthers' season is over, the Steelers logo is painted in the south end zone.[8]  Likewise, some end zones are painted in tribute to a recently deceased team figure or fan, as is done with the Steelers' AFC North rival Baltimore Ravens at M&T Bank Stadium, where the city name is painted as usual in the end zone, except for the \"MO\" portion, which is painted in gold or white in tribute to the late Mo Gaba, a young fan of both the Ravens and Orioles.[9]  One of the major quirks of the American Football League was its use of unusual patterns such as argyle in its end zones, a tradition revived in 2009 by the Denver Broncos to celebrate the team's 50th anniversary, Denver itself a former AFL team. The original XFL standardized its playing fields so that all eight of its teams had uniform fields with the XFL logo in each end zone and no team identification. "},{"title":"Ball in and out of play","content":"The ball in and out of play is the ninth law of the Laws of the Game of association football, and describes to the two basic states of play in the game.  The ball remains in play from the beginning of each period to the end of that period, except when:  The first criterion can be phrased as \"all of the ball must cross all of the line\" and is of particular importance in decisions regarding goals. The question of whether the ball has crossed the line has often caused controversy in high-profile matches, such as in the example of Geoff Hurst's goal in the 1966 World Cup Final, that put England 3-2 up over West Germany in extra time. [2] The Law specifically notes that the ball remains in play if it rebounds off a goal frame or corner flag onto the field, or in any case of the ball touching a match official that is not mentioned above.   When the ball is in play players may play the ball, contest the ball, and goals may be scored. Players are liable to punishment for committing fouls. Substitutions may not occur whilst the ball is in play.  In the case a foul is committed or misconduct occurs, the referee may \"play advantage\" and elect to allow play to continue if the team of the player who was victimized would be benefited if play were to continue. Once play has stopped, the referee may choose to issue punishments.  When the ball becomes out of play, the ball is put back into play by the appropriate restart. The restarts in football are:  Once the ball is out of play, the only restart is the restart appropriate for the reason the ball went out of play in the first place; subsequent actions do not change the restart. For example, if the ball goes out of play because of a foul by Team A against Team B, the restart must be a free kick to Team B even if a Team B player strikes an opponent; offending Team B player would, however, be liable for misconduct (i.e. yellow card or red card).  Note, however, that the referee may change the original restart if he realises he has made an error or on the advice of his assistant referees, provided play has not yet restarted. For example, if the ball has gone out of play because the ball was kicked into goal by Team A and the referee has signalled that a goal has been scored, but then notices that an assistant referee has indicated a foul by a Team A player immediately before the goal was scored, the referee would change to the correct restart of a free kick to Team B where the foul occurred. "},{"title":"Goal (sports)","content":"  In sport, a goal may refer to either an instance of scoring, or to the physical structure or area where an attacking team must send the ball or puck in order to score points. The structure of a goal varies from sport to sport, and one is placed at or near each end of the playing field for each team to defend. For many sports, each goal structure usually consists of two vertical posts, called goal posts, supporting a horizontal crossbar. A goal line marked on the playing surface between the goal posts demarcates the goal area. Thus, the objective is to send the ball or puck between the goal posts, under or over the crossbar (depending on the sport), and across the goal line. Other sports may have other types of structures or areas where the ball or puck must pass through, such as the basketball hoop. Sports which feature goal scoring are also commonly known as invasion games.[1][2]  In several sports, sending the ball or puck into the opponent's goal structure or area is the sole method of scoring, and thus the final score is expressed in the total number of goals scored by each team. In other sports, a goal may be one of several scoring methods, and thus may be worth a different set number of points than the others.  In some sports, the goal is the sole method of scoring. In these sports, the final score is expressed as the number of goals scored by each team, with the winner being the team that accumulated more over the specified time period.  In other sports, a goal is not the sole method of scoring. In these sports, the goal is worth a set number of points but there are other methods of scoring which may be worth more, the same, or fewer points. In these sports, the score is expressed as the total number of points earned by each team.  In Australian rules football the score is expressed by listing the quantity of each team's \"goals\" and \"behinds\" followed by the total number of points.  The structure of a goal varies from sport to sport. Most often, it is a rectangular structure that is placed at each end of the playing field. Each structure usually consists of two vertical posts, called goal posts (side bar or uprights) supporting a horizontal crossbar. A goal line marked on the playing surface between the goal posts demarcates the goal area.  In some games, such as association football or hockey, the object is to pass the ball between the posts below the crossbar, while in others, such as those based on rugby, the ball must pass over the crossbar instead. In Gaelic football and hurling, in which the goalposts are similar to those used in rugby, the ball can be kicked either under the crossbar for a goal, or over the crossbar between the posts for a point. In Australian rules football, there is no crossbar but four uprights instead. In basketball, netball or korfball, goals are ring-shaped. The structure is often accompanied with an auxiliary net, which stops or slows down the ball when a goal is scored. In netball, a single post at each end of the court supports a horizontal hoop that the ball must fall through. In basketball, the hoop and net used for scoring can be supported on a post or mechanism at each end, or on structures attached directly to the wall.  The goal is the only method of scoring in several games. In each of these cases, the winner is the team that scores the most goals within the specified time.  In association football, the goal is the only method of scoring. It is also used to refer to the scoring structure. An attempt on goal is referred to as a \"shot\". To score a goal, the ball must pass completely over the goal line between the goal posts and under the crossbar and no rules may be violated on the play (such as touching the ball with the hand or arm).[3] See also offside.  The goal structure is defined as a frame 24\u00a0feet (7.32\u00a0m) wide by 8\u00a0feet (2.44\u00a0m) tall. In most organized levels of play a net is attached behind the goal frame to catch the ball and indicate that a goal has been scored; but the Laws of the Game do not mandate the use of a net and only require that any net used not interfere with the goalkeeper.[4]  In bandy, which has much of its structure from association football, the only way of scoring is to make a goal and the goal is also used to refer to the scoring structure. If neither of the teams has scored during a match, or if both teams have made the same number of goals, there is a draw. If not otherwise decided in the Bandy Playing Rules set up by the Federation of International Bandy,[5] an approved goal is made when the ball is played in a regular manner and the whole ball has passed the inner definition of the goal line between the two goal posts and the cross-bar. This is stated in section 9 of the Rules. A goal can be made directly from a stroke-off, penalty-shot, a free-stroke, a face-off or a corner stroke. Centered at each short-line of the bandy field is a 3.5\u00a0m (11\u00a0ft) wide and 2.1\u00a0m (6\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in) high goal cage, regulated to size, form, material and other properties in section 1.4 of the Bandy Playing Rules. The cage has a net to stop the ball when it has crossed the goal-line. The cage shall be of an approved model. In front of the goal cage is a half-circular penalty area with a 17\u00a0m (56\u00a0ft) radius. A penalty spot is located 12 metres (39\u00a0ft) in front of the goal and there are two free-stroke spots at the penalty area line, each surrounded by a 5\u00a0m (16\u00a0ft) circle.  The goal structure in field hockey is 3.66 metres (12.0\u00a0ft) wide by 2.14 metres (7.0\u00a0ft) tall. Like association football, a goal is scored when the ball passes completely over the goal line under the crossbar and between the goal posts. Nets are required to hold the ball in.[6] A goal is only scored if shot from with a semicircle 14.63 metres (48.0\u00a0ft) from the goal.[6]  A goal in handball is scored when the ball is thrown completely over the goal line, below the crossbar and between the goal posts.[7] The goal structure in team handball is 2\u00a0metres high and 3\u00a0metres wide. A net is required to catch the ball.[7]  In ice hockey, the puck must be put completely over the goal line between the posts and under the bar either off an offensive player's stick or off any part of a defensive player's body. The puck may not be kicked, batted, or thrown into the goal, though a goal may be awarded if the puck is inadvertently deflected off an offensive player's skate or body into the goal.[citation needed] The goal structure is a frame 4 feet (1.2\u00a0m) tall and 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m) wide with a net attached. In most higher levels of play the goal structure is attached to the ice surface by flexible pegs and will break away for safety when hit by a player. The goal is placed within the playing surface, and players may play the puck behind the goal.[8]  Lacrosse goals are scored when the ball travels completely past the goal line. Goals can be disallowed if there is an infraction by the offensive team. The goal in lacrosse is 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m) tall and 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m) wide and a net is used to prevent the ball from reentering the field of play. Lacrosse goals are not positioned on the end boundary line; play often occurs behind the goal.[9]  In netball, a goal is scored when the ball is shot through a goal ring on a pole.  In polo, a goal is scored if the ball passes completely between the goal posts, regardless of how far off the ground the ball is.  The ball must be between the goal posts or the imaginary lines extending above the inside edges of the posts.  A ball passing directly over a goal post does not score a goal.[10]  The goal structure in Polo consists of two poles, at least 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) high and exactly 8 yards apart.  There is no crossbar and no net is required. The height at which a goal may be scored is infinite.[10]  In Hardcourt Bike Polo, a goal is scored if the ball passes completely over the goal line and the shot originated as a \"shot\" as defined by the rules. A shot is made with either end of the mallet head similar to swinging a hammer whereas a shuffle is made with the long side like pushing a broom. Traditionally when using a non-netted goal such as two traffic cones the play is continued if the ball is shuffled through the goal of pass through the goal from the opposite direction. These non-netted goals are no long regulation[11][12] in competitive play but are common depending on the resources of a club.  In shinty, a goal is scored if the ball goes over the goal line and under the crossbar. A goal can only be scored with a stick called a \"caman\"; no goal is scored if the ball is kicked, carried, or propelled by an attacking player's hand or arm.  A goal in water polo is scored when the ball passes completely across the goal line, under the crossbar and between the goal posts.  A goal may be scored through contact with any part of the attacker's body except a clenched fist.[13] The goal structure in water polo is dependent upon the depth of the water.  The goal mouth measures 3\u00a0metres across and is either 0.9\u00a0metres above the surface of the water or 2.4\u00a0metres above the floor of the pool, whichever is higher.  Nets are required.[13]  The following games have more than one possible method of scoring where the goal is the primary method, i.e. the method that scores the most points. In most cases the score is shown as the number of goals, plus the number of secondary scores (usually 1 point), plus the total number of points. The side with the higher number of total points is the winner.  In Australian rules football a goal is scored when the ball is kicked by an attacking player completely between the two tall goal posts. To be awarded a goal, the ball may not contact or pass over the goal post, or touch any player on any part of the body other than the foot or lower leg of an attacker. In such cases, the score is a behind (1 point). The ball may be punted, drop kicked, or kicked off the ground (soccered). The ball may cross the goal line at any height from ground level up and may bounce before crossing the line. A goal scores six points. The behind, which scores one point; is awarded if the ball passes between the point posts or is not awarded a goal by the above provisions when passing through the goal posts.[14] The goal structure consists of two posts at least 6\u00a0metres in height and spaced 6.4\u00a0metres apart. There is no crossbar and no net.[14]  The primary object of basketball is to score by shooting (i.e., throwing) the ball into a goal officially called the basket. A basket is scored when the ball passes completely through the basket ring from above; however, the number of points scored with each basket depends on where on the court the ball was shot from, and a team does not necessarily need to score the most baskets to win the game. Basketball scores are expressed in total points.[15]  A basket scored during normal play is called a field goal and is worth two points if shot from within or on the three-point line, and three points if shot from beyond the three-point line. The three-point line's distance from the basket varies by level. Points are also awarded to the shooting team if the defensive team commits goaltending or basket interference while the ball is in flight towards the basket or is directly over it.  A basketball team can also score by free throws, which score one point each. Free throws are awarded to a team after the opponent commits a foul in certain scenarios. The player taking the free throws (usually the player who was fouled) is entitled to take a specified number of shots unopposed with both feet behind the free throw line.  The basket consists of a metal ring 18 inches (46\u00a0cm) in internal diameter, suspended horizontally 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) above the floor such that the center of the ring is equidistant from each sideline and 5\u00a0feet 3\u00a0inches (1.60\u00a0m) from the end line. The basket ring has a net attached below to briefly check the ball's downward progress and indicate a score. The ring is fastened to a rectangular backboard 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m) wide by 3.5 feet (1.1\u00a0m) tall,[16][17] though in lower levels of play or recreational use the backboard may be smaller and\/or fan-shaped. The entire structure is supported from behind and anchored to the floor beyond the end line at higher levels of play; the structure may be anchored to a wall or ceiling at lower levels of play.[17] The ring, net, and the front, top, bottom, and sides of the backboard are all considered inbounds, while the back of the backboard and the support structure \u2013 even those parts suspended over inbounds areas of the court \u2013 are considered out of bounds.[citation needed]  In Gaelic football a goal is scored when the ball passes completely beyond the goal line, between the goal posts and under the cross bar. The ball can be played with the hands, but a goal cannot be scored by hand. A ball travelling between the goal posts and over the cross bar is awarded one pointed called an \"over\". Overs are the most common scoring method with goals heavily defended.[18] A goal is worth three points.  In hurling the ball must pass completely beyond the goal line.  The ball may be played by any legal method except by the hand of the attacker.  A ball in flight may be deflected into the goal off the hand of an attacker. Hurling and Gaelic football use the same goal structure.  It is a 6.4\u00a0meter wide frame with a net attached.  The goal posts are at least 6\u00a0meters high, and the crossbar is 2.44\u00a0meters above the ground.  A goal is scored when the ball crosses below the crossbar and a point is scored when the ball passes above it.[18]  At each end of the field in the following games, there is both a marked scoring area and a separate goal post structure. In these games, the term \"goal\" is only used for the secondary scoring method of putting the ball through the goal post structure.  In American and Canadian football, there is a scoring area marked at each end of the field called an end zone, and a separate goal post structure.  The primary method of scoring is a touchdown. Whether running, passing, returning a kickoff or punt, or recovering a turnover, a team scores a touchdown by advancing the ball into the end zone. A touchdown scores 6 points in both versions of the sport. The front line of the end zone is the \"goal line\", its back line is the \"end line\", and each corner is marked with a pylon. Each end zone in American football is about 10 by 53.33 yards (9.14\u00a0m \u00d7\u00a048.76\u00a0m) wide, while each end zone in Canadian football is about 20 by 65 yards (18\u00a0m \u00d7\u00a059\u00a0m) wide. Unlike other sports which require the ball\/puck to pass completely over the goal line to count as a score, both Canadian and American football merely need any part of the ball to break the vertical plane of the outer edge of the goal line to count as a touchdown.  A field goal is a secondary method of scoring; it is scored when the ball is place kicked or drop kicked completely over the crossbar and between or directly over the goal posts. A field goal scores 3 points in both versions of the sport. In the American game, the now rarely used fair catch kick, if successfully made, also scores 3 points. A goal kicked during a try following a touchdown is worth one point.[19][20] These are the only methods of putting the ball through the goal posts that award points to the kicking team; no points are scored if the ball is punted or thrown through the goal posts, or if the ball goes through the goal posts on a kickoff (except, in the latter case, in indoor American football, where some leagues award a single point).  In both sports, the goal structure consists of a horizontal crossbar suspended ten feet (3.05\u00a0m) above the ground and vertical goal posts (\"uprights\") placed 18\u00a0feet 6\u00a0inches (5.64\u00a0m) apart and extending at least 35 feet (10.67\u00a0m) above the crossbar. In lower levels of play the goal posts may be placed further apart and\/or not extend as far above the crossbar; for example, in high school football the posts are 23\u00a0feet 4\u00a0inches (7.11\u00a0m) apart. NFL and CFL rules mandate that a ribbon be attached to the top of each goal post.[21][22] Goals are centered on the field, but on different lines: in American football, they lie on the \"end line\" (far end of the end zone) and in Canadian football, on the \"goal line\" (beginning of the end zone). A retractable net may be placed behind the goal posts, well beyond the field of play, to prevent the ball from entering spectator areas.  Until the mid-1960s, the goal posts were similar in design to rugby posts, with the crossbar and uprights supported by stanchions installed directly underneath the uprights (in the shape of the letter 'H'). A transitional design from this time retained the twin set of stanchions but placed them behind the crossbar. In this design, the crossbar and uprights were supported by a set of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal stanchions behind each upright. This design was last used professionally in the first Super Bowl in January 1967. The modern goal posts supported by a single \"goose-necked\" stanchion (in the shape of the letter 'Y') made their debut in the 1966 CFL playoffs and were adopted by all three professional leagues (CFL, NFL, and AFL) the following year, with many (but not all) college teams following suit in the years since.[23] The NFL, which merged with the AFL in 1970, had its crossbar over the goal line until\u00a01974.  In arena football, a field goal also scores three points, unless it is drop kicked, in which case it scores four points.[24] The goal structure in arena football is much smaller than the outdoor game; it consists of a crossbar 15 feet (4.57\u00a0m) above the playing surface and 9.5 feet (2.90\u00a0m) wide; this size is also used for most other indoor leagues as well.  Uniquely in arena football, the goal posts are attached to nets on either side of the crossbar which are taut to allow the ball to rebound back onto the field of play. The nets are 30 feet (9.14\u00a0m) wide and 37 feet (11.28\u00a0m) high. These nets do not represent a scoring area, but keep the ball in play and prevent it from entering the crowd.[24]  Canadian football also offers a secondary form of goal, the rouge or single point; it is awarded if a ball enters the end zone by way of any kick (either a missed field goal or a punt) and is not returned by the opposing team; this is not offered in American football (such a play results in a touchback instead).    In both rugby codes, there is a scoring area marked at each end of the field called an in-goal area, and a separate H-shaped goal structure. The primary scoring method is a try, worth 5 points in rugby union and worth 4 points in rugby league. A try is scored by grounding the ball in the in-goal area.  A goal is scored in either rugby code by place kicking or drop kicking a ball over the crossbar and between the uprights of H-shaped goalposts.[25][26] The goalposts are positioned centrally on the goal line (the front line of the in-goal area). The crossbar is 3 metres (9.8\u00a0ft) from the ground; the uprights are 5.5 metres (18\u00a0ft) apart in rugby league and 5.6 metres (18\u00a0ft) in rugby union.  In the early years of rugby, only goals counted in scoring, and a \"try\" counted only if \"converted\" into a goal. The official name \"goal from a try\" for a converted try persisted until 1979.  Celebrating the scoring of a goal is common. It is normally performed by the goalscorer, and may involve his or her teammates, the manager or coaching staff and\/or the supporters of the team. Whilst referring to the celebration of a goal in general, the term can also be applied to specific actions, such as a player removing his shirt or performing a somersault.  The expression \"moving the goalposts\", which means to make a set of goals more difficult just as they are being met, is often used in business but is derived from association football.[28] It is commonly used to imply bad faith on the part of those setting goals for others to meet, by arbitrarily making additional demands just as the initial ones are about to be met.  In business, the concept is more abstract, with some performance measure or target being set as a goalpost while achieving the target is often known as achieving a goal. "},{"title":"Welsh language","content":"  Welsh (Cymraeg [k\u0259m\u02c8ra\u02d0i\u0261] \u24d8 or y Gymraeg [\u0259 \u0261\u0259m\u02c8ra\u02d0i\u0261]) is a Celtic language of the Brittonic subgroup that is native to the Welsh people. Welsh is spoken natively in Wales, by some in England, and in Y Wladfa (the Welsh colony in Chubut Province, Argentina).[7]  It is spoken by smaller numbers of people in Canada and the United States descended from Welsh immigrants, within their households (especially in Nova Scotia). Historically, it has also been known in English as \"British\",[8] \"Cambrian\",[9] \"Cambric\"[10] and \"Cymric\".[11]  The Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011 gave the Welsh language official status in Wales.[12] Welsh and English are de jure official languages of the Welsh Parliament, the Senedd,[13] with Welsh being the only de jure official language in any part of the United Kingdom, with English being de facto official.  According to the 2021 census, the Welsh-speaking population of Wales aged three or older was 538,300 (17.8%) and nearly three quarters of the population in Wales said they had no Welsh language skills.[14] Other estimates suggest that 896,300 people (29.2%) aged three or older in Wales could speak Welsh in December 2023.[15] Almost half of all Welsh speakers consider themselves fluent, while 20 per cent are able to speak a fair amount.[16] 56 per cent of Welsh speakers speak the language daily, and 19 per cent speak the language weekly.[16]  The Welsh government plans to increase the number of Welsh-language speakers to one million by 2050. Since 1980, the number of children attending Welsh-medium schools has increased, while the number going to Welsh bilingual and dual-medium schools has decreased.[17] Welsh is considered the least endangered Celtic language by UNESCO.[18]  The language of the Welsh developed from the language of Britons.[19] The emergence of Welsh was not instantaneous and clearly identifiable. Instead, the shift occurred over a long period, with some historians claiming that it had happened by as late as the 9th century, with a watershed moment being that proposed by linguist Kenneth H. Jackson, the Battle of Dyrham, a military battle between the West Saxons and the Britons in 577 AD,[20] which split the South Western British from direct overland contact with the Welsh.  Four periods are identified in the history of Welsh, with rather indistinct boundaries: Primitive Welsh, Old Welsh, Middle Welsh, and Modern Welsh. The period immediately following the language's emergence is sometimes referred to as Primitive Welsh,[20] followed by the Old Welsh period \u2013 which is generally considered to stretch from the beginning of the 9th century to sometime during the 12th century.[20] The Middle Welsh period is considered to have lasted from then until the 14th century, when the Modern Welsh period began, which in turn is divided into Early and Late Modern Welsh.  The word Welsh is a descendant, via Old English wealh, wielisc, of the Proto-Germanic word *Walhaz, which was derived from the name of the Celtic people known to the Romans as Volcae and which came to refer to speakers of Celtic languages, and then indiscriminately to the people of the Western Roman Empire. In Old English the term went through semantic narrowing, coming to refer to either Britons in particular or, in some contexts, slaves.[21] The plural form W\u0113alas evolved into the name for their territory, Wales.[22]  The modern names for various Romance-speaking people in Continental Europe (e.g. Walloons, Valaisans, Vlachs\/Wallachians, and W\u0142osi, the Polish name for Italians) have a similar etymology.[23] The Welsh term for the language, Cymraeg, descends from the Brythonic word combrogi, meaning 'compatriots' or 'fellow countrymen'.[24]  Welsh evolved from Common Brittonic, the Celtic language spoken by the ancient Celtic Britons. Classified as Insular Celtic, the British language probably arrived in Britain during the Bronze Age or Iron Age and was probably spoken throughout the island south of the Firth of Forth.[25] During the Early Middle Ages the British language began to fragment due to increased dialect differentiation, thus evolving into Welsh and the other Brittonic languages. It is not clear when Welsh became distinct.[20][26][27]  Linguist Kenneth H. Jackson has suggested that the evolution in syllabic structure and sound pattern was complete by around AD 550, and labelled the period between then and about AD 800 \"Primitive Welsh\".[28] This Primitive Welsh may have been spoken in both Wales and the Hen Ogledd ('Old North') \u2013 the Brittonic-speaking areas of what are now northern England and southern Scotland \u2013 and therefore may have been the ancestor of Cumbric as well as Welsh. Jackson, however, believed that the two varieties were already distinct by that time.[20]  The earliest Welsh poetry \u2013 that attributed to the Cynfeirdd or \"Early Poets\" \u2013 is generally considered to date to the Primitive Welsh period. However, much of this poetry was supposedly composed in the Hen Ogledd, raising further questions about the dating of the material and language in which it was originally composed.[20] This discretion stems from the fact that Cumbric was widely believed to have been the language used in Hen Ogledd. An 8th-century inscription in Tywyn shows the language already dropping inflections in the declension of nouns.[29]  Janet Davies proposed that the origins of the Welsh language were much less definite; in The Welsh Language: A History, she proposes that Welsh may have been around even earlier than 600 AD. This is evidenced by the dropping of final syllables from Brittonic: *bardos 'poet' became bardd, and *abona 'river' became afon.[26] Though both Davies and Jackson cite minor changes in syllable structure and sounds as evidence for the creation of Old Welsh, Davies suggests it may be more appropriate to refer to this derivative language as Lingua Britannica rather than characterising it as a new language altogether.  The argued dates for the period of \"Primitive Welsh\" are widely debated, with some historians' suggestions differing by hundreds of years.  The next main period is Old Welsh (Hen Gymraeg, 9th to 11th centuries); poetry from both Wales and Scotland has been preserved in this form of the language. As Germanic and Gaelic colonisation of Britain proceeded, the Brittonic speakers in Wales were split off from those in northern England, speaking Cumbric, and those in the southwest, speaking what would become Cornish, so the languages diverged. Both the works of Aneirin (Canu Aneirin, c.\u2009600) and the Book of Taliesin (Canu Taliesin) were written during this era.  Middle Welsh (Cymraeg Canol) is the label attached to the Welsh of the 12th to 14th centuries, of which much more remains than for any earlier period. This is the language of nearly all surviving early manuscripts of the Mabinogion, although the tales themselves are certainly much older. It is also the language of the existing Welsh law manuscripts. Middle Welsh is reasonably intelligible to a modern-day Welsh speaker.  The Bible translations into Welsh helped maintain the use of Welsh in daily life, and standardised spelling. The New Testament was translated by William Salesbury in 1567,[31] and the complete Bible by William Morgan in 1588.[32] Modern Welsh is subdivided into Early Modern Welsh and Late Modern Welsh.[33] Early Modern Welsh ran from the 15th century through to the end of the 16th century,[34] and the Late Modern Welsh period roughly dates from the 16th century onwards. Contemporary Welsh differs greatly from the Welsh of the 16th century, but they are similar enough for a fluent Welsh speaker to have little trouble understanding it.  During the Modern Welsh period, there has been a decline in the popularity of the Welsh language: the number of Welsh speakers declined to the point at which there was concern that the language would become extinct. During industrialisation in the late 19th century, immigrants from England led to the decline in Welsh speakers particularly in the South Wales Valleys.[35] Welsh government processes and legislation have worked to increase the proliferation of the Welsh language, for example through education.[36]  Welsh has been spoken continuously in Wales throughout history; however, by 1911, it had become a minority language, spoken by 43.5 per cent of the population.[37] While this decline continued over the following decades, the language did not die out. The smallest number of speakers was recorded in 1981 with 503,000 although the lowest percentage was recorded in the most recent census in 2021 at 17.8 per cent.[38] By the start of the 21st century, numbers began to increase once more, at least partly as a result of the increase in Welsh-medium education.[39][40]  The 2004 Welsh Language Use Survey showed that 21.7 per cent of the population of Wales spoke Welsh,[41] compared with 20.8 per cent in the 2001 census, and 18.5 per cent in the 1991 census. Since 2001, however, the number of Welsh speakers has declined in both the 2011 and 2021 censuses to about  538,300 or 17.8 per cent in 2021 lower than 1991, although it is still higher in absolute terms.[42][43] The 2011 census also showed a \"big drop\" in the number of speakers in the Welsh-speaking heartlands, with the number dropping to under 50 per cent in Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire for the first time.[44] However, according to the Welsh Language Use Survey in 2019\u201320, 22 per cent of people aged three and over were able to speak Welsh.[45]  The Annual Population Survey (APS) by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated that as of December 2023, approximately 896,300, or 29.2 per cent of the population of Wales aged 3 and over, were able to speak the language.[46] Children and young people aged three to 15 years old were more likely to report that they could speak Welsh than any other age group (49.9 per cent, 245,400). Around 1,020,800 people, or 33.3 per cent, reported that they could understand spoken Welsh. The APS estimates of Welsh language ability are historically higher than those produced by the census.[47]  In terms of usage, ONS also reported that 14.9 per cent (458,500) of people aged three or older in Wales reported that they spoke Welsh daily in December 2023, with 5.6 per cent (172,100) speaking it weekly and 7.0 per cent (215,000) less often. Approximately 1.6 per cent (50,100) reported that they never spoke Welsh despite being able to speak the language, with the remaining 70.8 per cent of the population not being able to speak it.[48]  The National Survey for Wales, conducted by Welsh Government, has also tended to have a higher percentage of Welsh speakers than the census, with the most recent results for 2022\u20132023 suggesting that 18 per cent of the population aged 3 and over were able to speak Welsh, with an additional 16 per cent noting that they had some Welsh-speaking ability.[49]  Historically, large numbers of Welsh people spoke only Welsh.[50] Over the course of the 20th century this monolingual population all but disappeared, but a small percentage remained at the time of the 1981 census.[51] Most Welsh-speaking people in Wales also speak English. However, many[quantify] Welsh-speaking people are more comfortable expressing themselves in Welsh than in English. A speaker's choice of language can vary according to the subject domain and the social context, even within a single discourse (known in linguistics as code-switching).[52]  Welsh speakers are largely concentrated in the north and west of Wales, principally Gwynedd, Conwy County Borough, Denbighshire, Anglesey, Carmarthenshire, north Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, parts of Glamorgan, and north-west and extreme south-west Powys. However, first-language and other fluent speakers can be found throughout Wales.[53]  Welsh-speaking communities persisted well into the modern period across the border in England. Archenfield was still Welsh enough in the time of Elizabeth I for the Bishop of Hereford to be made responsible, together with the four Welsh bishops, for the translation of the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer into Welsh. Welsh was still commonly spoken there in the first half of the 19th century, and churchwardens' notices were put up in both Welsh and English until about 1860.[54] Alexander John Ellis in the 1880s identified a small part of Shropshire as still then speaking Welsh, with the \"Celtic Border\" passing from Llanymynech through Oswestry to Chirk.[55]  The number of Welsh-speaking people in the rest of Britain has not yet been counted for statistical purposes. In 1993, the Welsh-language television channel S4C published the results of a survey into the numbers of people who spoke or understood Welsh, which estimated that there were around 133,000 Welsh-speaking people living in England, about 50,000 of them in the Greater London area.[56] The Welsh Language Board, on the basis of an analysis of the Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study, estimated there were 110,000 Welsh-speaking people in England, and another thousand in Scotland and Northern Ireland.[57]  In the 2011 census, 8,248 people in England gave Welsh in answer to the question \"What is your main language?\"[58] The Office for National Statistics subsequently published a census glossary of terms to support the release of results from the census, including their definition of \"main language\" as referring to \"first or preferred language\" (though that wording was not in the census questionnaire itself).[59][60] The wards in England with the most people giving Welsh as their main language were the Liverpool wards of Central and Greenbank; and Oswestry South in Shropshire.[58] The wards of Oswestry South (1.15%), Oswestry East (0.86%) and St Oswald (0.71%) had the highest percentage of residents giving Welsh as their main language.  The census also revealed that 3,528 wards in England, or 46% of the total number, contained at least one resident whose main language is Welsh. In terms of the regions of England, North West England (1,945), London (1,310) and the West Midlands (1,265) had the highest number of people noting Welsh as their main language.[61] According to the 2021 census, 7,349 people in England recorded Welsh to be their \"main language\".[62]  In the 2011 census, 1,189 people aged three and over in Scotland noted that Welsh was a language (other than English) that they used at home.[63]  It is believed that there are as many as 5,000 speakers of Patagonian Welsh.[64]  In response to the question 'Does the person speak a language other than English at home?' in the 2016 Australian census, 1,688 people noted that they spoke Welsh.[65]  In the 2011 Canadian census, 3,885 people reported Welsh as their first language.[66] According to the 2021 Canadian census, 1,130 people noted that Welsh was their mother tongue.[67][68]  The 2018 New Zealand census noted that 1,083 people in New Zealand spoke Welsh.[69]  The American Community Survey 2009\u20132013 noted that 2,235 people aged five years and over in the United States spoke Welsh at home. The highest number of those (255) lived in Florida.[70]    Calls for the Welsh language to be granted official status grew with the establishment of the nationalist political party Plaid Cymru in 1925, the establishment of the Welsh Language Society in 1962 and the rise of Welsh nationalism in the later 20th century. Of the six living Celtic languages (including two revived), Welsh has the highest number of native speakers who use the language on a daily basis, and it is the only Celtic language which is not considered to be endangered by UNESCO.  The Welsh Language Act 1993 and the Government of Wales Act 1998 provide that the Welsh and English languages be treated equally in the public sector, as far as is reasonable and practicable. Each public body is required to prepare for approval a Welsh Language Scheme, which indicates its commitment to the equality of treatment principle. This is sent out in draft form for public consultation for a three-month period, whereupon comments on it may be incorporated into a final version. It requires the final approval of the now defunct Welsh Language Board (Bwrdd yr Iaith Gymraeg). Thereafter, the public body is charged with implementing and fulfilling its obligations under the Welsh Language Scheme. The list of other public bodies which have to prepare Schemes could be added to by initially the Secretary of State for Wales, from 1993 to 1997, by way of statutory instrument. Subsequent to the forming of the National Assembly for Wales in 1997, the Government Minister responsible for the Welsh language can and has passed statutory instruments naming public bodies who have to prepare Schemes. Neither the 1993 Act nor secondary legislation made under it covers the private sector, although some organisations, notably banks and some railway companies, provide some of their information in Welsh.[71][72]  On 7 December 2010, the Welsh Assembly unanimously approved a set of measures to develop the use of the Welsh language within Wales.[73][74] On 9 February 2011 this measure, the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011, was passed and received Royal Assent, thus making the Welsh language an officially recognised language within Wales. The measure:  The measure requires public bodies and some private companies to provide services in Welsh. The Welsh government's Minister for Heritage at the time, Alun Ffred Jones, said, \"The Welsh language is a source of great pride for the people of Wales, whether they speak it or not, and I am delighted that this measure has now become law. I am very proud to have steered legislation through the Assembly which confirms the official status of the Welsh language; which creates a strong advocate for Welsh speakers and will improve the quality and quantity of services available through the medium of Welsh. I believe that everyone who wants to access services in the Welsh language should be able to do so, and that is what this government has worked towards. This legislation is an important and historic step forward for the language, its speakers and for the nation.\"[75] The measure was not welcomed warmly by all supporters: Bethan Williams, chairman of the Welsh Language Society, gave a mixed response to the move, saying, \"Through this measure we have won official status for the language and that has been warmly welcomed. But there was a core principle missing in the law passed by the Assembly before Christmas. It doesn't give language rights to the people of Wales in every aspect of their lives. Despite that, an amendment to that effect was supported by 18 Assembly Members from three different parties, and that was a significant step forward.\"[76]  On 5 October 2011, Meri Huws, Chair of the Welsh Language Board, was appointed the new Welsh Language Commissioner.[77] She released a statement that she was \"delighted\" to have been appointed to the \"hugely important role\", adding, \"I look forward to working with the Welsh Government and organisations in Wales in developing the new system of standards. I will look to build on the good work that has been done by the Welsh Language Board and others to strengthen the Welsh language and ensure that it continues to thrive.\" First Minister Carwyn Jones said that Huws would act as a champion for the Welsh language, though some had concerns over her appointment: Plaid Cymru spokeswoman Bethan Jenkins said, \"I have concerns about the transition from Meri Huws's role from the Welsh Language Board to the language commissioner, and I will be asking the Welsh government how this will be successfully managed. We must be sure that there is no conflict of interest, and that the Welsh Language Commissioner can demonstrate how she will offer the required fresh approach to this new role.\" Huws started her role as the Welsh Language Commissioner on 1 April 2012.  Local councils and the Senedd use Welsh, issuing Welsh versions of their literature, to varying degrees.  Road signs in Wales are in Welsh and English.[78] Prior to 2016, the choice of which language to display first was the responsibility of the local council. Since then, as part of the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011, all new signs have Welsh displayed first.[79] There have been incidents of one of the languages being vandalised, which may be considered a hate crime.[80][81]  Since 2000, the teaching of Welsh has been compulsory in all schools in Wales up to age 16; this has had an effect in stabilising and reversing the decline in the language.[82]  Text on UK coins tends to be in English and Latin.  However, a Welsh-language edge inscription was used on pound coins dated 1985, 1990 and 1995, which circulated in all parts of the UK prior to their 2017 withdrawal. The wording is Pleidiol wyf i'm gwlad (Welsh for 'True am I to my country'), and derives from the national anthem of Wales, Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau.  UK banknotes are in English only.  Some shops employ bilingual signage. Welsh sometimes appears on product packaging or instructions.  The UK government has ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in respect of Welsh.[83]  The language has greatly increased its prominence since the creation of the television channel S4C in November 1982, which until digital switchover in 2010 broadcast 70 per cent of Channel 4's programming along with a majority of Welsh language shows[84] during peak viewing hours. The all-Welsh-language digital station S4C Digidol is available throughout Europe on satellite and online throughout the UK. Since the digital switchover was completed in South Wales on 31 March 2010, S4C Digidol became the main broadcasting channel and fully in Welsh. The main evening television news provided by the BBC in Welsh is available for download.[85] There is also a Welsh-language radio station, BBC Radio Cymru, which was launched in 1977.[86]  The only Welsh-language national newspaper Y Cymro (The Welshman) was published weekly until 2017, and monthly thereafter, following a change in ownership. There is no daily newspaper in Welsh. A daily newspaper called Y Byd (The World) was scheduled to be launched on 3 March 2008, but was scrapped, owing to insufficient sales of subscriptions and the Welsh Government offering only one third of the \u00a3600,000 public funding it needed.[87] There is a Welsh-language online news service which publishes news stories in Welsh called Golwg360 ('360 [degree] view').  As of March 2021, there were 58 local Welsh language community newspapers, known as Papurau Bro, in circulation.[88]  The decade around 1840 was a period of great social upheaval in Wales, manifested in the Chartist movement. In 1839, 20,000 people marched on Newport, resulting in a riot when 20 people were killed by soldiers defending the Westgate Hotel, and the Rebecca Riots where tollbooths on turnpikes were systematically destroyed.  This unrest brought the state of education in Wales to the attention of the British government since social reformers of the time considered education as a means of dealing with social ills. The Times newspaper was prominent among those who considered that the lack of education of the Welsh people was the root cause of most of the problems.  In July 1846, three commissioners, R.R.W. Lingen, Jellynger C. Symons and H.R. Vaughan Johnson, were appointed to inquire into the state of education in Wales; the Commissioners were all Anglicans and thus presumed unsympathetic to the nonconformist majority in Wales. The Commissioners presented their report to the Government on 1 July 1847 in three large blue-bound volumes. This report quickly became known in Wales as the Brad y Llyfrau Gleision (Treason of the Blue Books) since,[89] apart from documenting the state of education in Wales, the Commissioners were also free with their comments disparaging the language, nonconformity, and the morals of the Welsh people in general. An immediate effect of the report was that ordinary Welsh people began to believe that the only way to get on in the world was through the medium of English, and an inferiority complex developed about the Welsh language whose effects have not yet been completely eradicated. The historian Professor Kenneth O. Morgan referred to the significance of the report and its consequences as \"the Glencoe and the Amritsar of Welsh history\".[90]  In the later 19th century, the teaching of English in Welsh schools was generally supported by the Welsh public and parents who saw it as the language of economic advancement.[91]:\u200a453,\u200a457\u200a Virtually all teaching in the schools of Wales was in English, even in areas where the pupils barely understood English. Some schools used the Welsh Not, a piece of wood, often bearing the letters \"WN\", which was hung around the neck of any pupil caught speaking Welsh. The pupil could pass it on to any schoolmate heard speaking Welsh, with the pupil wearing it at the end of the day being punished. One of the most famous Welsh-born pioneers of higher education in Wales was Sir Hugh Owen. He made great progress in the cause of education, and more especially the University College of Wales at Aberystwyth, of which he was chief founder. He has been credited [by whom?] with the Welsh Intermediate Education Act 1889 (52 & 53 Vict c 40), following which several new Welsh schools were built. The first was completed in 1894 and named Ysgol Syr Hugh Owen.  Towards the beginning of the 20th century this policy slowly began to change, partly owing to the efforts of O.M. Edwards when he became chief inspector of schools for Wales in 1907.  The Ysgol Gymraeg Aberystwyth ('Aberystwyth Welsh School') was founded in 1939 by Sir Ifan ap Owen Edwards, the son of O.M. Edwards, as the first Welsh Primary School.[92] The headteacher was Norah Isaac. Ysgol Gymraeg Aberystwyth is still a very successful school, and now there are Welsh-language primary schools all over the country. Ysgol Glan Clwyd was established in Rhyl in 1956 as the first Welsh-medium secondary school.[93]  Welsh is now widely used in education, with 101,345 children and young people in Wales receiving their education in Welsh medium schools in 2014\/15, 65,460 in primary and 35,885 in secondary.[94] 26 per cent of all schools in Wales are defined as Welsh medium schools, with a further 7.3 per cent offering some Welsh-medium instruction to pupils.[95] 22 per cent of pupils are in schools in which Welsh is the primary language of instruction. Under the National Curriculum, it is compulsory that all students study Welsh up to the age of 16 as either a first or a second language.[96] Some students choose to continue with their studies through the medium of Welsh for the completion of their A-levels as well as during their college years. All local education authorities in Wales have schools providing bilingual or Welsh-medium education.[97] The remainder study Welsh as a second language in English-medium schools. Specialist teachers of Welsh called Athrawon Bro support the teaching of Welsh in the National Curriculum. Welsh is also taught in adult education classes. The Welsh Government has recently set up six centres of excellence in the teaching of Welsh for Adults, with centres in North Wales,[98] Mid Wales, South West, Glamorgan, Gwent, and Cardiff.  The ability to speak Welsh or to have Welsh as a qualification is desirable for certain career choices in Wales, such as teaching or customer service.[99] All universities in Wales teach courses in the language, with many undergraduate and post-graduate degree programmes offered in the medium of Welsh, ranging from law, modern languages, social sciences, and also other sciences such as biological sciences. Aberystwyth, Cardiff, Bangor, and Swansea have all had chairs in Welsh since their virtual establishment, and all their schools of Welsh are successful centres for the study of the Welsh language and its literature, offering a BA in Welsh as well as post-graduate courses. At all Welsh universities and the Open University, students have the right to submit assessed work and sit exams in Welsh even if the course was taught in English (usually the only exception is where the course requires demonstrating proficiency in another language). Following a commitment made in the One Wales coalition government between Labour and Plaid Cymru, the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol (Welsh Language National College) was established. The purpose of the federal structured college, spread out between all the universities of Wales, is to provide and also advance Welsh medium courses and Welsh medium scholarship and research in Welsh universities. There is also a Welsh-medium academic journal called Gwerddo ('Oasis'), which is a platform for academic research in Welsh and is published quarterly. There have been calls for more teaching of Welsh in English-medium schools.  When conducting applicants' professional reviews for Chartered Engineer status, the Institution of Engineering and Technology accepts applications in Welsh and will conduct face-to-face interviews in Welsh if requested to do so. One of the requirements for Chartered Engineer is also to be able to communicate effectively in English.  Like many of the world's languages, the Welsh language has seen an increased use and presence on the internet, ranging from formal lists of terminology in a variety of fields[100] to Welsh language interfaces for Microsoft Windows XP and up, Microsoft Office, LibreOffice, OpenOffice.org, Mozilla Firefox and a variety of Linux distributions, and on-line services to blogs kept in Welsh.[101] Wikipedia has had a Welsh version since July 2003 and Facebook since 2009.  In 2006 the Welsh Language Board launched a free software pack which enabled the use of SMS predictive text in Welsh.[102] At the National Eisteddfod of Wales 2009, a further announcement was made by the Welsh Language Board that the mobile phone company Samsung was to work with the network provider Orange to provide the first mobile phone in the Welsh language,[103] with the interface and the T9 dictionary on the Samsung S5600 available in the Welsh language. The model, available with the Welsh language interface, has been available since 1 September 2009, with plans to introduce it on other networks.[104]  On Android devices, both the built-in Google Keyboard and user-created keyboards can be used.[105] iOS devices have fully supported the Welsh language since the release of iOS 8 in September 2014. Users can switch their device to Welsh to access apps that are available in Welsh. Date and time on iOS is also localised, as shown by the built-in Calendar application, as well as certain third-party apps that have been localised.[106][107]  Secure communications are often difficult to achieve in wartime. Just as Navajo code talkers were used by the United States military during World War II, the Royal Welch Fusiliers, a Welsh regiment serving in Bosnia, used Welsh for emergency communications that needed to be secure.[108]  In 2017, parliamentary rules were amended to allow the use of Welsh when the Welsh Grand Committee meets at Westminster. The change did not alter the rules about debates within the House of Commons, where only English can be used.[109]  In February 2018, Welsh was first used when the Welsh Secretary, Alun Cairns, delivered his welcoming speech at a sitting of the committee. He said, \"I am proud to be using the language I grew up speaking, which is not only important to me, my family and the communities Welsh MPs represent, but is also an integral part of Welsh history and culture\".[110][111][112]  In November 2008, the Welsh language was used at a meeting of the European Union's Council of Ministers for the first time. The Heritage Minister Alun Ffred Jones addressed his audience in Welsh and his words were interpreted into the EU's 23 official languages. The official use of the language followed years of campaigning. Jones said \"In the UK we have one of the world's major languages, English, as the mother tongue of many. But there is a diversity of languages within our islands. I am proud to be speaking to you in one of the oldest of these, Welsh, the language of Wales.\" He described the breakthrough as \"more than [merely] symbolic\" saying \"Welsh might be one of the oldest languages to be used in the UK, but it remains one of the most vibrant. Our literature, our arts, our festivals, our great tradition of song all find expression through our language. And this is a powerful demonstration of how our culture, the very essence of who we are, is expressed through language.\"[113]  Jill Evans MEP used Welsh in a number of speeches in the European Parliament. In 2004, her using Welsh was the first use of the language in the European Parliament.[114] The last time Welsh was spoken in the European Parliament was during Evans' last speech shortly before Brexit.[115]  A greeting in Welsh is one of the 55 languages included on the Voyager Golden Record chosen to be representative of Earth in NASA's Voyager programme launched in 1977.[116] The greetings are unique to each language, with the Welsh greeting being Iechyd da i chwi yn awr ac yn oesoedd, which translates into English as \"Good health to you now and forever\".[117][118]  Welsh supplements its core Brittonic vocabulary (words such as wy \"egg\", carreg \"stone\") with hundreds of word lemmas borrowed from Latin,[119] such as (ffenestr 'window' < Latin fenestra, gwin 'wine' < Latin vinum). It also borrows words from English, such as (silff 'shelf', gi\u00e2t 'gate').  The phonology of Welsh includes a number of sounds that do not occur in English and are typologically rare in European languages. The voiceless alveolar lateral fricative [\u026c], the voiceless nasals [m\u0325], [n\u0325] and [\u014b\u030a], and the voiceless alveolar trill [r\u0325] are distinctive features of the Welsh language. Stress usually falls on the penultimate syllable in polysyllabic words, and the word-final unstressed syllable receives a higher pitch than the stressed syllable.  Symbols in parentheses are either allophones, or found only in loanwords.  The vowels \/\u0268\u031e\/ and \/\u0268\/ are only found in Northern varieties of Welsh. In the South these have merged with \/\u026a\/ and \/i\/ in all cases.  Welsh is written in a Latin alphabet of 29 letters, of which eight are digraphs treated as single letters for collation, for example fy comes before ffrwyth in the dictionary:  In contrast to English practice, \u27e8w\u27e9 and \u27e8y\u27e9 are considered vowel letters in Welsh along with \u27e8a, e, i, o, u\u27e9.  \u27e8j\u27e9 was not used traditionally, but is now used in many everyday words borrowed from English, like jam ('jam'), j\u00f4c ('joke') and garej ('garage'). \u27e8k, q, v, x, z\u27e9 are used in some technical terms, like kilogram, volt and zero, but in all cases can be, and often are, replaced by Welsh letters (same pronunciation): cilogram, folt and sero.[120] \u27e8k\u27e9 was in common use until the 16th century, but was dropped at the time of the publication of the New Testament in Welsh, as William Salesbury explained: \"\u27e8c\u27e9 for \u27e8k\u27e9, because the printers have not so many as the Welsh requireth\". This change was not popular at the time.[121]  The most common diacritic is the circumflex (called to bach in Welsh, lit. 'little roof'),[122] which usually disambiguates long vowels, most often in the case of homographs, where the vowel is short in one word and long in the other: e.g. man ('place') vs m\u00e2n ('fine, small').   Welsh morphology has much in common with that of the other modern Insular Celtic languages, such as the use of initial consonant mutations and of so-called \"conjugated prepositions\" (prepositions that fuse with the personal pronouns that are their object). Welsh nouns belong to one of two grammatical genders, masculine and feminine, but they are not inflected for case. Welsh has a variety of different endings and other methods to indicate the plural, and two endings to indicate the singular (technically the singulative) of some nouns. In spoken Welsh, verbal features are indicated primarily by the use of auxiliary verbs rather than by the inflection of the main verb. In literary Welsh, on the other hand, inflection of the main verb is usual.  The canonical word order in Welsh is verb\u2013subject\u2013object (VSO).  Colloquial Welsh inclines very strongly towards the use of auxiliaries with its verbs, as in English. The present tense is constructed with bod ('to be') as an auxiliary verb, with the main verb appearing as a verbnoun (used in a way loosely equivalent to an infinitive) after the particle yn:  There, mae is a third-person singular present indicative form of bod, and mynd is the verb-noun meaning \"to go\". The imperfect is constructed in a similar manner, as are the periphrastic forms of the future and conditional tenses.  In the preterite, future and conditional mood tenses, there are inflected forms of all verbs, which are used in the written language. However, speech now more commonly uses the verbnoun together with an inflected form of gwneud ('do'), so \"I went\" can be Mi es i or Mi wnes i fynd ('I did go'). Mi is an example of a preverbal particle; such particles are common in Welsh, though less so in the spoken language.  Welsh lacks separate pronouns for constructing subordinate clauses; instead, special verb forms or relative pronouns that appear identical to some preverbal particles are used.  The Welsh for \"I like Rhodri\" is Dw i'n hoffi Rhodri (word for word, \"am I [the] liking [of] Rhodri\"), with Rhodri in a possessive relationship with hoffi. With personal pronouns, the possessive form of the personal pronoun is used, as in \"I like him\": [Dw i'n ei hoffi], literally, \"am I his liking\" \u2013 \"I like you\" is [Dw i'n dy hoffi] ('am I your liking'). Very informally, the pronouns are often heard in their normal subject\/object form and aping English word order: Dw i'n hoffi ti ('Am I liking you').  In colloquial Welsh, possessive pronouns, whether they are used to mean \"my\", \"your\", etc. or to indicate the direct object of a verbnoun, are commonly reinforced by the use of the corresponding personal pronoun after the noun or verbnoun: ei d\u0177 e \"his house\" (literally \"his house of him\"), Dw i'n dy hoffi di \"I like you\" ('I am [engaged in the action of] your liking of you'), etc. The \"reinforcement\" (or, simply, \"redoubling\") adds no emphasis in the colloquial register. While the possessive pronoun alone may be used, especially in more formal registers, as shown above, it is considered incorrect to use only the personal pronoun. Such usage is nevertheless sometimes heard in very colloquial speech, mainly among young speakers: Ble 'dyn ni'n mynd? T\u0177 ti neu d\u0177 fi? ('Where are we going? Your house or my house?').  Welsh is a moderately inflecting language. Verbs inflect at least for person, number and mood, whilst nouns do for number and there is a masculine feminine distinction, of which the latter is marked via consonant mutation.  Colloquial and literary grammar show more differences than in English.  The traditional counting system used in the Welsh language is vigesimal, i.e. it is based on twenties, as in standard French numbers 70 (soixante-dix, literally \"sixty-ten\") to 99 (quatre-vingt-dix-neuf, literally \"four twenty nineteen\"). Welsh numbers from 11 to 14 are \"x on ten\" (e.g. un ar ddeg: 11), 16 to 19 are \"x on fifteen\" (e.g. un ar bymtheg: 16), though 18 is deunaw, \"two nines\"; numbers from 21 to 39 are \"1\u201319 on twenty\"(e.g. deg ar hugain: 30), 40 is deugain \"two twenties\", 60 is trigain \"three twenties\", etc. This form continues to be used, especially by older people, and it is obligatory in certain circumstances (such as telling the time, and in ordinal numbers).[123]  There is also a decimal counting system, which has become relatively widely used, though less so in giving the time, ages, and dates (it features no ordinal numbers). This system originated in Patagonian Welsh and was subsequently introduced to Wales in the 1940s.[124] Whereas 39 in the vigesimal system is pedwar ar bymtheg ar hugain ('four on fifteen on twenty') or even deugain namyn un ('two twenty minus one'), in the decimal system it is tri deg naw ('three tens nine').  Although there is only one word for \"one\" (un), it triggers the soft mutation[disambiguation needed] (treiglad meddal) of feminine nouns, where possible, other than those beginning with \"ll\" or \"rh\". There are separate masculine and feminine forms of the numbers 'two' (dau and dwy), 'three' (tri and tair) and 'four' (pedwar and pedair), which must agree with the grammatical gender of the objects being counted. The objects being counted appear in the singular, not plural form.  The differences between the dialects of modern colloquial Welsh are insignificant in comparison with the difference between the spoken and standard language. The latter is much more formal and is, among other things, the language of the Welsh translations of the Bible (but the Beibl Cymraeg Newydd \u2013 \"New Welsh Bible\" \u2013 is much less formal in language than the traditional 1588 Bible). Among the characteristics of the literary language, in comparison with the spoken language, are more frequent use of conjugated verb forms, a change in the use of certain tenses (for example, the literary imperfect in modern language has the meaning of the subjunctive mood), a reduction in the frequency of the use of pronouns (since the information they convey is usually conveyed by forms of inflected verbs and prepositions) and a more pronounced tendency to replace English borrowings with native Welsh words.[125]  For example: consider the question \"Do you want a cuppa [a cup of tea]?\" In Gwynedd this would typically be Dach chi isio paned? while in the south of Dyfed one would be more likely to hear Ych chi'n moyn dishgled? (though in other parts of the South one would not be surprised to hear Ych chi isie paned? as well, among other possibilities). An example of a pronunciation difference is the tendency in some southern dialects to palatalise the letter \"s\", e.g. mis (Welsh for 'month'), usually pronounced IPA: [mi\u02d0s], but as IPA: [mi\u02d0\u0283] in parts of the south. This normally occurs next to a high front vowel like \/i\/, although exceptions include the pronunciation of sut \"how\" as IPA: [\u0283\u028ad] in the southern dialects (compared with northern IPA: [s\u0268t]).  Although modern understanding often splits Welsh into northern (Gogledd) and southern (De) 'dialects', the traditional classification of four Welsh dialects remains the most academically useful:  A fifth dialect is Patagonian Welsh, which has developed since the start of Y Wladfa (the Welsh settlement in Argentina) in 1865; it includes Spanish loanwords and terms for local features, but a survey in the 1970s showed that the language in Patagonia is consistent throughout the lower Chubut Valley and in the Andes.  Subdialects exist within the main dialects (such as the Cofi dialect). The 1989 book Cymraeg, Cymr\u00e2g, Cymr\u00eag: Cyflwyno'r Tafodieithoedd (Welsh for 'Welsh, Welsh, Welsh: Introducing the Dialects')[127] was accompanied by a cassette containing recordings of 14 different speakers demonstrating aspects of different regional dialects. The book also refers to the earlier Linguistic Geography of Wales (1973)[128] as describing six different regions which could be identified as having words specific to those regions.  In the 1970s, there was an attempt to standardise the Welsh language by teaching Cymraeg Byw ('Living Welsh') \u2013 a colloquially-based generic form of Welsh,[129] but the attempt largely failed because it did not encompass the regional differences used by Welsh-speakers.  Modern Welsh can be considered to fall broadly into two main registers\u2014Colloquial Welsh (Cymraeg llafar) and Literary Welsh (Cymraeg llenyddol). Colloquial Welsh is used in most speech and informal writing. Literary Welsh is closer to the form of Welsh standardised by the 1588 translation of the Bible and is found in official documents and other formal registers, including much literature. As a standardised form, literary Welsh shows little if any of the dialectal variation found in colloquial Welsh. Some differences include:  Amongst the characteristics of the literary, as against the spoken language are a higher dependence on inflected verb forms, different usage of some of the tenses, less frequent use of pronouns (since the information is usually conveyed in the verb\/preposition inflections) and a much lesser tendency to substitute English loanwords for native Welsh words. In addition, more archaic pronouns and forms of mutation may be observed in Literary Welsh.  The differences between dialects of modern spoken Welsh pale into insignificance compared to the difference between some forms of the spoken language and the most formal constructions of the literary language. The latter is considerably more conservative and is the language used in Welsh translations of the Bible, amongst other things \u2013 although the 2004 Beibl Cymraeg Newydd (Welsh for 'New Welsh Bible') is significantly less formal than the traditional 1588 Bible. Gareth King, author of a popular Welsh grammar, observes, \"The difference between these two is much greater than between the virtually identical colloquial and literary forms of English.\"[131] A grammar of Literary Welsh can be found in A Grammar of Welsh by Stephen J. Williams[132] or more completely in Gramadeg y Gymraeg by Peter Wynn Thomas.[133] (No comprehensive grammar of formal literary Welsh exists in English.) An English-language guide to colloquial Welsh forms and register and dialect differences is Dweud Eich Dweud by Ceri Jones.[134]  Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:  Genir pawb yn rhydd ac yn gydradd \u00e2'i gilydd mewn urddas a hawliau. Fe'u cynysgaeddir \u00e2 rheswm a chydwybod, a dylai pawb ymddwyn y naill at y llall mewn ysbryd cymodlon.[135]  All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.[136] "},{"title":"Huddersfield","content":"  Huddersfield is a market town in the Metropolitan Borough of Kirklees in West Yorkshire, England. It is the administrative centre and largest settlement in the Kirklees district. The town is in the foothills of the Pennines. The River Holme's confluence into the similar-sized Colne is to the south of the town centre which then flows into the Calder in the north eastern outskirts of the town.  The rivers around the town provided soft water required for textile treatment in large weaving sheds; this made it a prominent mill town with an economic boom in the early part of the Victorian era Industrial Revolution. The town centre has much neoclassical Victorian architecture. An example is its railway station, which is a Grade I listed building described by John Betjeman as \"the most splendid station fa\u00e7ade in England\".[2] It won the Europa Nostra award for architecture.  Huddersfield hosts the University of Huddersfield and three colleges: Greenhead College, Kirklees College and Huddersfield New College. The town is the birthplace of rugby league with the local team, Huddersfield Giants, playing in the Super League. It also has a professional football team called Huddersfield Town, that currently competes in the Championship, as well as two Rugby Union clubs Huddersfield R.U.F.C. and Huddersfield YM RUFC. Notable people from the town include two-time British Prime Minister Harold Wilson (for Labour), film star James Mason born in the town and Jodie Whittaker, the 13th actor to play Doctor Who, was born in Skelmanthorpe.  The town has been classed under Yorkshire, the West Riding of Yorkshire and West Yorkshire for statistics throughout its history. The town's population in 1961 was 130,652 with an increase to 162,949 at the 2011 census; it is in the West Yorkshire Built-up Area.[3][4] The town is 14 miles (23\u00a0km) south-west of Leeds, 12 miles (19\u00a0km) west of Wakefield, 23 miles (37\u00a0km) north-west of Sheffield and 24 miles (39\u00a0km) north-east of Manchester.  Local settlement dates back over 4,000 years.[5] Castle Hill, a major landmark, was the site of an Iron Age hill fort. The remains of a Roman fort were unearthed in the mid 18th century at Slack near Outlane, west of the town.[6]  The earliest surviving record of the place name is in the Domesday Book of 1086, Oderesfelt. It appears as Hudresfeld in a Yorkshire charter from 1121 to 1127, and as Huderesfeld in subsidy rolls in 1297. The name meaning has not complicated with the shifts of English, remaining 'Hud(d)er's field'.[7]  The modern name is pronounced without a word-initial \/h\/ in the local dialect, a trait ironically and independently shared by many Norman scribes' dialects of the Domesday Book era (see Old and modern French).  Huddersfield has been a market town since Anglo-Saxon times. The market cross is on Market Place.  The manor of Huddersfield was owned by long lease by the de Lacy becoming Lacey family until its 1322 takeback by the Crown. In 1599, William Ramsden bought it, and the Ramsden family continued to own the manor, which came to be known as the Ramsden Estate, until 1920. During their ownership they supported the development of the town.  Closest wooded uplands in the inner part of the town's green belt, the town centre and the crest of the Pennines to the west: semi-panorama from Castle Hill. Three converted neoclassical mill sheds are in the foreground. Sir John Ramsden, 3rd Baronet built the Huddersfield Cloth Hall in 1766 and his son the fourth baronet was responsible for Sir John Ramsden's Canal in 1780. The Ramsdens endorsed the railway in the first wave of national railway building, in the 1840s.[8]  Huddersfield was a centre of civil unrest during this phase of the Industrial Revolution in which Europe saw frequent wars during and after which, as to those most acutely affecting Britain, cloth trade slumped which could be compounded by local crops failure, many local weavers faced starvation and losing their livelihood due to the new, mechanised weaving sheds.  Luddites began destroying the great mills, sheds and machinery at such times; one of the most notorious attacks was on Cartwright \u2013 a Huddersfield mill-owner, who had a reputation for cruelty \u2013 and his Rawfolds Mill. Kirkpatrick Sale describes how an army platoon was stationed at Huddersfield to deal with these; at its peak, having about a thousand soldiers and ten thousand civilians. Luddites thus began to focus criminal damage on nearby towns and villages (less well-protected); their most damaging act was to destroy Foster's Mill at Horbury \u2013 a village about 10 miles (16 kilometres) east.[9] The government campaign that crushed the movement was provoked by a murder that took place in Huddersfield. William Horsfall, a mill-owner and a passionate prosecutor of Luddites, was killed in 1812.[10] Although the movement faded out, Parliament began to increase welfare provision for those out of work, and introduce regulations to improve conditions in the mills.  Two Prime Ministers spent part of their childhood in Huddersfield: Harold Wilson, born locally who attended Royds Hall School, and H. H. Asquith. Wilson is commemorated by a statue on the large front square (forecourt) to the town's station.  In 1920, the Corporation bought the Ramsden Estate from that family, that had owned much of the town at least as to the reversion of long leases (a minor, overarching interest) since 1599, for \u00a31.3\u00a0million. The town became \"the town that bought itself\". Most of the keynote central building freeholds belong to the local authority, as in a few towns in Britain such as Basingstoke.[8]  Huddersfield was incorporated as a municipal borough in the ancient West Riding of Yorkshire in 1868. The borough comprised the thus sidelined civil parishes of Almondbury, Dalton, Huddersfield, Lindley-cum-Quarmby and Lockwood, later dissolved. When the West Riding County Council was formed in 1889, Huddersfield became a county borough, exempt from its control. A more confined Huddersfield seat than the early 20th century scope has been represented by Labour since its creation in 1983 and is, by size of majority and length of tenure, a strongly-Labour leaning seat.  Kirklees was the first part of the country to have a Green or other environmentalist party councillor \u2013 Nicholas Harvey \u2013 he was instrumental in protesting against the intended closure of the Settle and Carlisle Railway line.[11] The council has councillors of Labour, Conservative Party and Liberal Democrat parties; these retained the deposit, reaching more than 5% of the vote in the last general election (for an MP who serves in the House of Commons).  Huddersfield expanded in 1937, assimilating parts of the Golcar, Linthwaite, and South Crosland urban districts.[12] The county borough was abolished in 1974 and its former area was combined with that of other districts to form the Metropolitan Borough of Kirklees in West Yorkshire.  Council bids to gain support for city status were rejected by the people in a poll held by the Huddersfield Daily Examiner; the council did not apply for that status in the 2000 or 2002 competitions.[13]  Huddersfield had a strong Liberal tradition up to the 1950s reflected in several Liberal social clubs. The current Member of Parliament (MP) for the Huddersfield constituency is Barry Sheerman, a Labour Co-operative MP.  The town's population in 1961 had reached 130,652.[14]  Per the United Kingdom Census 2001 the population of the town's urban sub-area of the West Yorkshire Urban Area was 146,234, and that of the former extent of the county borough was 121,620. The wider South Kirklees had a population of 216,011.  Huddersfield has the merger of the shallow valley floors of the River Colne and the Holme south of the town centre. This is in the eastern foothills of the Pennines which blend into the moorlands of the South Pennines west of the town.  As with all of West Yorkshire a temperate oceanic climate exists, wetter than the low plains rain shadow proper towards East Yorkshire but drier than Cumbria. It is mild for the latitude \u2013 overnight frosts are quite frequent in winter yet daytime tends to exceed such temperatures due to onshore breezes from around Britain and as the Gulf Stream moderates temperatures. Summers are usually warm, punctuated by frequent rainy and hot spells. Winters are usually cool and damp, punctuated by frequent cold spells where snow is possible, especially on higher ground. According to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Huddersfield is certified as Cfb.  After boundary changes in 2004, Huddersfield now covers eight of the twenty-three electoral wards for Kirklees Council. Neighbouring wards in the Colne Valley, Holme Valley, and Kirkburton are often considered to be part of Huddersfield though they are predominantly semi-rural. The very centre of town forms the Newsome ward of councillors. Eight wards make up Huddersfield proper; these with populations, extent and constituent suburbs (mid-year 2005 estimates) are:  Huddersfield is within a green belt region that extends into the Kirklees borough and wider surrounding counties. It is in place to reduce urban sprawl, prevent the towns in the West Yorkshire Urban Area conurbation from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, encourage brownfield reuse, and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas, and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building.[24]  The green belt surrounds the Huddersfield built-up area, a much-wooded buffer zone. Larger outlying communities such as Upper Hopton, Grange Moor, Highburton, Farnley Tyas, Netherton, Honley, Outlane, Slaithwaite, Wellhouse are exempt from this. Nearby smaller villages, hamlets and rural areas such as Thurgory, Gawthorpe Green, Bog Green, Upper Heaton, Wilberlee, South Crosland, Rushfield Bridge, and Bank End see their unbuilt land included in the designation. Much semi-rural land on the fringes forms the rest. It was chiefly defined in the 1960s,[24] and across Kirklees covers about 70%, i.e. 23,050 hectares (57,000 acres) (2017, excluding the Peak District National Park).[25][24]  A subsidiary aim is to encourage play, sport and leisure,[24] through woodland, moor, streams, green meadows, fields, small bogs. Features are:  West of Marsden, Meltham and Holmbridge, it borders the north limb of the Peak District National Park.  As of 2021, the town of Huddersfield's population was enumerated at 141,692, and its ethnic makeup was 66% White, 20.4% Asian,  5.6% Black, 5.2% Mixed, 2% Other and 1% Arab.[26]  The town has many churches, mosques, temples and synagogues. These include Christian denominations: the Church of England, Baptists, Presbyterians and Congregationalists (sometimes as their main fusion the United Reformed Church), Methodism, Quakers,[27] and the Roman Catholic Church. Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, the Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormonism and Sikhism all have congregational buildings.  The town's religious makeup was 39% Christian, 37.4% No Religion, 20.4% Muslim, and has small Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist and Jewish communities.[26]  Huddersfield is a manufacturing town, despite the university being the largest employer. Historically the town produced woollen textiles. This area of business, along with the chemical and engineering industries that emerged to support the manufacture of textiles, was the basis of the town's nineteenth and early twentieth century prosperity. The number of people who work in textiles has declined greatly, but the surviving companies produce large quantities of woollen products with little labour. The town is home to textile, chemical and engineering companies, including Brook Motors Ltd founded by Ernest Brook in 1904. Against conventional wisdom, he started making alternating current electric motors, and he did this in one room with two assistants and starting capital of just \u00a3300. On its 50th anniversary in 1954 it employed more than 2,000 people and, with Ernest's sons Frank and Jack in charge, was the largest exclusive producer of AC motors in the world, and had a turnover of \u00a34,500,000. That same year Brook Motors Ltd operated 10 factories in Huddersfield, its biggest being Empress Works on St Thomas's Road, and opened one at Barugh Green, Barnsley. Other local manufacturers are Cummins Turbo Technologies, founded in 1952 as Holset by Messrs. Holmes and Croset.[28] (turbochargers), David Brown Gear systems (industrial gearing), Huddersfield Fine Worsteds (textiles), Taylor & Lodge (textiles), C & J Antich (textiles), Syngenta AG (agro-chemicals), Pennine Radio Limited (electronics transformers and sheet metalworking) and a large number of niche manufacturers, such as Dual Seal Glass (maker of spandrel glass panels[29]) and Ellis Furniture (producer of kitchen and bathroom furniture).[30] Huddersfield is home to Andrew Jones Pies, a regional award-winning pie-maker, and Mamas and Papas, a manufacturer and retailer of prams, pushchairs and related items and specialist pneumatics supplier Shelley Automation Ltd.  Huddersfield Royal Infirmary is in Lindley. Medical services are split between there and the Calderdale Royal Hospital at Salterhebble, near Halifax. Kirkwood Hospice provides care for the terminally ill, and is dependent on donations and charitable gifts. Princess Royal Hospital provided maternity facilities until the risks of not being able to get an ambulance to A&E in the event of complications were judged to outweigh the benefits of specialist service provision. It now functions as a day clinic, family planning consultation centre and GUM Clinic. A decision to move most maternity services provided by the Calderdale & Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust to the Calderdale Royal Hospital ended the provision in 2007, despite strong local opposition. The campaign was led by Save Huddersfield NHS which elected a councillor, Dr Jackie Grunsell in the Crosland Moor ward.  In January 2016 plans were announced to close the A&E department of Huddersfield Royal Infirmary and have all emergency cases go to Calderdale Royal instead. This sparked uproar in local communities as it would mean journeys from some areas of over 40 minutes to and from the hospital assuming that the main road into Halifax was not congested, as it frequently is.[31]  The former St. Luke's Hospital in Crosland Moor mostly provided geriatric and psychiatric care. It closed in 2011 and the land was sold to a developer, this land is now home to Fitzwilliam Grange, a housing estate.  Platform 1 is a charity established in 2018 and provides a space and advice for men struggling with mental health.  The Lawrence Batley Theatre, opened in 1994, in what was once the largest Wesleyan Chapel in the world,[32] and presents dance, drama, comedy, music and exhibitions and is the base for Full Body & the Voice, a company focusing on the integration of disabled people into mainstream theatre. Kelly Rowlands also holds the 2003 Line Dancing championship Record.  The John Smith's Stadium, (formerly the Galpharm Stadium and Alfred McAlpine Stadium), is a multi-use sports stadium with a gym, swimming pool, spa and offers sporting classes. The stadium is home to Huddersfield Giants and Huddersfield Town football team. Adjacent the stadium is an Odeon cinema (formerly UCI).  There are many pubs, restaurants and night clubs, one of which, Tokyo, which closed in 2019, occupies the former Huddersfield County Court, a 19th-century Grade II listed building. The oldest pub is The Parish,[a] trading since 1720.  Huddersfield has a large and diverse retail shopping area, enclosed within the town's ring road, compared with other towns of its size. There are three shopping areas: Kingsgate, The Packhorse Precinct and The Piazza Centre. The Piazza offers an outdoor shopping mall near the public library, with a grassed area, used for relaxation and events throughout the year such as entertainment, international markets and iceskating in winter. Through the adjacent Market Arcade is a covered market hall, which has listed building status, due in part to its distinctive roof formed by hyperbolic paraboloids. It is adjacent to the town hall and public library. An open market trades next to Tesco, on the other side of the town centre.  The town centre is home to several national high street retailers and chain stores. There are also a variety of small specialist and independent shops, many in the three-storey Victorian shopping arcade, Byram Arcade, on street, Westgate.  However over the last decade many shops have closed down causing a general decline of the town centre.[33] Most notability the closure of British Home Stores (BHS) in 2016 left a large shopping unit empty in The Piazza Centre. In 2019 Marks & Spencer announced 17 closures within the UK, one of these was the Huddersfield store.[34]  Huddersfield Choral Society founded in 1836, claims to be the UK's leading choral society. Its history was chronicled in the book 'And The Glory',[35] written to commemorate the society's 150th anniversary in 1986 \u2013 its title derived from a chorus in Handel's landmark Oratorio Messiah.  The annual Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival is held in the town which is also home to the Huddersfield Philharmonic Orchestra and the Huddersfield Singers.  On Christmas Day 1977, the Sex Pistols played their last two British shows, a matinee for the children of striking firefighters, at Ivanhoe's nightclub, before embarking on their ill-fated US tour which saw the group's acrimonious collapse. In the early-mid-1990s, Flex, an underground Jungle\/Drum 'n' Bass record label, was founded by musician and BBC Radio 1Xtra DJ, L Double. In 2000 another independent record label Chocolate Fireguard Records was founded by singer Pat Fulgoni who developed a three-stage community music event, Timeless Festival, in Ravensknowle Park, featuring a range of electronica, hip hop and rock music.  There are other annual music festivals held in the town and surrounding area, examples being the Marsden Jazz Festival,[36] Mrs Sunderland,[37] Electric Spring,[38] Janet Beaumont, the Holmfirth Festivals, and the Haydn Wood (Linthwaite). The Haydn Wood (for under 21s) and Mrs Sunderland festival focus on musical and oratorial performance. The Electric Spring festival is an exploration of electronic and experimental music, featuring the 50-channel, 64-loudspeaker Huddersfield Immersive Sound System (HISS). The Mrs Sunderland Music festival is the second oldest in the United Kingdom, started in 1889 lasting for nine days each year. Free music concerts have been put on for the town, including bands such as the Ordinary Boys, the Script and Elliott Minor. There are many local choirs, youth and adult, a noted example of the latter being the Honley Male Voice Choir.[39] Home-grown musical talent of all kinds is complemented by the student intake to the University of Huddersfield's music department. \"The Sheriff of Huddersfield\" is a song by heavy metal band Iron Maiden on the B-side of their 1986 single \"Wasted Years\", written about their co-manager Rod Smallwood, leaving his home town of Huddersfield and struggling to settle into life in Los Angeles. Huddersfield is home to thrash metal band Evile, dance rock band Kava Kava, the birthplace of the synthpop musician Billy Currie (of Ultravox and Visage), and the hard rock bassist John McCoy who played with Neo and Gillan.  Huddersfield Art Gallery occupies the top floor of the library at Princess Alexandra Walk. It has an extensive collection featuring Francis Bacon, L.S. Lowry and Henry Moore, as well as significant regional artists. It has other halls for its temporary exhibitions for established and emerging artists.  Ian Berry was born in Netherton, Huddersfield and was educated in the town and went to Greenhead College[40][41] and is internationally renowned for his art using only denim jeans and was named as one of the top 30 artists under 30 in the world in 2013.[42][43] In 1996 aged 11 he won the Huddersfield Daily Examiner 125th Birthday competition that saw his design printed on to mugs, tea towels and posters.[44][45]  Huddersfield Festival of Light takes place annually in December,[46] usually in the town centre adjacent to the railway station. Each year there is a performance by a theatre company. The finale is a firework display. The 2007 show was performed by French company Plasticiens Volants, which used large inflatable sea creatures in a parade through the streets as they told the story of 'Pearl'. The 2005 and 2008 performances were by the Valencian artists Xarxa Teatre. The 2010 festival featured Belgian company Company Tol and their suspension act \u2013 Corazon de Angeles (Angels' Heart) and ended on 5 December with fireworks in St George's Square.  Huddersfield has a long-established Saint Patrick's Day Parade on c. 17 March.  Huddersfield Caribbean Carnival in mid-July, begins with a procession from the Hudawi Cultural Centre in Hillhouse, through the town centre to Greenhead Park where troupes display their costumes on stage. Caribbean food, fairground rides and various stalls and attractions are available. A \"young blud\" stage presents Hip Hop, UK garage, RnB and bassline.[47]  The Huddersfield Literature Festival is held annually in the town,[48] and features author events, creative writing classes and poetry nights, and sometimes creative writing competitions.  Since 2016 the town has a growing one-day Onwards Festival for music and arts.[49] It celebrates local music, art, food and drink.  Its spirit is organisation like a pub crawl, moving between venues to experience different tastes of culture.  Its first year saw 10 live music acts, an exhibition and some live art performances, with payment for the later events.  Huddersfield has an abundance of Victorian architecture.[50] The most conspicuous landmark is the Victoria Tower on Castle Hill. Overlooking the town, the tower was constructed to mark Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee Year in 1897. A picture of the Victoria Tower features on the New Zealand wine Castle Hill.  Huddersfield Town Hall is a municipal building in the town: it seats up to 1,200 people and hosts events ranging from classical to comedy and from choral to community events.[51]  The colonnaded Huddersfield railway station in St George's Square was once described as 'a stately home with trains in it', and by Sir Nikolaus Pevsner as \"one of the best early railway stations in England\".[52] A bronze statue of Huddersfield-born Sir Harold Wilson, Prime Minister 1964\u20131970 and 1974\u20131976 stands in front of its entrance.  The George Hotel designed by William Wallen was built by Wallen and Charles Child in 1850. The hotel's Italianate fa\u00e7ade became Huddersfield's adopted architectural style as the town developed over following decade.[53] The hotel was the site of the birthplace of Rugby league in August 1895.[54]  St Peter's Church (Huddersfield Parish Church) replaced a church of the 11th century and is adjacent to the town centre, on Byram Street near the Pack Horse Centre. The church was built in 1838.  Holy Trinity Church, just outside the town centre was built between 1816 and 1819.  The Pack Horse Centre is a covered pedestrianised shopping area constructed over a cobblestone street, Pack Horse Yard, renamed Pack Horse Walk. Pack horses carried merchandise over pack-horse routes across the Pennines before turnpike roads and railways improved transportation. The pedestrian link passes from Kirkgate, across King Street and along Victoria Lane, by the Shambles, to the Piazza and the distinctive market hall at Queensgate, which was built to replace the old Shambles Market Hall in the early 1970s.[55] Next to the Piazza is the Victorian town hall and the 1930s public library.  Beaumont Park about two miles (three kilometres) south of the town centre was bequeathed to the town in the 1880s, by Henry Frederick Beaumont (\"Beaumont's of Whitley\" estate) and was opened on 13 October 1883, by Prince Leopold, fourth son of Queen Victoria, and his wife Princess Helena of Waldeck and Pyrmont (Duke and Duchess of Albany). It is a fine example of a Victorian era public park with water cascades, bandstand and woodland.  The former St Paul's Church on Queensgate has statutory recognition and protection,[b] used for worship from 1831 to 1956. Sir John Ramsden gave its land and his family helped its extension to be built in 1883.  The foundation stone was laid by Lady Guendolen Ramsden.  The building is now part of the University of Huddersfield.[56]  The St Paul's Street drill hall was designed by Captain William Willey Cooper and completed in 1901.[57]  Greenhead Park, 3\u20448 mile (600 metres) west of the town centre, is lined with copses of various trees. A multimillion-pound restoration project, funded by the Heritage Lottery fund[58] was finished in autumn 2012.  Ravensknowle Hall, built in the late-1850s, houses the Tolson (Memorial) Museum. The museum was founded in 1919, and was originally a natural history museum. It now also holds galleries on different historical fields, like transport, textiles and the history of the town.[59]  The feature films Between Two Women and The Jealous God were filmed in and around Huddersfield. There is a Serbian film from 2007 called Hadersfild, a Serbian phonetic spelling of Huddersfield, where a character is from the town. Television productions in and around the town include:  Huddersfield is connected to the motorway network via the M1 and M62 motorways. The M1 passes about 10 miles (16 kilometres) to the east. The M62 passes about 2+1\u20442 miles (4 kilometres) to the north, and Huddersfield is linked to it by three junctions: Mount (A640, J23 \u2013 limited access), Ainley Top (A629, J24) and between Brighouse and Cooper Bridge (A644, J25).  Huddersfield Corporation built an inner ring road, part of the A62, in the 1970s. The area within now defines the town's central business district. This ended congestion within, where many roads are pedestrianised.  Main radial roads are the:  A trolleybus network operated from 1933 to 1968. Huddersfield bus station was opened by the Mayor, Councillor Mernagh on 26 March 1974, although it had not been completed.[64] It is the busiest bus station in West Yorkshire with a daily footfall of almost 35,000. Most bus services pass through the bus station. Many services are subsidised by Metro.  Huddersfield's bus operators reflect the national situation; local subsidiaries of three dominant national operators provide most services in the area: First Calderdale & Huddersfield provide most local services in Huddersfield and some services outside Kirklees with destinations including Bradford, Brighouse, Halifax, Manchester and Oldham. Arriva Yorkshire provide frequent services to Dewsbury and Leeds, and Team Pennine provide almost all services in the south east of the town. Other smaller operators include Stotts Coaches and Team Pennine. Centrebus Holdings purchased Teamdeck in May 2008, along with Stagecoach Yorkshire's Huddersfield depot.[65] In November 2006, a zero-fare town centre bus service, the Free Town Bus, was launched run by K-Line in partnership with Kirklees Council and Metro. Today this is run by Team Pennine.  Huddersfield has a comprehensive local and regional rail service but there is no direct service to London; passengers have to change at Manchester Piccadilly, Leeds, Wakefield Westgate or Mirfield.[66] Some services are subsidised by the public transport coordinator, West Yorkshire Metro. TransPennine Express runs a frequent express service to Dewsbury, Leeds and Manchester and regular services to Darlington, Hull Paragon, Liverpool Lime Street, Manchester Airport, Middlesbrough, Newcastle, Scarborough and York. There are local stopping services operated by Northern linking Huddersfield with Barnsley, Bradford Interchange, Brighouse, Dewsbury, Halifax, Leeds, Sheffield and Wakefield Kirkgate.  The Penistone Line passes through mainly rural stations towards Barnsley and Sheffield: Lockwood, Berry Brow, Honley,Brockholes, Stocksmoor, Shepley and Denby Dale.  At the station, there are two internet famous cats: black & white Felix and younger pure black Bolt. They have released merchandise and have published a book.[67]  The Huddersfield Broad Canal, originally the Sir John Ramsden Canal, and the Huddersfield Narrow Canal are both navigable by narrowboat, and the broad canal by wider craft, wind around the south side of town. To the rear of the YMCA in the Turnbridge section is an electrically operated road bridge, which is still in use, to raise the road and allow boat traffic to pass. This bridge originally used a windlass.  As well as primary and secondary schools, which cover compulsory and sixth form education for the town's population, Huddersfield has two sixth form colleges: Huddersfield New College at Salendine Nook and Greenhead College west of the town centre. Huddersfield Grammar School is the only independent school for secondary education up to age 16. The town has a further education college, Kirklees College formed following the merger of Dewsbury College and Huddersfield Technical College. Its one establishment of higher education is the University of Huddersfield, whose chancellor until 2019 was the Duke of York. The actor Patrick Stewart from Mirfield is emeritus chancellor.  Association and rugby league football codes are the main spectator sports in Huddersfield. The John Smith's Stadium is home to both professional clubs in the town. The rugby club left its Fartown home to share the association football club's ground at Leeds Road, both clubs then left Leeds Road in 1994 to share the stadium. The town also has Rugby Union clubs and the Huddersfield Rams Aussie Rules club. In May 2022 the town made national and world headlines when its 2 professional sports teams both played in finals in London on the same weekend on the 28\/29 May[68] unfortunately both clubs lost their respective finals, The Giants narrowly losing the rugby league challenge cup final to Wigan, while the Terriers also lost narrowly to Nottingham Forest in the football play off promotion final.  Its professional association football team, Huddersfield Town A.F.C. is the town's senior association football team, founded in 1908, and most seasons play in the Championship, the second highest league of the sport nationally. In 1926, the club became the first in England to win three successive league titles, a feat only three other clubs have matched.  In 1921\u201322 Huddersfield won the FA Cup and between 1923 and 1926 became the first club to win the League Championship three times in a row, an achievement matched only by three other teams. After several decades in lower divisions, Huddersfield Town FC returned to top flight football in 2017 when the club entered the Premier League for the first time.  Notable ex-players include Scottish international Denis Law, Ray Wilson, a World Cup winner with England in 1966 and Trevor Cherry, England international. Herbert Chapman, Bill Shankly, Neil Warnock and Steve Bruce are notable former Huddersfield Town managers.  Also within the town boundaries is Emley A.F.C. who were formed when the original Emley FC left for Wakefield who play in the Northern Counties East Football League and Golcar Utd who also compete in the NCEL league and share the \"HD derby\" with Emley. Shelley are also within the town's boundaries and most recently played in the West Yorkshire Association Football League having previously played alongside Emley and Golcar in the North West Counties Football League Division 1 North.  Rugby was first played in the town in 1848 and the Huddersfield Athletic Club, formed in 1864 and played its first rugby game in 1866. The town was the birthplace of rugby league. On 29 August 1895, 22 northern clubs met in the George Hotel and voted to secede from the Rugby Football Union and set up the 'Northern Rugby Football Union' which became the Rugby Football League in 1922. The Rugby League Heritage Centre was in the George Hotel's basement before the hotel closed in 2013.  Following the split of 1895, Huddersfield became a focus for rugby league.  HAC's direct successors, the Huddersfield Giants, who played the famous Fartown Ground until 1992 before sharing with the Football club,  play in the Super League. It is the top division in Europe. Huddersfield Rugby Union Football Club play in National Division Three North and Huddersfield Y.M.C.A. RUFC play in North 1 East. Huddersfield Giants, the town's rugby league club, has won the Rugby Football League Championship seven times, most recently in 1961\u201362, and the Challenge Cup six times, the last time in 1952\u201353.  The town is also home to the Huddersfield Underbank Rangers, who play in the Rugby League Conference. The club is based in Holmfirth and formed in 1884. It has launched the careers of many professional players including Harold Wagstaff, Paul Dixon and Eorl Crabtree.  After 1895 rugby union was played exclusively under the Northern Rugby Football Union until 1909 when Huddersfield Old Boys were formed to play under rugby union rules, playing nomadically at five grounds until buying farmland at Waterloo in 1919 and, in 1946, renaming the club Huddersfield RUFC. In 1969 the club was at the forefront of a revolution in English rugby when it became the first club in the country to organise mini and junior rugby teams. The innovation spread and almost every club in the country has a thriving junior section providing a production-line of home-grown talent. Junior players at Huddersfield number over 200. In 1997 the Waterloo junior grounds were sold and the 26-acre (11-hectare) former Bass Brewery site at Lockwood Park was purchased for its replacement. With the assistance of a \u00a32\u00a0million grant from Sport England, the club has transformed it into a major sports complex, conference centre and business park.  Huddersfield Rams Aussie Rules is an Australian rules football team, formed in 2008. The club played its first season in 2009 and won the Aussie Rules UK National League \u2013 Central Division and took part in the North West Division in 2010.  The Huddersfield Cricket League was founded in 1891. Huddersfield has produced multiple Yorkshire CCC cricketers including 14 internationals, such as Alec Coxon, Billy Bates and Chris Balderstone.  Huddersfield has a number of field hockey teams, many of which train at the Lockwood Park sports complex on the all-weather pitch.[69]  Motorcycle speedway racing was staged in Huddersfield in the UK pioneer year of 1928. A venue in the town staged four or five meetings. James Whitham, is a former 'British Superbike Champion'. Lepton born Tom Sykes joined the Yamaha Motor Italia World team in the 2009 World Superbike season[70] after spells in British Supersports & British Superbikes in which he finished 4th in the 2009 Season. He won his first race in World Superbikes in one of two wildcard meetings and is the 2013 World Superbike Champion.  On 6 July 2014, Stage 2 of the 2014 Tour de France from York to Sheffield passed through the town.[71]  Thirty-four people and one military (infantry) regiment have been granted the Freedom of Huddersfield, between 1889 and 1973.[72]  On 2 July 1952, in recognition of historic ties and links with the Duke of Wellington's Regiment (West Riding), the Huddersfield County Borough had conferred on the regiment the Freedom of the Town. This gave the regiment the right to march through the town with 'flags flying, bands playing and bayonets fixed'. Many of the town and district's male residents had served in the regiment during its long history. This right was technically lost when merged with Dewsbury to form Kirklees MBC. On 25 March 1979, the latter gave the Freedom of Kirklees to the 3rd battalion of the Yorkshire Volunteers; this being the Duke of Wellington's Territorial Army unit.  When the 'Dukes' were amalgamated with the Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire and the Green Howards' to form the Yorkshire Regiment on 6 June 2006 the right to march became extinct. The Regiment requested a resumed right to march. The right given by Kirklees to the 3rd battalion of the Yorkshire Volunteers did not permit any transfer to heirs or successors and effectively ceased when the battalion was amalgamated into the East and West Riding Regiment (since 2006 being the Yorkshire Regiment's 4th Battalion). Kirklees Metropolitan Borough Council amended the original 'Freedom' and transferred it to the Yorkshire Regiment, at a Freedom parade on 25 October 2008.  A number of national and internationally famous people originate from Huddersfield. Actors include Joanna Christie, James Mason, Gorden Kaye and Keith Buckley. TV playwright Sally Wainwright's award-winning dramas such as Happy Valley have made the Colne and Calder valley towns well known to television viewers. Some people have also become known through their association with Huddersfield, though they were not born there. These include the Mirfield-born actor (\"life-long\" Huddersfield Town F.C. supporter[73] and Chancellor of Huddersfield University from 2004 to 2015[74][75]), Patrick Stewart; the dancer, entertainer and TV presenter Roy Castle, who was born in Scholes;[76][77] the York-born Olympic gold medal-winning swimmer, Anita Lonsbrough;[78][79] and the Brighouse born inventor Wilf Lunn, who was raised in Rastrick.[80] Other famous people whose association with Huddersfield is not as notable or well-known, though they were raised there, include H. H. Asquith (born in Morley), who served as the Liberal Prime Minister of the United Kingdom between 1908 and 1916. The actress Lena Headey, who was born in Bermuda, grew up in Shelley from the age of five.[81][82] Harold Wilson, the only Labour Prime Minister to have formed Labour administrations after four general elections, was born at Warneford Road, Milnsbridge, in the western suburbs, on 11 March 1916.  When Wilson was eight, he visited London and a much-reproduced photograph was taken of him standing on the doorstep of 10 Downing Street. Wilson attended Royds Hall Grammar School (now a comprehensive school).[83]  E.A. Hilary Haigh ed. (1992) Huddersfield: A Most Handsome Town \u2013 Aspects of the History and Culture of a West Yorkshire Town. Kirklees MC, Huddersfield, pp.\u00a0704. "},{"title":"Supermajority","content":"  A supermajority (also called supra-majority, supramajority, qualified majority, or special majority) is a requirement for a proposal to gain a specified level of support which is greater than the threshold of more than one-half used for a simple majority. Supermajority rules in a democracy can help to prevent a majority from eroding fundamental rights of a minority, but they can also hamper efforts to respond to problems and encourage corrupt compromises at times when action is taken. Changes to constitutions, especially those with entrenched clauses, commonly require supermajority support in a legislature. Parliamentary procedure requires that any action of a deliberative assembly that may alter the rights of a minority have a supermajority requirement, such as a two-thirds vote. In consensus democracy the supermajority rule is applied in most cases.  Related concepts regarding alternatives to the majority vote requirement include a majority of the entire membership and a majority of the fixed membership. A supermajority can also be specified based on the entire membership or fixed membership rather than on those present and voting.  The first known use of a supermajority rule was in the 100s BC in ancient Rome.[1][how?]  Pope Alexander III introduced the use of supermajority rule for papal elections at the Third Lateran Council in 1179.[2]  In the Democratic Party of the United States, a rule requiring the determination of a presidential nominee required the votes of two-thirds of delegates to the Democratic National Convention was adopted at the party's first presidential nominating convention in 1832.[3] The two-thirds rule gave southern Democrats a de facto veto over any presidential nominee after the Civil War, which lasted until the rule was abolished in 1936.[4]  In the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton and James Madison were critical of supermajority requirements. In Federalist 22, Hamilton wrote that while preventing harmful legislation from being passed, such requirements also prevented beneficial legislation from being passed, and \"its real operation is to embarrass the administration, to destroy the energy of government, and to substitute the pleasure, caprice or artifices of an insignificant, turbulent or corrupt junto, to the regular deliberations and decisions of a respectable majority.\" Hamilton also wrote that such a requirement would encourage \"contemptible compromises of the public good\".[5] In Federalist 58, Madison wrote that supermajority requirements might help impede the passage of \"hasty and partial measures\", but \"[i]n all cases where justice or the general good might require new laws to be passed, or active measures to be pursued, the fundamental principle of free government would be reversed. It would be no longer the majority that would rule; the power would be transferred to the minority.\" Madison also wrote that such requirements would encourage secession.[6]  A majority vote, or more than half the votes cast, is a common voting basis. Instead of the basis of a majority, a supermajority can be specified using any fraction or percentage which is greater than one-half.[7] It can also be called a qualified majority.[8] Common supermajorities include three-fifths (3\/5\u201360%), two-thirds (2\/3\u201366.66...%), and three-quarters (3\/4\u201375%).  A two-thirds vote, when unqualified, means two-thirds or more of the votes cast.[9][10][11] This voting basis is equivalent to the number of votes in favour being at least twice the number of votes against.[12] Abstentions and absences are excluded in calculating a two-thirds vote.[10]  The two-thirds requirement can be qualified to include the entire membership of a body instead of only those present and voting, but such a requirement must be explicitly stated (such as \"two-thirds of those members duly elected and sworn\").[9] In this case, abstentions and absences count as votes against the proposal. Alternatively, the voting requirement could be specified as \"two-thirds of those present\", which has the effect of counting abstentions but not absences as votes against the proposal.[13]  For example, if an organization has 150 members and at a meeting 30 members are present with 25 votes cast, a \"two-thirds vote\" would be 17. (\"Two-thirds of those present\" would be 20, and \"two-thirds of the entire membership\" would be 100.)[14]  Another type of supermajority is three-fifths (60 percent). This requirement could also be qualified to include the entire membership or to include those present.  In 2006, the Constitution of Florida was amended to require a 60% majority to pass new constitutional amendments by popular vote.[15]  In Poland, the Sejm (lower house of the bicameral parliament of Poland) requires a three-fifths majority of MPs to overturn a veto from the President of Poland.[16]  For the Montenegrin independence referendum held in 2006 the European Union envoy Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k proposed independence if a 55% supermajority of votes are cast in favor with a minimum turnout of 50%. Such procedure, ultimately accepted by the government of Montenegro, was somewhat criticized as overriding the traditional practice of requiring a two-thirds supermajority, as practiced in all former Yugoslav countries before (including the previous referendum in Montenegro).  In 2016, the Constitution of Colorado was amended to require a 55% majority to pass new constitutional amendments by popular vote. It had previously been a simple majority.[17]  Related concepts regarding alternatives to the majority vote requirement include a \"majority of the entire membership\" and a \"majority of the fixed membership\".  A majority of the entire membership is a voting basis that requires that more than half of all the members of a body (including those absent and those present but not voting) vote in favor of a proposition in order for it to be passed.[14] In practical terms, it means an absence or an abstention from voting is equivalent to a \"no\" vote.[13] It may be contrasted with a majority vote which only requires more than half of those actually voting to approve a proposition for it to be enacted. An absolute majority may also be the same as a majority of the entire membership, although this usage is not consistent.[8][18]  A supermajority could be specified in this voting basis, such as a vote of \"two-thirds of the entire membership\". By way of illustration, in February 2007 the Italian Government fell after it lost a vote in the Italian Senate by 158 votes to 136 (with 24 abstentions). The government needed an absolute majority in the 318-member house but fell two votes short of the required 160 when two of its own supporters abstained.[19] In the United States Electoral College, an absolute majority of electoral votes are required for it to elect the US president and vice-president.  A majority of the fixed membership is based on the total number of the established fixed membership of the deliberative assembly.[14] It is used only when a specific number of seats or memberships is established in the rules governing the organization. A majority of the fixed membership would be different from a majority of the entire membership if there are vacancies.[14]  For example, say a board has 12 seats. If the board has the maximum number of members, or 12 members, a majority of the entire membership and a majority of the fixed membership would be seven members. However, if there are two vacancies (so that there are only ten members on the board), then a majority of the entire membership would be six members (more than half of ten), but a majority of the fixed membership would still be seven members.[14]  It is possible for organizations that use a majority of the fixed membership to be caught in a stalemate if at least half the membership consists of vacancies, making it impossible to perform any actions until those vacancies are filled.[14] The requirement for a minimum number of members to be present in order to conduct business, called a quorum, may be used to avoid such a possibility.  Similar to the voting basis for the entire membership, a supermajority could be specified for this basis, such as a vote of \"two-thirds of the fixed membership\".  Parliamentary procedure requires that any action that may alter the rights of a minority have a supermajority requirement. Robert's Rules of Order states:[10] As a compromise between the rights of the individual and the rights of the assembly, the principle has been established that a two-thirds vote is required to adopt any motion that: (a) suspends or modifies a rule of order previously adopted; (b) prevents the introduction of a question for consideration; (c) closes, limits, or extends the limits of debate; (d) closes nominations or the polls, or otherwise limits the freedom of nominating or voting; or (e) takes away membership. This book also states:[20] The vote of a majority of the entire membership is frequently an alternative to a requirement of previous notice, and is required in order to rescind and expunge from the minutes (see p. 310). Otherwise, prescribing such a requirement is generally unsatisfactory in an assembly of an ordinary society, since it is likely to be impossible to get a majority of the entire membership even to attend a given meeting, although in certain instances it may be appropriate in conventions or in permanent boards where the members are obligated to attend the meetings. To pass an amendment to the Australian Constitution, a referendum is required and must achieve a \"double majority\": a majority of those voting nationwide, as well as separate majorities in a majority of states (i.e., 4 out of 6 states).[21] Furthermore, in circumstances where a specific state is affected by a referendum, a majority of voters in that state must also agree to the change[22]\u2014referred to as a \"triple majority\".[citation needed]  Article 142 of the Constitution of Bangladesh stipulates a bill in the Jatiya Sangsad must expressly state in its short title its purpose is to amend a provision of the constitution. Constitutional amendments require a two-thirds majority in the unicameral Jatiya Sangsad to become effective.  In Canada, most constitutional amendments can be passed only if identical resolutions are adopted by the House of Commons, the Senate and two-thirds or more of the provincial legislative assemblies representing at least 50 percent of the national population.  Article 20 of the Constitution of Denmark states that if the government or parliament wants to cede parts of national sovereignty to an international body such as the European Union or the United Nations, it has to get a five-sixths majority in the Folketing (150 out of 179 seats).[23] If there is only a simple majority, a referendum must be held on the subject.[23]  The Council of the European Union uses 'Qualified majority voting' for the majority of issues brought before the institution. However, for matters of extreme importance for individual member states, unanimous voting is implemented.[24] An example of this is Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, whereby a member state can have its rights suspended with the unanimous approval of all other member states.  After the accession of Croatia, on 1\u00a0July 2013, at least 260 votes out of a total of 352 by at least 15 member states were required for legislation to be adopted by qualified majority. From 1\u00a0July 2013, the pass condition translated into:  Requirements to reach an absolute majority is a common feature of voting in the European Parliament (EP) where under the ordinary legislative procedure the EP is required to act by an absolute majority if it is to either amend or reject proposed legislation.[25]  According to Finnish Law, when a new legislative proposal would in some way add, alter or remove a part of the Finnish constitution, a bill requires a 2\/3 majority in the Parliament of Finland. In other words, a legislative proposal that would modify, add or remove a part of the Finnish Constitution requires at least the approval of 134 out of 200 representatives in the Parliament of Finland  Article 368 of the Indian Constitution requires a supermajority of two-thirds of members present and voting in each house of the Indian Parliament, subject to at least by a majority of the total membership of each House of Parliament, to amend the constitution. In addition, in matters affecting the states and judiciary, at least above half of all the states need to ratify the amendment.  The President of Italy is elected by an electoral college consisting of both chambers of Parliament sitting in joint session with 58 electors from the country's 20 regions. In the first three rounds of voting, a candidate must get two-thirds of the votes to win, but from the fourth round onwards only an absolute majority is needed. Reforms to the Constitution need to achieve a supermajority of two-thirds of the votes both in the Chamber and in the Senate to avoid the possibility of being sent to popular vote in order to be confirmed through a referendum.  Amendments to the constitution require a two-thirds majority in both houses of the National Diet and a simple majority in a referendum.[26]  Section 268 of the Electoral Act sets out a number of 'reserved provisions'. These provisions include section 17(1) of the Constitution Act 1986 (regarding Parliament's term length), section 35 of the Electoral Act (regarding the drawing of electoral boundaries), and section 74 of the Electoral Act (designating 18 as the minimum voting age). For a 'reserved provision' to be amended or repealed, a three-quarters majority is required in the House of Representatives or a majority is needed in a national referendum.[27]  Under the Constitution of Nigeria a two-thirds majority is required in the National Assembly to alter the Constitution, enact legislation in a few areas, or remove office holders from some positions, such as Speaker. Legislative override or impeachment of the executive at either the state or federal government level also requires a two-thirds majority of the corresponding legislative assembly.[28]  Under the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines, a two-thirds majority of both chambers of the Congress of the Philippines (the House of Representatives and the Senate) meeting in joint session is required to declare war.[29] A two-thirds majority of both chambers is required to override a presidential veto.[29][30] A two-thirds vote of both chambers of Congress voting separately is required to designate the vice president as acting president in the event that a majority of the Cabinet certifies that the president is \"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\" but the president declares that no such inability exists.[29] A two-thirds vote of either chamber is required to suspend or expel a member from that chamber.[29]  Under the 1987 Constitution, \"The Congress may, by a vote of two-thirds of all its Members, call a constitutional convention, or by a majority vote of all its Members, submit to the electorate the question of calling such a convention.\"[29] A three-quarters vote of all the members of the Congress is required to propose an amendment to the Constitution; the proposed amendment is submitted to the people for ratification (by a majority of the votes cast) in a plebiscite.[29]  A two-thirds majority of the Senate is required to ratify treaties, and to remove an impeached official from office.[29] Impeachment by the House, which is the required first step in the removal process, only requires one-third of Representatives to sign a petition (specifically a verified complaint or resolution of impeachment).[29][31][32]  Different amendment procedures apply to different parts of the Constitution. Most of the Articles of the Constitution may be amended by a bill enacted by Parliament if there is at least a supermajority of two-thirds of all elected MPs voting in favour of the bill during its Second and Third Readings in Parliament.[33] This is in contrast to ordinary bills, which only need to be approved by at least a simple majority of all the MPs present and voting.[34]  However, the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) has commanded a majority of more than two-thirds of the seats in Parliament since 1968. Thus, the more stringent amendment requirement has not imposed any major limitation on Parliament's ability to amend the Constitution.[35][failed verification]  A three-fifths majority of legislators is required for a bill to be put to a vote in the National Assembly in order to prevent the ruling party from passing laws without the support of opposition parties.[36] However, if a bill does not achieve the required three-fifths majority at one session without also being rejected, it must then be voted on at the next session even if less than three-fifths of legislators agree to do so.[37]  Additionally, if the President vetoes a bill, the veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority of legislators.[38]  According to Article 65 of the Constitution of South Korea, impeachment of the President requires a two-third majority of legislators to be effective.[38]  According to Article 113 of the Constitution of South Korea, the Constitutional Court requires a two-thirds majority of its judges to issue rulings nullifying laws, removing impeached officials or dissolving a political party.[38]  According to Article 130 of the Constitution of South Korea, amendments to the constitution must be passed by a two-thirds majority of legislators and then approved by voters at a referendum in order to become effective.[38]  The 1978 Constitution states that a three-fifths majority in both Congress of Deputies and Senate of Spain is needed to pass a constitutional reform, but if a two-thirds majority is reached in the Congress of Deputies, an absolute majority of senators is enough to pass the proposal.[39]  Nevertheless, when a new Constitution is proposed or the proposal's goal is to reform the Preliminary Title, the Chapter on Fundamental Rights and Freedoms or the Title on the Crown, the supermajority becomes significantly harder:  The first way has been used twice (1992 and 2011), but the second has never been used.  The Spanish Constitution states other supermajorities:  Each Spanish autonomous community has its own Statute of Autonomy, working like a local constitution that is subject to the 1978 Constitution and national powers.  The Statute of Autonomy of the Canary Islands states that its economic and fiscal regime and electoral law need a two-thirds majority of the Parliament to be modified.[43] On its behalf, the Ombudsman needs a three-fifths majority to be appointed. Also, if a two-thirds majority votes against a law project, it must be proposed to the following session.  Before the Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China in 2005, the constitution amendments need to be passed by the National Assembly. Since the Additional Articles ratified on June 7, 2005, the National Assembly was abolished. Amendments of the constitution need to be proposed by more than one-quarter of members of the Legislative Yuan, passed by three-quarters of those present in the meeting, the presence of which must surpass three-quarters of all members of Legislative Yuan, then followed by approval by more than half (50%) of all eligible voters in referendums.  In Turkey, constitutional amendments need a three fifths majority (360 votes) to be put forward to a referendum and a two-thirds majority (400 votes) to be ratified directly.  According to Article 155 of the Constitution of Ukraine, amendments to the constitution, except for Chapter I \u2014 \"General Principles,\" Chapter III \u2014 \"Elections. Referendum\", and Chapter XIII \u2014 \"Introducing Amendments to the Constitution of Ukraine\", must be previously approved by a simple majority of the constitutional composition of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine and then passed by a two-thirds majority of the constitutional composition of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine at the succeeding regular session of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine.  According to Article 156 of the Constitution of Ukraine, amendments to Chapter I \u2014 \"General Principles,\" Chapter III \u2014 \"Elections. Referendum\", and Chapter XIII \u2014 \"Introducing Amendments to the Constitution of Ukraine\" must be passed by a two-thirds majority of the constitutional composition of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine and then approved by voters at a referendum in order to become effective.  Prior to its repeal, the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 provided that the United Kingdom House of Commons could be dissolved and an election held before the expiry of its 5-year term by a vote of two-thirds of the membership of the House of Commons. The Act's provision for an early dissolution vote was the only supermajority required in the British Constitution. The Act also provided that Parliament could alternatively be dissolved if the House of Commons passed a motion of no-confidence in the government and no new government were to win a motion of confidence within two weeks of the original vote of no-confidence.  The two-thirds supermajority provision for an early dissolution and election was triggered only once, resulting in the 2017 United Kingdom General Election. The previous election in 2015 had occurred due to the natural expiry of the 5-year term of the House of Commons.  Parliamentary supremacy meant that theoretically the Act could be circumvented by a government with a majority that wanted to bypass the requirement for a two-thirds vote by passing an act that stated, \"Notwithstanding the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, a general election will be called on DATE\". This was precisely what was done to initiate the election in 2019, the final election held whilst the Fixed-term Parliaments Act was in effect.  During the 2019 election, both the governing Conservative Party and the opposition Labour Party expressed a desire to repeal the Fixed-term Parliaments Act and restore the traditional, centuries-old system under which elections could be held at any time, subject to the 5-year maximum term limit established by the Parliament Act 1911. Such a repeal would only require a simple majority.  Ultimately, the Fixed-term Parliaments Act was repealed by the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022, thereby removing any supermajority requirement and restoring the previous royal prerogative power to dissolve the House of Commons at any time during its 5-year term.  Section 31A of the Scotland Act 1998[44] and Section 111A of the Government of Wales Act 2006[45] provide that certain provisions of those Acts relating to the functions of and elections to the respective Scottish and Welsh devolved legislatures are protected from amendment by those legislatures, unless a two-thirds supermajority of the total number of members votes in favour.  Regarding Scotland, the protected provisions are:[46]  The protected provisions regarding Wales are the same as those in Scotland; in addition, there are two Wales-specific provisions:[45]  The United Nations Security Council requires a supermajority of the fixed membership on substantive matters (procedural matters require a simple majority of those present and voting). According to Article 27 of the United Nations Charter, at least nine of the Security Council's 15 members (i.e., a three-fifths supermajority) must vote in favor of a draft resolution in order to achieve passage. Specifying the fixed membership has the effect of making abstentions count as votes against\u2014absences are not normal but would be treated the same way.  This is useful for the five permanent members of the council (China, France, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, and the United States) because a vote against from any one of them constitutes a veto, which cannot be overridden. Permanent members who do not support a measure but are unwilling to be seen to block it against the wishes of the majority of the council, tend to abstain; abstentions by veto powers are generally seen by close observers of the UN[according to whom?] as the equivalent of not vetoing votes against and have the same impact on the decision of the Security Council.  The Constitution of the United States requires supermajorities in order for certain significant actions to occur.[47]  Amendments to the Constitution may be proposed in one of two ways: a two-thirds supermajority votes of each body of United States Congress or a convention called by Congress on application of two-thirds (currently 34) of the states. Once proposed, the amendment must be ratified by three-quarters (currently 38) of the states (either through the state legislatures, or ratification conventions, whichever \"mode of ratification\" Congress selects).  Congress may pass bills by simple majority votes. If the president vetoes a bill, Congress may override the veto by a two-thirds supermajority of both houses.  A treaty must be ratified by a two-thirds supermajority of the Senate to enter into force and effect.  Section 4 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution gives Congress a role to play in the event of a presidential disability. If the vice president and a majority of the president's cabinet declare that the president is unable to serve in that role, the vice president becomes acting president. Within 21 days of such a declaration (or, if Congress is in recess when a president is disabled, 21 days after Congress reconvenes), Congress must vote by two-thirds supermajorities to continue the disability declaration; otherwise, such declaration expires after the 21 days and the president would at that time \"resume\" discharging all the powers and duties of the office. As of 2021, Section 4 has never been invoked.  The House may, by a simple majority vote, impeach a federal official (such as, but not limited to, the president, vice president, or a federal judge). Removal from office requires a two-thirds supermajority of the Senate. In 1842, the House failed to impeach president John Tyler. In 1868, the Senate fell one vote short of removing president Andrew Johnson following his impeachment. In 1999, efforts to remove Bill Clinton following his impeachment in 1998 fell just short of a simple majority, and 17 votes short of the two-thirds supermajority. The impeachment procedure was last used in 2021, when former president Donald Trump was impeached for a second time and subsequently acquitted. Each chamber may expel one of its own members by a two-thirds supermajority vote; this last happened when the House expelled George Santos in 2023.  The 14th Amendment (section 3) bars a person from federal or state office if, after having previously taken an oath to support the Constitution as a federal or state officer, \"shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof\". However, both the House and Senate may jointly override this restriction with a two-thirds supermajority vote each.  A two-thirds supermajority in the Senate is 67 out of 100 senators, while a two-thirds supermajority in the House is 290 out of 435 representatives. However, since many votes take place without every seat in the House filled and representative participating, it does not often require 67 senators or 290 representatives to achieve this supermajority.  Apart from these constitutional requirements, a Senate rule (except in cases covered by the nuclear option, or of a rule change) requires an absolute supermajority of three-fifths to move to a vote through a cloture motion, which closes debate on a bill or nomination, thus ending a filibuster by a minority of members. In current practice, the mere threat of a filibuster prevents passing almost any measure that has less than three-fifths agreement in the Senate, 60 of the 100 senators if every seat is filled.  For state legislatures in the United States, Mason's Manual says, \"A deliberative body cannot by its own act or rule require a two-thirds vote to take any action where the constitution or controlling authority requires only a majority vote. To require a two-thirds vote, for example, to take any action would be to give to any number more than one-third of the members the power to defeat the action and amount to a delegation of the powers of the body to a minority.\"[48] Some states require a supermajority for passage of a constitutional amendment or statutory initiative.[49]  Many state constitutions allow or require amendments to their own constitutions to be proposed by supermajorities of the state legislature; these amendments must usually be approved by the voters at one or more subsequent elections. Michigan, for instance, allows the Legislature to propose an amendment to the Michigan Constitution; it must then be ratified by the voters at the next general election (unless a special election is called).[50]  In most states, the state legislature may override a governor's veto of legislation. In most states, a two-thirds supermajority of both chambers is required.[51] However, in some states (e.g., Illinois, Maryland and North Carolina), only a three-fifths supermajority is required,[52][53][54] while in Kentucky and West Virginia only a normal majority is needed.  One common provision of so-called \"taxpayer bill of rights\" laws (either in state statutes or state constitutions) is requirement of a supermajority vote in the state legislature to increase taxes. The National Conference of State Legislatures reported in 2010 that fifteen states required a supermajority vote (either a three-fifths, two-thirds or three-quarters majority vote in both chambers) to pass some or all tax increases.[55]  Supermajority requirements for tax increases have been criticized as \"deeply flawed\" by a report by the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities because such requirements empower a minority of legislators, making it difficult to close tax loopholes or fund transportation infrastructure, and also may encourage pork-barrel spending as a trade-off to ensure passage of a tax increase (see logrolling).[56]  The Rome Statute requires a seven-eighths majority of participating states to be amended. "},{"title":"Association football","content":"  Association football, commonly known as football, or soccer,[a] is a team sport played between two teams of 11 players each, who primarily use their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field called a pitch. The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into a rectangular-framed goal defended by the opposing team. Traditionally, the game has been played over two 45-minute halves, for a total match time of 90 minutes. With an estimated 250 million players active in over 200 countries and territories, it is the world's most popular sport.  The game of association football is played in accordance with the Laws of the Game, a set of rules that has been in effect since 1863 and maintained by the IFAB since 1886. The game is played with a football that is 68\u201370\u00a0cm (27\u201328\u00a0in) in circumference. The two teams compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts, under the bar, and across the goal line), thereby scoring a goal. When the ball is in play, the players mainly use their feet, but may use any other part of their body, except for their hands or arms, to control, strike, or pass the ball. Only the goalkeepers may use their hands and arms, and only then within the penalty area. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner. There are situations where a goal can be disallowed, such as an offside call or a foul in the build-up to the goal. Depending on the format of the competition, an equal number of goals scored may result in a draw being declared, or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shoot-out.[5]  Internationally, association football is governed by FIFA. Under FIFA, there are six continental confederations: AFC, CAF, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL, OFC, and UEFA. Of these confederations, CONMEBOL is the oldest one, being founded in 1916. National associations (e.g. The FA or JFA) are responsible for managing the game in their own countries both professionally and at an amateur level, and coordinating competitions in accordance with the Laws of the Game. The most senior and prestigious international competitions are the FIFA World Cup and the FIFA Women's World Cup. The men's World Cup is the most-viewed sporting event in the world, surpassing the Olympic Games.[6] The two most prestigious competitions in European club football are the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Women's Champions League, which attract an extensive television audience throughout the world. Since 2009, the final of the men's tournament has been the most-watched annual sporting event in the world.[7]    Association football is one of a family of football codes that emerged from various ball games played worldwide since antiquity. Within the English-speaking world, the sport is now usually called \"football\" in Great Britain and most of Ulster in the north of Ireland, whereas people usually call it \"soccer\" in regions and countries where other codes of football are prevalent, such as Australia,[8] Canada, South Africa, most of Ireland (excluding Ulster),[9] and the United States. A notable exception is New Zealand, where in the first two decades of the 21st century, under the influence of international television, \"football\" has been gaining prevalence, despite the dominance of other codes of football, namely rugby union and rugby league.[10]  The term soccer comes from Oxford \"-er\" slang, which was prevalent at the University of Oxford in England from about 1875, and is thought to have been borrowed from the slang of Rugby School. Initially spelt assoccer (a shortening of \"association\"), it was later reduced to the modern spelling.[11][12] This form of slang also gave rise to rugger for rugby football, fiver and tenner for five pound and ten pound notes, and the now-archaic footer that was also a name for association football.[13] The word soccer arrived at its current form in 1895 and was first recorded in 1889 in the earlier form of socca.[14]  Kicking ball games arose independently multiple times across multiple cultures.[b] The Chinese competitive game cuju (\u8e74\u97a0, literally \"kick ball\"; also known as tsu chu) resembles modern association football.[16] This is the earliest form of the game for which there is scientific evidence, a military manual from the Han dynasty.[17] Cuju players could use any part of the body apart from hands and the intent was to kick a ball through an opening into a net. During the Han dynasty (206 BCE \u2013 220 CE), cuju games were standardised and rules were established.[18] The Silk Road facilitated the transmission of cuju, especially the game popular in the Tang dynasty, the period when the inflatable ball was invented and replaced the stuffed ball.[19] Other East Asian games included kemari in Japan and chuk-guk in Korea, both influenced by cuju.[20][21] Kemari originated after the year 600 during the Asuka period. It was a ceremonial rather than a competitive game, and involved the kicking of a mari, a ball made of animal skin.[22] In North America, pasuckuakohowog was a ball game played by the Algonquians; it was described as \"almost identical to the kind of folk football being played in Europe at the same time, in which the ball was kicked through goals\".[23]  Phaininda and episkyros were Greek ball games.[17][24] An image of an episkyros player depicted in low relief on a stele of c.\u2009375\u2013400 BCE in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens[15] appears on the UEFA European Championship trophy.[25] Athenaeus, writing in 228 CE, mentions the Roman ball game harpastum. Phaininda, episkyros and harpastum were played involving hands and violence. They all appear to have resembled rugby football, wrestling, and volleyball more than what is recognisable as modern football.[18][26][27][28][29][30] As with pre-codified mob football, the antecedent of all modern football codes, these three games involved more handling the ball than kicking it.[31][32]  Association football in itself does not have a classical history.[25] Notwithstanding any similarities to other ball games played around the world, FIFA has described that no historical connection exists with any game played in antiquity outside Europe.[33] The history of football in England dates back to at least the eighth century.[34] The modern rules of association football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely varying forms of football played in the public schools of England.  The Cambridge rules, first drawn up at the University of Cambridge in 1848, were particularly influential in the development of subsequent codes, including association football. The Cambridge rules were written at Trinity College, Cambridge, at a meeting attended by representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester and Shrewsbury schools. They were not universally adopted. During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the Sheffield Football Club, formed by former public school pupils in 1857,[35] which led to the formation of a Sheffield FA in 1867. In 1862, John Charles Thring of Uppingham School also devised an influential set of rules.[36]  These ongoing efforts contributed to the formation of The Football Association (The FA) in 1863, which first met on the morning of 26 October 1863 at the Freemasons' Tavern in Great Queen Street, London.[37] The only school to be represented on this occasion was Charterhouse. The Freemasons' Tavern was the setting for five more meetings of The FA between October and December 1863; the English FA eventually issued the first comprehensive set of rules named Laws of the Game, forming modern football.[38] The laws included bans on running with the ball in hand and hacking (kicking an opponent in the shins), tripping and holding.[39] Eleven clubs, under the charge of FA secretary Ebenezer Cobb Morley, ratified the original thirteen laws of the game.[37] The sticking point was hacking, which a twelfth club at the meeting, Blackheath FC, had wanted to keep, resulting in them withdrawing from the FA.[37] Other English rugby clubs followed this lead and did not join the FA, and instead in 1871, along with Blackheath, formed the Rugby Football Union. The FA rules included handling of the ball by \"marks\" and the lack of a crossbar, rules which made it remarkably similar to Victorian rules football being developed at that time in Australia. The Sheffield FA played by its own rules until the 1870s, with the FA absorbing some of its rules until there was little difference between the games.[40]  The world's oldest football competition is the FA Cup, which was founded by the footballer and cricketer Charles W. Alcock, and has been contested by English teams since 1872. The first official international football match also took place in 1872, between Scotland and England in Glasgow, again at the instigation of Alcock. England is also home to the world's first football league, which was founded in Birmingham in 1888 by Aston Villa director William McGregor.[41] The original format contained 12 clubs from the Midlands and Northern England.[42]  Laws of the Game are determined by the International Football Association Board (IFAB).[43] The board was formed in 1886[44] after a meeting in Manchester of the Football Association, the Scottish Football Association, the Football Association of Wales, and the Irish Football Association. FIFA, the international football body, was formed in Paris in 1904 and declared that they would adhere to the Laws of the Game of the Football Association.[45] The growing popularity of the international game led to the admittance of FIFA representatives to the IFAB in 1913. The board consists of four representatives from FIFA and one representative from each of the four British associations.[46]  For most of the 20th century, Europe and South America were the dominant regions in association football. The FIFA World Cup, inaugurated in 1930, became the main stage for players of both continents to show their worth and the strength of their national teams.[47] In the second half of the century, the European Cup and the Copa Libertadores were created, and the champions of these two club competitions would contest the Intercontinental Cup to prove which team was the best in the world.[48]  In the 21st century, South America has continued to produce some of the best footballers in the world,[49] but its clubs have fallen behind the still dominant European clubs, which often sign the best players from Latin America and elsewhere.[47][49] Meanwhile, football has improved in Africa, Asia and North America,[49] and nowadays, these regions are at least on equal grounds with South America in club football,[50] although countries in the Caribbean and Oceania regions (except Australia) have yet to make a mark in international football.[51][52] When it comes to men's national teams, Europeans and South Americans continue to dominate the FIFA World Cup, as no team from any other region has managed to even reach the final.[47][49] These regional trends do not hold true for the women's game, as the United States women's national team has won the FIFA Women's World Cup four times, more than any other women's team. [53]  Football is played at a professional level all over the world. Millions of people regularly go to football stadiums to follow their favourite teams,[54] while billions more watch the game on television or on the internet.[55][56] A very large number of people also play football at an amateur level. According to a survey conducted by FIFA published in 2001, over 240 million people from more than 200 countries regularly play football.[57] Football has the highest global television audience in sport.[58]  In many parts of the world, football evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual fans, local communities, and even nations. Ryszard Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski says that Europeans who are polite, modest, or humble fall easily into rage when playing or watching football games.[59] The Ivory Coast national football team helped secure a truce to the nation's civil war in 2006[60] and it helped further reduce tensions between government and rebel forces in 2007 by playing a match in the rebel capital of Bouak\u00e9, an occasion that brought both armies together peacefully for the first time.[61] By contrast, football is widely considered to have been the final proximate cause for the Football War in June 1969 between El Salvador and Honduras.[62] The sport also exacerbated tensions at the beginning of the Croatian War of Independence of the 1990s, when a match between Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade degenerated into rioting in May 1990.[63]  Women's association football has historically seen opposition, with national associations severely curbing its development and several outlawing it completely. Women may have been playing football for as long as the game has existed. Evidence shows that a similar ancient game (cuju, or tsu chu) was played by women during the Han dynasty (25\u2013220 CE), as female figures are depicted in frescoes of the period playing tsu chu.[64][65] There are also reports of annual football matches played by women in Midlothian, Scotland, during the 1790s.[66][67]  Association football, the modern game, has documented early involvement of women.[67] In 1863, football governing bodies introduced standardised rules to prohibit violence on the pitch, making it more socially acceptable for women to play.[68] The first match recorded by the Scottish Football Association took place in 1892 in Glasgow.[66] In England, the first recorded game of football between women took place in 1895.[68] Women's football has traditionally been associated with charity games and physical exercise, particularly in the United Kingdom.[69]  Association football continued to be played by women since the time of the first recorded women's games in the late 19th century.[69][70] The best-documented early European team was founded by activist Nettie Honeyball in England in 1894. It was named the British Ladies' Football Club. Honeyball is quoted as, \"I founded the association late last year [1894], with the fixed resolve of proving to the world that women are not the 'ornamental and useless' creatures men have pictured. I must confess, my convictions on all matters where the sexes are so widely divided are all on the side of emancipation, and I look forward to the time when ladies may sit in Parliament and have a voice in the direction of affairs, especially those which concern them most.\"[71] Honeyball and those like her paved the way for women's football. However, the women's game was frowned upon by the British football associations and continued without their support. It has been suggested that this was motivated by a perceived threat to the \"masculinity\" of the game.[72]  Women's football became popular on a large scale at the time of the First World War, when female employment in heavy industry spurred the growth of the game, much as it had done for men 50 years earlier. The most successful team of the era was Dick, Kerr Ladies F.C. of Preston, England. The team played in one of the first women's international matches against a French XI team in 1920,[73][74] and also made up most of the England team against a Scottish Ladies XI in the same year, winning 22\u20130.[66]  Despite being more popular than some men's football events, with one match seeing a 53,000 strong crowd in 1920,[75][76] women's football in England suffered a blow in 1921 when The Football Association outlawed the playing of the game on association members' pitches,[77] stating that \"the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and should not be encouraged.\"[78] Players and football writers have argued that this ban was, in fact, due to envy of the large crowds that women's matches attracted,[76] and because the FA had no control over the money made from the women's game.[78] The FA ban led to the formation of the short-lived English Ladies Football Association and play moved to rugby grounds.[79] Women's football also faced bans in several other countries, notably in Brazil from 1941 to 1979,[80] in France from 1941 to 1970,[81] and in Germany from 1955 to 1970.[82]  Restrictions began to be reduced in the 1960s and 1970s. The Italian women's football league was established in 1968.[83] In December 1969, the Women's Football Association was formed in England,[69][84] with the sport eventually becoming the most prominent team sport for women in the United Kingdom.[69] Two unofficial women's World Cups were organised by the FIEFF in 1970 and in 1971.  Also in 1971, Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) members voted to officially recognise women's football,[69] while The Football Association rescinded the ban that prohibited women from playing on association members' pitches in England.[84]  Women's football still faces many struggles, but its worldwide growth[85] has seen major competitions being launched at both the national and international levels, mirroring the men's competitions. The FIFA Women's World Cup was inaugurated in 1991: the first tournament was held in China, featuring 12 teams from the respective six confederations.  The World Cup has been held every four years since;[86] by the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup in France, it had expanded to 24 national teams, and 1.12 billion viewers watched the competition.[87] Women's football has been an Olympic event since 1996.[88]  North America is the dominant region in women's football, with the United States winning most FIFA Women's World Cups and Olympic tournaments. Europe and Asia come second and third in terms of international success,[89][90] and the women's game has been improving in South America.[91]  Association football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game. The game is played using a spherical ball of 68\u201370\u00a0cm (27\u201328\u00a0in) circumference,[92] known as the football (or soccer ball). Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw. Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game: to represent their team in the coin toss before kick-off or penalty kicks.[5]  The primary law is that players other than goalkeepers may not deliberately handle the ball with their hands or arms during play, though they must use both their hands during a throw-in restart. Although players usually use their feet to move the ball around, they may use any part of their body (notably, \"heading\" with the forehead)[93] other than their hands or arms.[94] Within normal play, all players are free to play the ball in any direction and move throughout the pitch, though players may not pass to teammates who are in an offside position.[95]  During gameplay, players attempt to create goal-scoring opportunities through individual control of the ball, such as by dribbling, passing the ball to a teammate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted. Football is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the referee for an infringement of the rules. After a stoppage, play recommences with a specified restart.[96]  At a professional level, most matches produce only a few goals. For example, the 2022\u201323 season of the English Premier League produced an average of 2.85 goals per match.[97] The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper,[98] but a number of specialised roles have evolved.[99] Broadly, these include three main categories: strikers, or forwards, whose main task is to score goals; defenders, who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and midfielders, who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards on their team. Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to distinguish them from the goalkeeper.  These positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends the most time. For example, there are central defenders and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination. The number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse creates a slower, more defensive style of play. While players typically spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time.[100] The layout of a team's players is known as a formation. Defining the team's formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the team's manager.[101]  There are 17 laws in the official Laws of the Game, each containing a collection of stipulations and guidelines. The same laws are designed to apply to all levels of football for both sexes, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, seniors and people with physical disabilities are permitted.[c] The laws are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game. The Laws of the Game are published by FIFA, but are maintained by the IFAB.[102] In addition to the seventeen laws, numerous IFAB decisions and other directives contribute to the regulation of association football.[103][104] Within the United States, Major League Soccer used a distinct ruleset during the 1990s[105] and the National Federation of State High School Associations and National Collegiate Athletic Association still use rulesets that are comparable to, but different from, the IFAB Laws.  Each team consists of a maximum of eleven players (excluding substitutes), one of whom must be the goalkeeper. Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team, which is usually seven. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, provided they do so within the penalty area in front of their own goal. Though there are a variety of positions in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the Laws.[98]  The basic equipment or kit players are required to wear includes a shirt, shorts, socks, footwear and adequate shin guards. An athletic supporter and protective cup is highly recommended for male players by medical experts and professionals.[106][107] Headgear is not a required piece of basic equipment, but players today may choose to wear it to protect themselves from head injury.[108] Players are forbidden to wear or use anything that is dangerous to themselves or another player, such as jewellery or watches. The goalkeeper must wear clothing that is easily distinguishable from that worn by the other players and the match officials.[109]  A number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game. The maximum number of substitutions permitted in most competitive international and domestic league games is five in 90 minutes,[110] with each team being allowed one more if the game should go into extra-time; the permitted number may vary in other competitions or in friendly matches. Common reasons for a substitution include injury, tiredness, ineffectiveness, a tactical switch, or timewasting at the end of a finely poised game. In standard adult matches, a player who has been substituted may not take further part in a match.[111] IFAB recommends \"that a match should not continue if there are fewer than seven players in either team\". Any decision regarding points awarded for abandoned games is left to the individual football associations.[112]   A game is officiated by a referee, who has \"full authority to enforce the Laws of the Game in connection with the match to which he has been appointed\" (Law 5), and whose decisions are final. The referee is assisted by two assistant referees. In many high-level games there is also a fourth official who assists the referee and may replace another official should the need arise.[113]  Goal line technology is used to measure if the whole ball has crossed the goal-line thereby determining whether a goal has been scored or not; this was brought in to prevent controversy. Video assistant referees (VAR) have also been increasingly introduced in high-level matches to assist officials through video replays to correct clear and obvious mistakes. There are four types of calls that can be reviewed: mistaken identity in awarding a red or yellow card, goals and whether there was a violation during the buildup, direct red card decisions, and penalty decisions.[114]  The ball is spherical with a circumference of between 68 and 70\u00a0cm (27 and 28\u00a0in), a weight in the range of 410 to 450\u00a0g (14 to 16\u00a0oz), and a pressure between 0.6 and 1.1 standard atmospheres (8.5 and 15.6 pounds per square inch) at sea level. In the past the ball was made up of leather panels sewn together, with a latex bladder for pressurisation, but modern balls at all levels of the game are now synthetic.[115][116]  As the Laws were formulated in England, and were initially administered solely by the four British football associations within IFAB, the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in imperial units. The Laws now express dimensions with approximate metric equivalents (followed by traditional units in brackets), though use of imperial units remains popular in English-speaking countries with a relatively recent history of metrication (or only partial metrication), such as Britain.[117]  The length of the pitch, or field, for international adult matches is in the range of 100\u2013110\u00a0m (110\u2013120\u00a0yd) and the width is in the range of 64\u201375\u00a0m (70\u201380\u00a0yd). Fields for non-international matches may be 90\u2013120\u00a0m (100\u2013130\u00a0yd) in length and 45\u201390\u00a0m (50\u2013100\u00a0yd) in width, provided the pitch does not become square. In 2008, the IFAB initially approved a fixed size of 105\u00a0m (115\u00a0yd) long and 68\u00a0m (74\u00a0yd) wide as a standard pitch dimension for international matches;[118] however, this decision was later put on hold and was never actually implemented.[119]  The longer boundary lines are touchlines, while the shorter boundaries (on which the goals are placed) are goal lines. A rectangular goal is positioned on each goal line, midway between the two touchlines.[120] The inner edges of the vertical goal posts must be 7.32\u00a0m (24\u00a0ft) apart, and the lower edge of the horizontal crossbar supported by the goal posts must be 2.44\u00a0m (8\u00a0ft) above the ground. Nets are usually placed behind the goal, but are not required by the Laws.[121]  In front of the goal is the penalty area. This area is marked by the goal line, two lines starting on the goal line 16.5\u00a0m (18\u00a0yd) from the goalposts and extending 16.5\u00a0m (18\u00a0yd) into the pitch perpendicular to the goal line, and a line joining them. This area has a number of functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul by a member of the defending team becomes punishable by a penalty kick. Other markings define the position of the ball or players at kick-offs, goal kicks, penalty kicks and corner kicks.[122]  A standard adult football match consists of two halves of 45 minutes each. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time.[123] The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called \"additional time\" in FIFA documents,[124][125] but is most commonly referred to as stoppage time or injury time, while lost time can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. Stoppage time does not fully compensate for the time in which the ball is out of play, and a 90-minute game typically involves about an hour of \"effective playing time\".[126][127] The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, towards the end of the half, the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time they intend to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee.[123] Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in 1891 during a match between Stoke and Aston Villa. Trailing 1\u20130 with two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty kick. Villa's goalkeeper deliberately kicked the ball out of play; by the time it was recovered, the clock had run out and the game was over, leaving Stoke unable to attempt the penalty.[128] The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until a penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed; thus, no game can end with an uncompleted penalty.[129]  In league competitions, games may end in a draw. In knockout competitions where a winner is required, various methods may be employed to break such a deadlock; some competitions may invoke replays.[130] A game tied at the end of regulation time may go into extra time, which consists of two further 15-minute periods. If the score is still tied after extra time, some competitions allow the use of penalty shoot-outs (known officially in the Laws of the Game as \"kicks from the penalty mark\") to determine which team will progress to the next stage of the tournament or be the champion. Goals scored during extra time periods count towards the final score of the game, but kicks from the penalty mark are only used to decide the team that progresses to the next part of the tournament, with goals scored in a penalty shoot-out not making up part of the final score.[5]  In competitions using two-legged matches, each team competes at home once, with an aggregate score from the two matches deciding which team progresses. Where aggregates are equal, the away goals rule may be used to determine the winners, in which case the winner is the team that scored the most goals in the leg they played away from home. If the result is still equal, extra time and potentially a penalty shoot-out are required.[5]  Under the Laws, the two basic states of play during a game are ball in play and ball out of play. From the beginning of each playing period with a kick-off until the end of the playing period, the ball is in play at all times, except when either the ball leaves the field of play, or play is stopped by the referee. When the ball becomes out of play, play is restarted by one of eight restart methods depending on how it went out of play:  A foul occurs when a player commits an offence listed in the Laws of the Game while the ball is in play. The offences that constitute a foul are listed in Law 12. Handling the ball deliberately, tripping an opponent, or pushing an opponent, are examples of \"penal fouls\", punishable by a direct free kick or penalty kick depending on where the offence occurred. Other fouls are punishable by an indirect free kick.[94]  The referee may punish a player's or substitute's misconduct by a caution (yellow card) or dismissal (red card). A second yellow card in the same game leads to a red card, which results in a dismissal. A player given a yellow card is said to have been \"booked\", the referee writing the player's name in their official notebook. If a player has been dismissed, no substitute can be brought on in their place and the player may not participate in further play. Misconduct may occur at any time, and while the offences that constitute misconduct are listed, the definitions are broad. In particular, the offence of \"unsporting behaviour\" may be used to deal with most events that violate the spirit of the game, even if they are not listed as specific offences. A referee can show a yellow or red card to a player, substitute, substituted player, and to non-players such as managers and support staff.[94][136]  Rather than stopping play, the referee may allow play to continue if doing so will benefit the team against which an offence has been committed. This is known as \"playing an advantage\".[137] The referee may \"call back\" play and penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue within \"a few seconds\". Even if an offence is not penalised due to advantage being played, the offender may still be sanctioned for misconduct at the next stoppage of play.[138]  The referee's decision in all on-pitch matters is considered final.[139] The score of a match cannot be altered after the game, even if later evidence shows that decisions (including awards\/non-awards of goals) were incorrect.  Along with the general administration of the sport, football associations and competition organisers also enforce good conduct in wider aspects of the game, dealing with issues such as comments to the press, clubs' financial management, doping, age fraud and match fixing. Most competitions enforce mandatory suspensions for players who are sent off in a game.[140] Some on-field incidents, if considered very serious (such as allegations of racial abuse), may result in competitions deciding to impose heavier sanctions than those normally associated with a red card.[d] Some associations allow for appeals against player suspensions incurred on-field if clubs feel a referee was incorrect or unduly harsh.[140]  Sanctions for such infractions may be levied on individuals or on clubs as a whole. Penalties may include fines, point deductions (in league competitions) or even expulsion from competitions. For example, the English Football League deduct 12 points from any team that enters financial administration.[141] Among other administrative sanctions are penalties against game forfeiture. Teams that had forfeited a game or had been forfeited against would be awarded a technical loss or win.  The recognised international governing body of football (and associated games, such as futsal and beach soccer)[c] is FIFA. The FIFA headquarters are located in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland. Six regional confederations are associated with FIFA; these are:[142]  National associations (or national federations) oversee football within individual countries. These are generally synonymous with sovereign states (for example, the Cameroonian Football Federation in Cameroon), but also include a smaller number of associations responsible for sub-national entities or autonomous regions (for example, the Scottish Football Association in Scotland). 211 national associations are affiliated both with FIFA and with their respective continental confederations.[142] Other national associations may be members of continental confederations but otherwise not participate in FIFA competitions.[143]  While FIFA is responsible for arranging competitions and most rules related to international competition, the actual Laws of the Game are set by the IFAB, where each of the UK Associations has one vote, while FIFA collectively has four votes.[46]    International competitions in association football principally consist of two varieties: competitions involving representative national teams or those involving clubs based in multiple nations and national leagues. International football, without qualification, most often refers to the former. In the case of international club competition, it is the country of origin of the clubs involved, not the nationalities of their players, that renders the competition international in nature.  The major international competition in football is the World Cup, organised by FIFA. This competition has taken place every four years since 1930, with the exception of the 1942 and 1946 tournaments, which were cancelled because of World War II. As of 2022, over 200 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within the scope of continental confederations for a place in the finals.[144] The finals tournament, held every four years, involved 32 national teams (expanding to 48 teams for the 2026 tournament) competing over a four-week period.[145][e] The World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament as well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world, exceeding even the Olympic Games; the cumulative audience of all matches of the 2006 FIFA World Cup was estimated to be 26.29 billion with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the final match, one-ninth of the entire population of the planet.[146][147][148][149] The 1958 World Cup saw the emergence of Pel\u00e9 as a global sporting star, a period that coincided with \"the explosive spread of television, which massively amplified his presence everywhere\".[150] The current champions are Argentina, who won their third title at the 2022 tournament in Qatar.[151] The FIFA Women's World Cup has been held every four years since 1991. Under the tournament's current format that was expanded in 2023, national teams vie for 31 slots in a three-year qualification phase, while the host nation's team enters automatically as the 32nd slot.[152] The current champions are Spain, after winning their first title in the 2023 tournament.[153]  There has been a football tournament at every Summer Olympic Games since 1900, except at the 1932 games in Los Angeles when FIFA and the IOC had disagreed over the status of amateur players.[154][155] Before the inception of the World Cup, the Olympics (especially during the 1920s) were the most prestigious international event. Originally, the tournament was for amateurs only.[45] As professionalism spread around the world, the gap in quality between the World Cup and the Olympics widened. The countries that benefited most were the Soviet Bloc countries of Eastern Europe, where top athletes were state-sponsored while retaining their status as amateurs. Between 1948 and 1980, 23 out of 27 Olympic medals were won by Eastern Europe, with only Sweden (gold in 1948 and bronze in 1952), Denmark (bronze in 1948 and silver in 1960) and Japan (bronze in 1968) breaking their dominance. For the 1984 Los Angeles Games, the IOC allowed professional players to compete. Since 1992, male competitors must be under 23 years old, although since 1996, three players over the age of 23 have been allowed per squad.[156] A women's tournament was added in 1996; in contrast to the men's event, full international sides without age restrictions play the women's Olympic tournament.[157]  After the World Cup, the most important international football competitions are the continental championships, which are organised by each continental confederation and contested between national teams. These are the European Championship (UEFA), the Copa Am\u00e9rica (CONMEBOL), the African Cup of Nations (CAF), the Asian Cup (AFC), the CONCACAF Gold Cup (CONCACAF) and the OFC Men's Nations Cup (OFC).[158] These competitions are not strictly limited to members of the continental confederations, with guest teams from other continents sometimes invited to compete.[159] The FIFA Confederations Cup was contested by the winners of all six continental championships, the current FIFA World Cup champions, and the country which was hosting the next World Cup. This was generally regarded as a warm-up tournament for the upcoming FIFA World Cup and did not carry the same prestige as the World Cup itself.[158] The tournament was discontinued following the 2017 edition with its calendar slot replaced by an expanded FIFA Club World Cup.[160] The UEFA Nations League and the CONCACAF Nations League were introduced in the late 2010s to replace international friendlies during the two-year cycle between major tournaments.[161]  The most prestigious competitions in club football are the respective continental championships, which are generally contested between national champions, for example, the UEFA Champions League in Europe and the Copa Libertadores in South America. The winners of each continental competition contest the FIFA Club World Cup.[162]  The governing bodies in each country operate league systems in a domestic season, normally comprising several divisions, in which the teams gain points throughout the season depending on results. Teams are placed into tables, placing them in order according to points accrued. Most commonly, each team plays every other team in its league at home and away in each season, in a round-robin tournament. At the end of a season, the top team is declared the champion. The top few teams may be promoted to a higher division, and one or more of the teams finishing at the bottom are relegated to a lower division.[164]  The teams finishing at the top of a country's league may also be eligible to play in international club competitions in the following season. The main exceptions to this system occur in some Latin American leagues, which divide football championships into two sections named Apertura and Clausura (Spanish for Opening and Closing), awarding a champion for each.[165] Most countries supplement the league system with one or more \"cup\" competitions organised on a knock-out basis. These include the domestic cup, which may be open to all eligible teams in a country's league system\u2014both professional and amateur\u2014and is organised by the national federation.[166]  Some countries' top divisions feature highly-paid star players; in smaller countries, lower divisions, and many women's clubs, players may be part-timers with a second job, or amateurs. The five top European leagues \u2013 Premier League (England),[167] Bundesliga (Germany), La Liga (Spain), Serie A (Italy), and Ligue 1 (France) \u2013 attract most of the world's best players and, during the 2006\u201307 season, each of these leagues had a total wage cost in excess of \u20ac600 million.[168][needs update] These leagues also generated a combined \u20ac17.2\u00a0billion in revenue in the 2021\u201322 season from television contracts, matchday tickets, sponsorships, and other sources.[169] "},{"title":"Penalty card","content":"  Penalty cards are used in many sports as a means of warning, reprimanding or penalising a player, coach or team official. Penalty cards are most commonly used by referees or umpires to indicate that a player has committed an offence. The official will hold the card above their head while looking or pointing toward the player who has committed the offence. This action makes the decision clear to all players, as well as spectators and other officials in a manner that is language-neutral. The colour or shape of the card used by the official indicates the type or seriousness of the offence and the level of punishment that is to be applied. Yellow and red cards are the most common, typically indicating, respectively, cautions and dismissals.  The idea of using language-neutral coloured cards to communicate a referee's intentions originated in association football, with English referee Ken Aston.[1] Aston had been appointed to the FIFA Referees' Committee and was responsible for all referees at the 1966 FIFA World Cup. In the quarter-finals, England played Argentina at Wembley Stadium. After the match, newspaper reports stated that referee Rudolf Kreitlein had cautioned Englishmen Bobby and Jack Charlton, as well as sent off Argentinian Antonio Ratt\u00edn. The referee had not made his decision clear during the game, so England manager Alf Ramsey approached a FIFA representative for post-match clarification. This incident started Aston thinking about ways to make a referee's decisions clearer to both players and spectators. Aston realised that a colour-coding scheme based on the same principle as used on traffic lights (yellow \u2013 stop if safe to do so, red \u2013 stop) would transcend language barriers and make it clear that a player had been cautioned or expelled.[1] As a result, yellow cards to indicate a caution and red cards to indicate an expulsion were used for the first time  in the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico. The use of penalty cards has since been adopted and expanded by several sporting codes, with each sport adapting the idea to its specific set of rules or laws.  A yellow card is used in many different sporting codes. Its meaning differs among sports; however, it most commonly indicates a caution given to a player regarding their conduct, or indicates a temporary suspension. Examples include:   In association football, a yellow card is shown by the referee to indicate that a player has been officially cautioned.[2] The player's details are then recorded by the referee in a small notebook; hence a caution is also known as a \"booking\". A player who has been cautioned may continue playing in the game; however, a player who receives a second caution in a match is sent off (shown the yellow card again, and then a red card), meaning that they must leave the field immediately and take no further part in the game. The player may not be replaced by a substitute. Law 12 of the Laws of the Game (which are set by the International Football Association Board and used by FIFA) lists the types of offences and misconduct that may result in a caution or is cautionary. Law 12 was amended in 2019 to allow team officials, such as head coaches, to also receive yellow and red cards.[2] It also states that \"only a player, substitute, substituted player or team official\" can be cautioned. A player is usually given a one-match suspension (although it can be more for certain circumstances) after accumulating two yellow cards in a match. The same is generally applied to team officials.[3] In most tournaments, the accumulation of a certain number of yellow cards over several matches results in disqualification of the offending player for a certain number of subsequent matches, the exact number of cards and matches varying by jurisdiction.  In track events, a yellow card is used as a personal warning in both track and field events used to indicate that a second yellow card followed by a red card would result in a disqualification.[4] World Athletics rules have abolished false start warnings; false starts now result in immediate disqualification except in combined events where a diagonal yellow\/black card indicates a warning for false start.[5]  However, as of 2012, the false start rule is that an athlete's hands must leave the track or their feet must leave the starting blocks before the gunshot in order for a false start to be given. Therefore, if an athlete makes a twitch, while being in their final 'set' position, the maximum penalty is a yellow card.  In Australian rules football, a yellow card is issued against a player for committing any reportable offence (such as striking an opponent, swearing at an official, amongst others), except those listed as 'serious' reportable offences. Any player issued a yellow card is unable to participate in the game for the length of a quarter of play, excluding breaks, although the player can be replaced. However, a yellow card may be issued against a player at the discretion of an umpire, despite the player not committing a reportable offence. Yellow cards and red cards are, however, not issued in the Australian Football League, the highest level of play in Australian rules football.[6]  In badminton, a yellow card is given to a singles player or doubles pair as a warning for breaching the Laws of Badminton. A yellow card can only be given once to a player or pair in a match; subsequent breaches are sanctioned with a red or black card.[7][8]  In bandy, a yellow card indicates a warning given to an entire team for technical fouls such as errors in the execution of goal-throws or free strokes, or the obstruction of a player without ball.[9] Subsequent technical fouls by the same team result in a five-minute penalty indicated by a white card.  In canoe polo, a yellow card indicates a player has received a two-minute temporary suspension.[10] A yellow card can be awarded for a deliberate or dangerous foul that prevents the scoring of a near certain goal, dangerous illegal play that is deliberate or repeated, foul or abusive language, continuously disputing a referee's decisions or receiving a third green card for any reason.  In equestrian sports, yellow cards may be issued during FEI sanctioned events for abuse of a horse or incorrect behavior towards an official.[11] Abuse of the horse may include riding an obviously lame horse, riding an exhausted horse, excessive use of whip or spurs, and dangerous riding. Riders may choose not to accept issued cards, but doing so may lead to a disciplinary hearing. A rider receiving a yellow card can be disqualified from the event and subsequently fined or suspended.[11]  In fencing, a yellow card indicates a warning to a fencer and is valid for the remainder of the bout.[12] In some cases, an annulment of any hit scored by the fencer at fault may also occur. Yellow cards are awarded for \"Tier 1\" offenses, such as turning your back to your opponent, covering target area (most common in Foil), leaving the piste without permission, or refusing to obey the referee. A yellow card can also be awarded when, at the first call by the referee, a fencer does not present himself on the piste ready to fence. Any person not on the piste who disturbs the good order of the competition may also receive a yellow card on the first infringement.[12]  Yellow cards in field hockey indicate a temporary suspension of at least 5 minutes. The length of the suspension is determined by the umpire.[13] It is possible for a player to receive two yellow cards for different offences during the same match; however, the period of suspension must be significantly longer with each yellow card. When an offence for which a yellow card has been awarded is repeated, the yellow card must not be used again and a more severe penalty must be awarded. There must also be a clear difference between the duration of a yellow card suspension for a minor offence and the duration for a major offence. The yellow card can be shown to a specific player or to the captain for misconduct by the entire team.[13] In this case, the captain is temporarily suspended.  In the Gaelic games of camogie, Gaelic football, hurling, and ladies' Gaelic football,  yellow cards (Irish: c\u00e1rta bu\u00ed) are given to players for moderate fouls. A player who receives two yellow cards in a single game is sent off and receives a red card. Red and yellow cards were introduced to Gaelic games following an incident during the 1995 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final when the referee sent Charlie Redmond from the field of play but he refused to leave.[14]  A yellow card in handball indicates a warning and can be given to a player or team official for unsportsmanlike conduct, or to a player whose actions are mainly or exclusively directed at the opponent and not at the ball. IHF rules also allow referees to use discretion to award a yellow card outside of these situations.[15]  In loofball, misconduct attracts either a verbal warning, a yellow or red card. While a verbal warning carries no penalty, a yellow card carries a point penalty and a red card carries both a point penalty and disqualification. A player usually gets sanctioned in the following order: first misconduct = verbal warning, second misconduct = yellow card + point to the opposition, third misconduct = red card + point to the opposition + disqualification.  A yellow card in racewalking indicates a competitor's foot fails to be on the ground when the rear leg is being raised, or the front leg is not straightened when it makes contact with the ground.[16]  Yellow cards are not usually used in rugby league in the southern hemisphere with referees indicating a 10-minute suspension by raising both arms straight out with fingers spread (to indicate 10 minutes). This is otherwise known as a \"sin bin\". However, in the northern hemisphere it is common for a referee to use a yellow card in signaling a \"sin bin\" to indicate 10 minutes instead of using the arm and hand signal used in the southern hemisphere. It is possible for a player to receive seven yellow cards without receiving a red card (a player who receives eight yellow cards in a match will receive a red card, which results in ejection from the match). However, it is up to the referee's discretion at how bad the offences are, and in these cases, a red card may be commonly shown for a second major offence without the presence of a second yellow card.  In rugby sevens, any player who commits an offence under World Rugby Law 9 \u2013 Foul Play may be shown a yellow card and suspended from the game for 2 minutes without replacement.[17] Offences include obstruction, unfair play, repeated infringements, dangerous play and misconduct which is prejudicial to the game. Receiving a yellow card is known colloquially as being sent to the \"sin bin\". If that player later commits another yellow-card offence, the player will be shown a red card (see below) and be sent-off.  Under World Rugby Laws, any rugby union player who commits an offence under Law 9 \u2013 Foul Play may be shown a yellow card and suspended from the game for 10 minutes; the player cannot be replaced during that time.[18] Offences include obstruction, unfair play, repeated infringements, dangerous play and misconduct which is prejudicial to the game. Receiving a yellow card is known colloquially as being sent to the \"sin bin\". Players receiving a second yellow card in a game will also be shown a red card (see below) and will be sent off and unable to take part in the remainder of the match.  Under ITTF regulations, a yellow card is shown by the umpire to warn the player if they misbehave. If the player commits a second offence, one point is awarded to the opponent and two points for further offence, each time with a yellow and a red card together shown by the umpire. A yellow card can also be shown to an authorised advisor if they give advice illegally.[19]  Under FIVB rules, receiving a yellow card is the second stage of a formal warning for a player(s)\/coach for minor misconduct, the first being a verbal one given through the team captain. It is recorded on the scoresheet but has no immediate consequences; there is no loss of service (if applicable) and no point awarded to the opposition. It is shown together with a red card (in one hand) where a player(s)\/coach is sanctioned with expulsion, and (with a card in each hand) separately with a red card where a player(s)\/coach is sanctioned with disqualification, all such offences are recorded on the scoresheet.  Yellow cards are given in water polo as an official warning for disrespectful conduct from the coach, individual players, or the entire bench.  In Germany, Austria, and Calgary, Canada, yellow cards were traditionally given for a first or second severe infraction of the rules in wrestling.  A red card is used in several different sporting codes. Its meaning differs among sports, but it most commonly indicates a serious offence and often results in a player being permanently suspended from the game (commonly known as an ejection, dismissal, disqualification, expulsion, removal, or sending-off). In many sports the ejected player's team cannot replace them and thus must continue the rest of the game with one fewer player, which may be a significant disadvantage. Examples include:  In association football, a red card is shown by a referee to signify that a player has been sent off.[2] A player who has been sent off is required to leave the field of play immediately and must take no further part in the game.  The player who has been sent off cannot be replaced during the game; their team must continue the game with one player fewer. Only players, substitutes, substituted players and team officials may receive a red card. If a goalkeeper receives a red card another player must assume goalkeeping duties (so teams will usually substitute an outfield player for another goalkeeper if this option is available). A red card will be shown to a player who has committed a serious or extreme offense such as violent conduct or an illegal and purposeful obstruction of a goal scoring opportunity for the opposing team. A red card will also be shown to a player who accumulates two yellow cards for more minor offenses.  A red card in athletics indicates that the athlete is disqualified after receiving two yellow cards. A diagonal red\/black card is issued if a false start has been made.[4]  In Australian rules football, a red card is issued against a player who has accumulated two yellow cards over the course of a match, or has committed a 'serious reportable offence' (such as striking an umpire or kicking an opponent). A player issued with a red card may not participate for the remainder of the match; however, unlike most sports, the player can be replaced, although not until a length of time equivalent to one-quarter (excluding breaks) has elapsed. Yellow cards and red cards are, however, not issued in the Australian Football League, the highest level of play in Australian rules football.[6]  In badminton, a red card is given to a singles player or doubles pair to penalize subsequent infractions after receiving a yellow card. It counts as fault, meaning the opposing side is awarded a point. After a second red card, a player or pair may be disqualified with a black card at the tournament referee's discretion.[7][8]  A red card in bandy indicates a match penalty, i.e. a player has been excluded for the remainder of the match and cannot be substituted.[9] Red card offenses include directly attacking an opponent or using abusive language. A coach or substitute may also be penalized with a red card. In this situation, a player currently on the rink also serves a ten-minute penalty, resulting in the number of players being reduced by one.  A red card in canoe polo indicates a player has been sent off for the remainder of the match and cannot be substituted.[10] A red card can be awarded if a personal attack on a player occurs, repeated foul or abusive language, or when the award of a yellow card is disputed or has not had the desired effect of causing the player to control his play or attitude. A red card is also awarded when a player has received a second yellow card for any reason.  Red cards are used in some cricket tournaments as part of efforts to  penalise fielding sides for slow over rates. The penalised team's captain must select a teammate to be removed, and their side must complete the innings with one fewer fielder.[20]  In fencing, a red card is used to indicate that a fencer has committed an offence that warrants a penalty hit to be awarded to the opponent.[12] Second and subsequent Group 1 offences, all Group 2 offences and first Group 3 offences are penalised with a red card.[12] A red card may also be awarded when, at the second call by the referee, a fencer does not present himself on the piste ready to fence.  A red card in field hockey results in a player being permanently suspended from the game. The player cannot take any further part in the game and cannot be substituted. Unlike other penalty cards in field hockey, the red card is never given to the captain for team misconduct. In addition to their colour, red cards in field hockey are often circular in shape.[13]  In floorball, a red card is results in the player being ejected from the game and his\/her team being penalised with a 5-minute bench penalty. In floorball, the red card can be linked with 3 different types of Match Penalties (MP 1, 2 and 3). MP1 is linked with violent play during the game, such as heavy hits (pushing) against the goal-cage or boarding; this penalty does not cause additional suspension in the tournament. MP2 is linked with offences such as sabotage of the game, mild brawl (no punches), and is also given when a player receives his\/her second 5-minute bench penalty; this match penalty causes an automatic 1-game suspension. MP3 is linked with vulgar conduct, such as insulting the referee, another player or spectators, violent conduct that is not directly linked with play (such as punching an opponent); this match penalty causes an automatic 1-game suspension, and is further reviewed by a disciplinary committee that can penalise the player with additional suspension.  In camogie, Gaelic football, hurling and ladies' Gaelic football a red card (Irish: c\u00e1rta dearg) is given to players for serious fouls and violent conduct. A player who receives two yellow cards in a single game is sent off and receives a red card. Red and yellow cards were introduced to Gaelic games following an incident during the 1995 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final when the referee sent Charlie Redmond from the field of play but he refused to leave.[14]  A red card in handball indicates a disqualification of a player who has committed an offense such as unsportsmanlike conduct, serious foul play, or receiving a third two-minute suspension.[15] A red card prevents a player from playing for the remainder of the match and as a result reduces the number of players that are available to a team.  A red card also carries a two-minute suspension for the team, meaning that a team cannot replace the disqualified player until the two-minute team suspension has expired.[15]  In quadball a red card results in a player being ejected from the game. In addition, a substitute must go to the penalty box for two minutes. The entire two minutes must be served, regardless of any scores by the opposing team during that time. The player's team must play a player down while the substitute is in the penalty box.[21]  In racewalking, a red card indicates that a competitor's foot failed to be on the ground when the rear leg is being raised or that his front leg is not straightened when it makes contact with the ground.  A judge would issue a yellow card for the first infraction committed by a competitor. And if the same judge detects the second infraction from the same competitor, a red card is issued.  Three red cards, from three different judges, will result in a competitor's disqualification.[16]  In water polo, a red card is issued to a coach, player, or team official on the bench for a second incident of misconduct after receiving a yellow card or severe unsporting conduct. A person receiving a red card must leave the competition area.  In the same territories as listed above under yellow cards, red cards were traditionally given for a third severe infraction of the rules, signifying disqualification.  Under ITTF regulations, if after a warning the player misbehaves again, the umpire will show him or her a yellow card and a red card together and award one point to the opponent for the second offence and two for the third one. In case a player commits a serious offence or continues to misbehave after 3 points are awarded to the opponent for misbehavior, the umpire will suspend play and report to the referee, who has the power to disqualify the player from the match, showing a red card. The umpire can show a red card to an authorised advisor and ask them to leave the playing area if they give illegal advice after a warning had been given.[19]  A green card is used in some sports to indicate an official warning to a player who has committed a minor offence that does not warrant a more serious, extreme or further sanction.  Among others, Italy\u2019s Serie B uses green cards to display a positive action by a player. The only positive card a referee has, it helps determine sportsmanship awards at the end of the season. On the other hand, in some instances, a green card is used for discipline. In some smaller leagues, a green card is used for situations such as unsportsmanlike conduct, diving, or minor dissent. In the 2018 CONIFA World Cup, any player given a green card had to exit the field right away. Teams that had a substitution available could bring in another player as a replacement, but those who had no more replacements left had to play with one less player.[22][23]  A green card indicates that the recall did not warrant a warning, which most commonly happens when the machines used to catch false-starters making a mistake.[4]  A green card indicates an official warning that can be applied to an individual player or a whole team.[10] A green card can be awarded for deliberate unsporting behavior or unnecessary verbal communication to the referee.  A green card indicates an official warning when a minor offence has occurred resulting in a 2 minute suspension. A second green card for the same player will result in a yellow card (5 minute suspension). In this case, the umpire will show a green card, followed by a yellow card. When an offence for which a green card has been awarded is repeated, a yellow card should be awarded. A green card can be given to a specific player or to the captain as a warning to the entire team. Cards shown to the captain as a warning to the team are treated separate from cards shown to the captain as a player. A captain who receives a green card is \u2018cautioned\u2019 rather than suspended (as with a yellow or red card) and therefore this does not need an alternate captain to be named on the field. In addition to their colour, green cards in field hockey are triangular in shape.[13] Under FIH Rules of Hockey, the green card carries a two-minute suspension during which time that player's team plays with one fewer player.  In a women's cup game between Benfica and Sporting in Portugal, a white card has been shown to praise fair play for the first time in association football history.[24]  A white card is used in bandy to indicate a five-minute timed penalty given to a player.[9] The offending player must leave the playing area and wait on a penalty bench near the centre line until the penalty has expired. During the 5 minute period the player may not be replaced, although he or she may be replaced with a different player when the penalty has expired. Offences that can warrant a white card include trying to hinder the opponents from executing a free-stroke, illegal substitution or repeated illegal but non-violent attacks on an opponent.  In the 2012 Super Rugby season in rugby union, a White Card was introduced for incidents of suspected foul play where the referee is unsure of the identity of the perpetrator, or where the referee is unsure if a red card is warranted. The incident is later referred to the citing commissioner, and may result in a suspension for the offending player.[25] It is similar to a citation sign (arms crossed above the head) in rugby league. However, in 2013 the International Rugby Board, now known as World Rugby, extended the powers of the TMO to include reviewing suspected incidents of foul play.[26] As a result, the white cards were obsolete a year after they have been introduced.[27]  A blue card is frequently used in indoor soccer in the United States as a level below a yellow card for offenses such as breaking house safety rules, spitting on the field, committing minor physical fouls, or illegal substitutions,[22] signifying that the offender must leave the field and stay in a penalty box (usually 2\u20135 minutes), during which time their team plays down a man (identical to ice hockey and roller hockey). If a goal is scored by the team opposite of the offender, then the offender may return to the field immediately. It is also used in the Clericus Cup association football league for a 5-minute bench penalty for unsportsmanlike play, and it is used in beach soccer for a 2-minute bench penalty for unsportsmanlike play.  Plans for the introduction of the blue card more widely were expected to be published by the International Football Association Board (IFAB), on 9 February 2024 but were delayed; the new protocols around the penalty are expected to be the subject of further discussion at IFAB's annual general meeting at Loch Lomond on 2 March 2024 and then published.[28]  A blue card is used in bandy to indicate a ten-minute timed penalty given to a player.[9] The offending player must leave the playing area and wait on a penalty bench near the centre line until the penalty has expired. During the 10 minute period the player may not be replaced, although he or she may be replaced with a different player when the penalty has expired. A blue card is typically shown for offences that are more serious than those warranting a white card including attacking an opponent in a violent or dangerous way, causing advantage by intentionally stopping the ball with a high stick or protesting a referee's decision.  The blue card has been in use in handball since the International Handball Federation announced a rule change that came into effect on July 1, 2016.[29] First the Red Card is shown, then the referee will after a short discussion show the blue card. Following that a written report will accompany the score sheet and the Disciplinary Commission will then decide on further actions against the player.[30]  A blue card is also used in quidditch to indicate a technical foul. The fouling player is sent to the penalty box for one minute or until a goal is scored against the fouling player's team. Unlike a yellow card, there is no additional penalty for multiple blue cards.[21]  A black card is used in the sport of badminton to indicate disqualification.[31]  A black card is used in fencing. It is issued by the director or the referee for severe rule infractions.[12] A second instance of a Group 3 offence, and all Group 4 offences including deliberate brutality, refusal to fence, refusal to salute, and refusal to shake hands can be punished with a black card.[12] When the black card is issued, the offending fencer is excluded or eliminated from the remainder of the competition and may be suspended from further tournaments. In the official record of the tournament, their name is replaced with the words \"FENCER EXCLUDED\".[32]  In the Gaelic games of Gaelic football and hurling, a tick or black book was formerly recorded against a player for a minor infringement not warranting a yellow card, though multiple bookings will result in the issuance of a yellow card. The act of the referee physically holding up his black notebook in the same manner as a card has been discontinued by the Gaelic Athletic Association.[33]  Since 1 January 2014, a player in Gaelic football can be ordered off the pitch for the remainder of the game with a substitution allowed by being shown a black card (the referee's black notebook) in the same manner as any other penalty card for \"cynical behaviour,\" including blatant tripping, pulling down and bodychecking. This forced substitution is an intermediate punishment between the yellow and red cards. A player who receives a yellow card and a black card in the same game is sent off without any substitute being permitted.[34]  As of January 2020, a player who receives a black card is ejected from the field to the sin bin for a period of ten minutes. The player may return to the field after this period has elapsed, during a break in play with the permission of the referee. If a match extends into extra time and the player has not been in the sin bin for ten minutes, they must serve any remaining time before rejoining play. As in previous years, a player who receives both a yellow card and a black card or two black cards is then shown a red card and ejected for the remainder of the match and cannot be replaced.[35] "},{"title":"Improvised explosive device","content":"  An improvised explosive device (IED) is a bomb constructed and deployed in ways other than in conventional military action. It may be constructed of conventional military explosives, such as an artillery shell, attached to a detonating mechanism. IEDs are commonly used as roadside bombs, or homemade bombs.   The term \"IED\" was coined by the British Army during the Northern Ireland conflict to refer to booby traps made by the IRA, and entered common use in the U.S. during the Iraq War.[1][2]  IEDs are generally utilized in terrorist operations or in asymmetric unconventional warfare or urban warfare by insurgent guerrillas or commando forces in a theatre of operations.[3][4] In the Iraq War (2003\u20132011), insurgents used IEDs extensively against U.S.-led forces, and by the end of 2007, IEDs were responsible for approximately 63% of coalition deaths in Iraq.[5] They were also used in Afghanistan by insurgent groups, and caused over 66% of coalition casualties in the 2001\u20132021 Afghanistan War.[6][7]  IEDs were also used frequently by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka during the Sri Lankan Civil War,[8][9] and by Ambazonian separatists in the ongoing Anglophone Crisis.[10]  An IED is a bomb fabricated in an improvised manner incorporating destructive, lethal, noxious, pyrotechnic, or incendiary chemicals and designed to destroy or incapacitate personnel or vehicles. In some cases, IEDs are used to distract, disrupt, or delay an opposing force, facilitating another type of attack.[11] IEDs may incorporate military or commercially sourced explosives, and often combine both types, or they may otherwise be made with homemade explosives (HME).[citation needed] An HME lab refers to a Homemade Explosive Lab, or the physical location where the devices are crafted.[citation needed]  An IED has five components: a switch (activator), an initiator (fuse), container (body), charge (explosive), and a power source (battery). An IED designed for use against armoured targets such as personnel carriers or tanks will be designed for armour penetration, by using a shaped charge that creates an explosively formed penetrator.  IEDs are extremely diverse in design and may contain many types of initiators, detonators, penetrators, and explosive loads.[citation needed]  Antipersonnel IEDs typically also contain fragmentation-generating objects such as nails, ball bearings or even small rocks to cause wounds at greater distances than blast pressure alone could.[citation needed] In the conflicts of the 21st century, anti-personnel improvised explosive devices (IED) have partially replaced conventional or military landmines as the source of injury to dismounted (pedestrian) soldiers and civilians.[citation needed] These injuries were reported in BMJ Open to be far worse with IEDs than with landmines resulting in multiple limb amputations and lower body mutilation.[12] This combination of injuries has been given the name \"Dismounted Complex Blast Injury\" and is thought to be the worst survivable injury ever seen in war.[13]  IEDs are triggered by various methods, including remote control, infrared or magnetic triggers, pressure-sensitive bars or trip wires (victim-operated). In some cases, multiple IEDs are wired together in a daisy chain to attack a convoy of vehicles[14] spread out along a roadway.  IEDs made by inexperienced designers or with substandard materials may fail to detonate, and in some cases, they detonate on either the maker or the placer of the device. Some groups, however, have been known to produce sophisticated devices constructed with components scavenged from conventional munitions and standard consumer electronics components, such as mobile phones, consumer-grade two-way radios, washing machine timers, pagers, or garage door openers.[citation needed] The sophistication of an IED depends on the training of the designer and the tools and materials available.  IEDs may use artillery shells or conventional high-explosive charges as their explosive load as well as homemade explosives. However, the threat exists that toxic chemical, biological, or radioactive (dirty bomb) material may be added to a device, thereby creating other life-threatening effects beyond the shrapnel, concussive blasts and fire normally associated with bombs. Chlorine liquid has been added to IEDs in Iraq, producing clouds of chlorine gas.[citation needed]  A vehicle-borne IED, or VBIED, is a military term for a car bomb or truck bomb but can be any type of transportation such as a bicycle, motorcycle, donkey (DBIED[15]), etc. They are typically employed by insurgents, in particular ISIS,[citation needed] and can carry a relatively large payload. They can also be detonated from a remote location. VBIEDs can create additional shrapnel through the destruction of the vehicle itself and use vehicle fuel as an incendiary weapon. The act of a person's being in this vehicle and detonating it is known as an SVBIED suicide.  Of increasing popularity among insurgent forces in Iraq is the house-borne IED, or HBIED, from the common military practice of clearing houses; insurgents rig an entire house to detonate and collapse shortly after a clearing squad has entered.[citation needed]  The Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms (JCS Pub 1-02) includes two definitions for improvised devices: improvised explosive devices (IED) and improvised nuclear device (IND).[16] These definitions address the Nuclear and Explosive in CBRNe. That leaves chemical, biological and radiological undefined. Four definitions have been created to build on the structure of the JCS definition. Terms have been created to standardize the language of first responders and members of the military and to correlate the operational picture.[17]  A device placed or fabricated in an improvised manner incorporating destructive, lethal, noxious, pyrotechnic, or incendiary chemicals and designed to destroy, incapacitate, harass, or distract. It may incorporate military stores, but is normally devised from non-military components.[11]  IEDs have been deployed in the form of explosively formed projectiles (EFP), a special type of shaped charge that is effective at long standoffs from the target (50 meters or more), however they are not accurate at long distances.  This is because of how they are produced.  The large \"slug\" projected from the explosion has no stabilization because it has no tail fins and it does not spin like a bullet from a rifle.  Without this stabilization the trajectory can not be accurately determined beyond 50 meters.  An EFP is essentially a cylindrical shaped charge with a machined concave metal disc (often copper) in front, pointed inward. The force of the shaped charge turns the disc into a high velocity slug, capable of penetrating the armor of most vehicles in Iraq.  Directionally focused charges (also known as directionally focused fragmentary charges depending on the construction) are very similar to EFPs, with the main difference being that the top plate is usually flat and not concave. It also is not made with machined copper but much cheaper cast or cut metal. When made for fragmentation, the contents of the charge are usually nuts, bolts, ball bearings and other similar shrapnel products and explosive. If it only consists of the flat metal plate, it is known as a platter charge, serving a similar role as an EFP with reduced effect but easier construction.[18]  A device incorporating the toxic attributes of chemical materials designed to result in the dispersal of toxic chemical materials for the purpose of creating a primary patho-physiological toxic effect (morbidity and mortality), or secondary psychological effect (causing fear and behavior modification) on a larger population. Such devices may be fabricated in a completely improvised manner or may be an improvised modification to an existing weapon.[citation needed]  A device incorporating biological materials designed to result in the dispersal of vector borne biological material for the purpose of creating a primary patho-physiological toxic effect (morbidity and mortality), or secondary psychological effect (causing fear and behavior modification) on a larger population.   A device making use of exothermic chemical reactions designed to result in the rapid spread of fire for the purpose of creating a primary patho-physiological effect (morbidity and mortality), or secondary psychological effect (causing fear and behavior modification) on a larger population or it may be used with the intent of gaining a tactical advantage. Such devices may be fabricated in a completely improvised manner or may be an improvised modification to an existing weapon. A common type of this is the Molotov cocktail.[citation needed]  A speculative device incorporating radioactive materials designed to result in the dispersal of radioactive material for the purpose of area denial and economic damage, and\/or for the purpose of creating a primary patho-physiological toxic effect (morbidity and mortality), or secondary psychological effect (causing fear and behavior modification) on a larger population. Such devices may be fabricated in a completely improvised manner or may be an improvised modification to an existing nuclear weapon. Also called a Radiological Dispersion Device (RDD) or \"dirty bomb\".[citation needed]  Improvised nuclear device of most likely gun-type or implosion-type.  A vehicle may be laden with explosives, set to explode by remote control or by a passenger\/driver, commonly known as a car bomb or vehicle-borne IED (VBIED, pronounced vee-bid). On occasion the driver of the car bomb may have been coerced into delivery of the vehicle under duress, a situation known as a proxy bomb. Distinguishing features are low-riding vehicles with excessive weight, vehicles with only one passenger, and ones where the interior of the vehicles look as if they have been stripped down and built back up.[19] Car bombs can carry thousands of pounds of explosives[20] and may be augmented with shrapnel to increase fragmentation.  ISIS has used truck bombs with devastating effects.[21][22][23]  Water-borne Improvised Explosive Devices (WBIED), i.e. boats carrying explosives, can be used against ships and areas connected to water.   An early example of this type was the Japanese Shinyo suicide boats during World War II.[24] The boats were filled with explosives and attempted to ram Allied ships, sometimes successfully, having sunk or severely damaged several American ships by war's end. Suicide bombers used a boat-borne IED to attack the USS Cole; US and UK troops have also been killed by boat-borne IEDs in Iraq.[25][26] The Tamil Tigers Sea Tigers have also been known to use SWBIEDs during the Sri Lankan Civil War.  WBIEDs have been used in the Red Sea.[27][28]  Monkeys and war pigs were used as incendiaries around 1000 AD.[29] More famously the \"anti-tank dog\" and \"bat bomb\" were developed during World War II. In recent times, a two-year-old child and seven other people were killed by explosives strapped to a horse in the town of Chita in Colombia.[30] The carcasses of certain animals were also used to conceal explosive devices by the Iraqi insurgency.[citation needed]  IEDs strapped to the necks of farmers have been used on at least three occasions by guerrillas in Colombia, as a way of extortion.[31][32] American pizza delivery man Brian Douglas Wells was killed in 2003 by an explosive fastened to his neck, purportedly under duress from the maker of the bomb.[33] In 2011 a schoolgirl in Sydney, Australia had a suspected collar bomb attached to her by an attacker in her home. The device was removed by police after a ten-hour operation and proved to be a hoax.[34]  Suicide bombing usually refers to an individual wearing explosives and detonating them to kill others including themselves, the bomber will conceal explosives on and around their person, commonly using a vest, and will use a timer or some other trigger to detonate the explosives. The logic behind such attacks is the belief that an IED delivered by a human has a greater chance of achieving success than any other method of attack. In addition, there is the psychological impact of child soldiers prepared to deliberately sacrifice themselves for their cause.[35]  In May 2012 American counter-terrorism officials leaked their acquisition of documents describing the preparation and use of surgically implanted improvised explosive devices.[36][37][38] The devices were designed to evade detection. The devices were described as containing no metal, so they could not be detected by X-rays.  Security officials referred to bombs being surgically implanted into suicide bombers' \"love handles\".[36]  According to the Daily Mirror UK security officials at MI-6 asserted that female bombers could travel undetected carrying the explosive chemicals in otherwise standard breast implants.[39][40] The bomber would blow up the implanted explosives by injecting a chemical trigger.[38]  Robots could also be used to carry explosives. First such documented case was during the aftermath of 2016 shooting of Dallas police officers when a bomb disposal robot was used to deliver explosives to kill Micah Xavier Johnson, who was hiding in a place inaccessible to police snipers.[41] As well, drones carrying explosives were used in a suspected assassination attempt against Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in 2018.[42]  ISIS[43] and Al-Nusra[44] have used bombs detonated in tunnels dug under targets.  In 2008, rocket-propelled IEDs, dubbed Improvised Rocket Assisted Munitions, Improvised Rocket Assisted Mortars and (IRAM) by the military, came to be employed in numbers against U.S. forces in Iraq. They have been described as propane tanks packed with explosives and powered by 107 mm rockets.[45] They are similar to some Provisional IRA barrack buster mortars. New types of IRAMs including Volcano IRAM[46] and Elephant Rockets,[47][48] are used during the Syrian Civil War.[46]  Improvised mortars have been used by many insurgent groups including during the civil war in Syria and Boko Haram insurgency.[49] IRA used improvised mortars called barrack busters.  Improvised artillery including hell cannons are used by rebel forces during Syrian Civil War.  Command-wire improvised, explosive devices (CWIED) use an electrical firing cable that affords the user complete control over the device right up until the moment of initiation.[35]  The trigger for a radio-controlled improvised explosive device (RCIED) is controlled by radio link. The device is constructed so that the receiver is connected to an electrical firing circuit and the transmitter operated by the perpetrator at a distance. A signal from the transmitter causes the receiver to trigger a firing pulse that operates the switch. Usually the switch fires an initiator; however, the output may also be used to remotely arm an explosive circuit. Often the transmitter and receiver operate on a matched coding system that prevents the RCIED from being initiated by spurious radio frequency signals or jamming.[35] An RCIED can be triggered from any number of different radio-frequency based mechanisms including handheld remote control transmitters, car alarms, wireless door bells, cell phones, pagers and portable two-way radios, including those designed for the UHF PMR446, FRS, and GMRS services.[35]  A radio-controlled IED (RCIED) incorporating a mobile phone that is modified and connected to an electrical firing circuit. Mobile phones operate in the UHF band in line of sight with base transceiver station (BTS) antennae sites. In the common scenario, receipt of a paging signal by phone is sufficient to initiate the IED firing circuit.[35]  Victim-operated improvised explosive devices (VOIED), also known as booby traps, are designed to function upon contact with a victim. VOIED switches are often well hidden from the victim or disguised as innocuous everyday objects. They are operated by means of movement. Switching methods include tripwire, pressure mats, spring-loaded release, push, pull or tilt. Common forms of VOIED include the under-vehicle IED (UVIED), improvised landmines, and mail bombs.[35]  The British accused Iran and Hezbollah of teaching Iraqi fighters to use infrared light beams to trigger IEDs. As the occupation forces became more sophisticated in interrupting radio signals around their convoys, the insurgents adapted their triggering methods.[50] In some cases, when a more advanced method was disrupted, the insurgents regressed to using uninterruptible means, such as hard wires from the IED to detonator; however, this method is much harder to effectively conceal. It later emerged however, that these \"advanced\" IEDs were actually old IRA technology. The infrared beam method was perfected by the IRA in the early 1990s after it acquired the technology from a botched undercover British Army operation. Many of the IEDs being used against the invading coalition forces in Iraq were originally developed by the British Army who unintentionally passed the information on to the IRA.[51] The IRA taught their techniques to the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the knowledge spread to Iraq.[52]  Counter-IED efforts are done primarily by military, law enforcement, diplomatic, financial, and intelligence communities and involve a comprehensive approach to countering the threat networks that employ IEDs, not just efforts to defeat the devices themselves.  Because the components of these devices are being used in a manner not intended by their manufacturer, and because the method of producing the explosion is limited only by the science and imagination of the perpetrator, it is not possible to follow a step-by-step guide to detect and disarm a device that an individual has only recently developed. As such, explosive ordnance disposal (IEDD) operators must be able to fall back on their extensive knowledge of the first principles of explosives and ammunition, to try and deduce what the perpetrator has done, and only then to render it safe and dispose of or exploit the device.  Beyond this, as the stakes increase and IEDs are emplaced not only to achieve the direct effect, but to deliberately target IEDD operators and cordon personnel, the IEDD operator needs to have a deep understanding of tactics to ensure they are neither setting up any of their team or the cordon troops for an attack, nor walking into one themselves. The presence of chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) material in an IED requires additional precautions. As with other missions, the EOD operator provides the area commander with an assessment of the situation and of support needed to complete the mission.[citation needed]  Military and law enforcement personnel from around the world have developed a number of render-safe procedures (RSPs) to deal with IEDs.  RSPs may be developed as a result of direct experience with devices or by applied research designed to counter the threat. The supposed effectiveness of IED jamming systems, including vehicle- and personally-mounted systems, has caused IED technology to essentially regress to command-wire detonation methods.[citation needed] These are physical connections between the detonator and explosive device and cannot be jammed. However, these types of IEDs are more difficult to emplace quickly, and are more readily detected.  Military forces and law enforcement from India, Canada, United Kingdom, Israel, Spain, and the United States are at the forefront of counter-IED efforts, as all have direct experience in dealing with IEDs used against them in conflict or terrorist attacks. From the research and development side, programs such as the new Canadian Unmanned Systems Challenge will bring student groups together to invent an unmanned device to both locate IEDs and pinpoint the insurgents.[53]  The fougasse was improvised for centuries, eventually inspiring factory-made land mines. Ernst J\u00fcnger mentions in his war memoir the systematic use of IEDs and booby traps to cover the retreat of German troops at the Somme region during World War I. Another early example of coordinated large-scale use of IEDs was the Belarusian Rail War launched by Belarusian guerrillas against the Germans during World War II.[54][55] Both command-detonated and delayed-fuse IEDs were used to derail thousands of German trains during 1943\u20131944.[56]  Starting six months before the invasion of Afghanistan by the USSR on 27 December 1979, the Afghan Mujahideen were supplied by the CIA, among others, with large quantities of military supplies. Among those supplies were many types of anti-tank mines. The insurgents often removed the explosives from several foreign anti-tank mines, and combined the explosives in tin cooking-oil cans for a more powerful blast. By combining the explosives from several mines and placing them in tin cans, the insurgents made them more powerful, but sometimes also easier to detect by Soviet sappers using mine detectors. After an IED was detonated, the insurgents often used direct-fire weapons such as machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades to continue the attack.  Afghan insurgents operating far from the border with Pakistan did not have a ready supply of foreign anti-tank mines. They preferred to make IEDs from Soviet unexploded ordnance. The devices were rarely triggered by pressure fuses. They were almost always remotely detonated. Since the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, the Taliban and its supporters have used IEDs against NATO and Afghan military and civilian vehicles. This has become the most common method of attack against NATO forces, with IED attacks increasing consistently year on year.  A brigade commander said that sniffer dogs are the most reliable way of detecting IEDs.[57] However, statistical evidence gathered by the US Army Maneuver Support Center at Fort Leonard Wood, MO shows that the dogs are not the most effective means of detecting IEDs.[58][59][60] The U.S. Army's 10th Mountain Division was the first unit to introduce explosive detection dogs[61] in southern Afghanistan. In less than two years the dogs discovered 15 tons of illegal munitions, IED's, and weapons.[62]  In July 2012 it was reported that \"sticky bombs\", magnetically adhesive IED's that were prevalent in the Iraq War, showed up in Afghanistan.[63][64] By 2021 there was at least one sticky bomb attack a day in Kabul. They are used in both traditional assassinations and targeted killings and as terror weapons against the population at large.[65]  In November 2013 one of the largest IEDs constructed was intercepted near Gardez City in Eastern Afghanistan.  The 61,000 pounds of explosives was hidden under what appeared to be piles of wood.  By comparison, the truck bomb that all but razed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City and killed 168 people in 1995 weighed less than 5,000 pounds.[66] A United States Army Corps of Engineers officer assigned to the nearby FOB Lightning analyzed the potential blast damage, which resulted in closing FOB Goode due to its proximity to the highway.[67]  ISAF troops stationed in Afghanistan and other IED prone areas of operation would commonly \"BIP\" (blow in place) IED's and other explosives that were considered too dangerous to defuse.  IEDs are being used by insurgents against government forces during the insurgency in Egypt (2013\u2013present)[68] and the Sinai insurgency.[69]  IEDs are increasingly being used by Maoists in India.[when?][70]  On 13 July 2011, three IEDs were used by the Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir to carry out a coordinated attack on the city of Mumbai, killing 19 people and injuring 130 more.[71][72]  On 21 February 2013, two IEDs were used to carry out bombings in the Indian city of Hyderabad. The bombs exploded in Dilsukhnagar, a crowded shopping area of the city, within 150 metres of each other.[73]  On 17 April 2013, two kilos of explosives used in Bangalore bomb blast at Malleshwaram area, leaving 16 injured and no fatalities. Intelligence sources have said the bomb was an Improvised Explosive Device or IED.[74]  On 21 May 2014, Indinthakarai village supporters of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant were targeted by opponents using over half a dozen crude \"country-made bombs\". It was further reported that there had been at least four similar bombings in Tamil Nadu during the preceding year.[75]  On 28 December 2014, a minor explosion took place near the Coconut Grove restaurant at Church Street in Bangalore on Sunday around 8:30\u00a0pm. One woman was killed and another injured in the blast.[76]  During the 2016 Pathankot attack, several casualties came from IEDs.[77]  On 14 February 2019 in 2019 Pulwama attack, several casualties were reported due to IED blast.[78]  On 29 October 2023, a series of IED explosions were used to kill 2 attendees at a Jehovah's Witnesses Convention in Kalamassery, India.[79]  In the 2003\u20132011 Iraq War, IEDs have been used extensively against Coalition forces and by the end of 2007 they have been responsible for at least 64% of Coalition deaths in Iraq.[5]  Since the detonation of the first IED in Iraq in 2003, more than 81,000 IED attacks have occurred in the country, killing and wounding 21,200 Americans.[80]  Beginning in July 2003, the Iraqi insurgency used IEDs to target invading coalition vehicles. According to The Washington Post, 64% of U.S. deaths in Iraq occurred due to IEDs.[81] A French study[25] showed that in Iraq, from March 2003 to November 2006, on a global 3,070 deaths in the US-led invading coalition soldiers, 1,257 were caused by IEDs, i.e. 41%. That is to say more than in the \"normal fights\" (1027 dead, 34%). Insurgents now[when?] use the bombs to target not only invading coalition vehicles but Iraqi police as well.  Common locations for placing these bombs on the ground include animal carcasses, soft drink cans, and boxes.  Typically, they explode underneath or to the side of the vehicle to cause the maximum amount of damage. However, as vehicle armour was improved on military vehicles, insurgents began placing IEDs in elevated positions such as on road signs, utility poles, or trees, to hit less protected areas.  IEDs in Iraq may be made with artillery or mortar shells or with varying amounts of bulk or homemade explosives.  Early during the Iraq war, the bulk explosives were often obtained from stored munitions bunkers to include stripping landmines of their explosives.  Despite the increased armor, IEDs are killing military personnel and civilians with greater frequency. May 2007 was the deadliest month for IED attacks thus far, with a reported 89 of the 129 invading coalition casualties coming from an IED attack.[5] According to the Pentagon, 250,000 tons (out of 650,000 tons total) of Iraqi heavy ordnance were looted, providing a large supply of ammunition for the insurgents.  In October 2005, the UK government charged that Iran was supplying insurgents with the technological know-how to make shaped charge IEDs.[82] Both Iranian and Iraqi government officials denied the allegations.[83][84]  During the Iraqi Civil War (2014\u20132017), ISIL has made extensive use of suicide VBIEDs, often driven by children, elderly and disabled.[85][86][87]  On August 27, 2023, Israeli security forces successfully foiled an attempt to smuggle Iranian-made explosives into Israel from Jordan. The thwarted smuggling operation in the Jordan Valley aimed to supply terror groups in the West Bank with explosives. Counter-smuggling efforts along the border have led to increased seizures of weapons and explosive devices.[88]  From 1912-1913, the Suffragettes utilised IEDs in the Suffragette bombing and arson campaign.  Throughout the Troubles, the Provisional Irish Republican Army made extensive use of IEDs in their 1969\u201397 campaign, much of which were made in the Republic of Ireland.[89][90] They used barrack buster mortars and remote-controlled IEDs. Members of the IRA developed and counter-developed devices and tactics. IRA bombs became highly sophisticated, featuring anti-handling devices such as a mercury tilt switch or microswitches. These devices would detonate the bomb if it was moved in any way. Typically, the safety-arming device used was a clockwork Memopark timer, which armed the bomb up to 60 minutes after it was placed[91] by completing an electrical circuit supplying power to the anti-handling device. Depending on the particular design (e.g., boobytrapped briefcase or car bomb) an independent electrical circuit supplied power to a conventional timer set for the intended time delay, e.g. 40 minutes. However, some electronic delays developed by IRA technicians could be set to accurately detonate a bomb weeks after it was hidden, which is what happened in the Brighton hotel bomb attack of 1984. Initially, bombs were detonated either by timer or by simple command wire. Later, bombs could be detonated by radio control. Initially, simple servos from radio-controlled aircraft were used to close the electrical circuit and supply power to the detonator. After the British developed jammers, IRA technicians introduced devices that required a sequence of pulsed radio codes to arm and detonate them. These were harder to jam.  The IRA as well as Ulster loyalist paramilitaries have also utilized less sophisticated devices, such as homemade grenades crudely thrown at the target.  These are sometimes called \"blast bombs\".[92]  Roadside bombs were extensively used by the IRA. Typically, a roadside bomb was placed in a drain or culvert along a rural road and detonated by remote control when British security forces vehicles were passing, as with the case of the 1979 Warrenpoint ambush. As a result of the use of these bombs, the British military stopped transport by road in areas such as South Armagh, and used helicopter transport instead to avoid the danger.  Most IEDs used commercial or homemade explosives made in the Republic of Ireland, with ingredients such as gelignite and ANFO either stolen in construction sites or provided for by supporters in the South,[93][89][90] although the use of Semtex-H smuggled in from Libya in the 1980s was also common from the mid-1980s onward. Bomb Disposal teams from 321 EOD manned by Ammunition Technicians were deployed in those areas to deal with the IED threat. The IRA also used secondary devices to catch British reinforcements sent in after an initial blast as occurred in the Warrenpoint Ambush. Between 1970 and 2005, the IRA detonated 19,000 IEDs in the Northern Ireland and Britain, an average of one every 17 hours for three and a half decades, arguably making it \"the biggest terrorist bombing campaign in history\".[94]  In the early 1970s, at the height of the IRA campaign, the British Army unit tasked with rendering safe IEDs, 321 EOD, sustained significant casualties while engaged in bomb disposal operations. This mortality rate was far higher than other high risk occupations such as deep sea diving, and a careful review was made of how men were selected for EOD operations. The review recommended bringing in psychometric testing of soldiers to ensure those chosen had the correct mental preparation for high risk bomb disposal duties.  The IRA came up with ever more sophisticated designs and deployments of IEDs. Booby Trap or Victim Operated IEDs (VOIEDs), became commonplace. The IRA engaged in an ongoing battle to gain the upper hand in electronic warfare with remote controlled devices. The rapid changes in development led 321 EOD to employ specialists from DERA (now Dstl, an agency of the MOD), the Royal Signals, and Military Intelligence. This approach by the British army to fighting the IRA in Northern Ireland led to the development and use of most of the modern weapons, equipment and techniques now used by EOD Operators throughout the rest of the world today.  The bomb disposal operations were led by Ammunition Technicians and Ammunition Technical Officers from 321 EOD, and were trained at the Felix Centre at the Army School of Ammunition.  IEDs have been used in many attacks by Palestinian militants and continue to be used in recent attacks.[95]  The Lebanese National Resistance Front, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, other resistance groups in Lebanon, and later Hezbollah, made extensive use of IEDs to resist Israeli forces after Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982. Israel withdrew from Beirut, Northern Lebanon, and Mount Lebanon in 1985, whilst maintaining its occupation of Southern Lebanon. Hezbollah frequently used IEDs to attack Israeli military forces in this area up until the Israeli withdrawal, and the end of the invasion of Lebanon in May 2000.  One such bomb killed Israeli Brigadier General Erez Gerstein[96] on 28 February 1999, the highest-ranking Israeli to die in Lebanon since Yekutiel Adam's death in 1982.  Also in the 2006 War in Lebanon, a Merkava Mark II tank was hit by a pre-positioned Hezbollah IED, killing all 4 IDF servicemen on board,[97] the first of two IEDs to damage a Merkava tank.  Homemade IEDs are used extensively during the post-civil war violence in Libya, mostly in the city of Benghazi against police stations, cars or foreign embassies.[98][99][100]  IEDs were also widely used in the 10-years long civil war of the Maoists in Nepal, ranging from those bought from illicit groups in India and China, to self-made devices. Typically used devices were pressure cooker bombs, socket bombs, pipe bombs, bucket bombs, etc. The devices were used more for the act of terrorizing the urban population rather than for fatal causes, placed in front of governmental offices, street corners or road sides. Mainly, the home-made IEDs were responsible for destruction of majority of structures targeted by the Maoists and assisted greatly in spreading terror among the public.  Boko Haram are using IEDs during their insurgency.[101][102][103][104]  Taliban and other insurgent groups use IEDs against police, military, security forces, and civilian targets.[105][106][107]  IEDs have also been popular in Chechnya, where Russian forces were engaged in fighting with rebel elements.  While no concrete statistics are available on this matter, bombs have accounted for many Russian deaths in both the First Chechen War (1994\u20131996) and the Second (1999\u20132009).  Al Shabaab is using IEDs during the Somali Civil War.[108][109][110][111]  During the Syrian Civil War, militant insurgents were using IEDs to attack buses, cars, trucks, tanks and military convoys.[112][113][114] Additionally, the Syrian Air Force has used barrel bombs to attack targets in cities and other areas. Such barrel bombs consist of barrels filled with high explosives, oil, and shrapnel, and are dropped from helicopters.[115][116]  Along with mines and IEDs, ISIL also used VBIEDs in Syria,[117] including during 2017 Aleppo suicide car bombing. See also: Improvised artillery in the Syrian civil war.  On 16 November 2021, suicide bombers set off two powerful explosions in the center of Uganda's capital Kampala during rush hour in an attack later claimed by Islamic State. There have been a number of bomb explosions in 2021. In October, a 20-year-old waitress was killed after a device, left in a shopping bag, detonated in a bar in the city. Days later several people were injured when a suicide bomber blew himself up in a bus near Kampala.[118]  In the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols built an IED with ammonium nitrate fertilizer, nitromethane, and stolen commercial explosives in a rental truck, with sandbags used to concentrate the explosive force in the desired direction. McVeigh detonated it next to the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killing 168 people, 19 of whom were children.  High school students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold used multiple IEDs during the Columbine High School massacre on 20 April 1999, including two large propane bombs that were placed in the cafeteria, powerful enough to kill or injure everyone inside the room, along with pipe bombs, Molotov cocktails, and also two car bombs, designed to attack first responders and news reporters responding to the initial bombing. Both propane bombs and both car bombs failed to detonate correctly. They then went on to shoot and kill 13 people before committing suicide. If all bombs detonated, there could have been hundreds killed in the massacre, but nobody was injured by any of the explosives during the massacre. The pair had planned to exceed the death count during the Oklahoma City bombing four years earlier.  In January 2011, a shaped pipe bomb was discovered and defused at a Martin Luther King Jr. memorial march in Spokane, Washington. The FBI said that the bomb was specifically designed to cause maximum harm as the explosive device was, according to the Los Angeles Times, packed with fishing weights covered in rat poison, and may have been racially motivated. No one was injured during the event.  On 15 April 2013, as the annual Boston Marathon race was concluding, two bombs were detonated seconds apart close to the finish line. Initial FBI response indicated suspicion of IED pressure cooker bombs.  On 17\u201319 September 2016, several explosions occurred in Manhattan and New Jersey. The sources of the explosions were all found to be IEDs of various types, such as pressure cooker bombs and pipe bombs.  Many IED-related arrests are made each year in circumstances where the plot was foiled before the device was deployed, or the device exploded but no one was injured.[119]  A number of deaths and property damage occurring during gender reveal parties have been caused by the detonation of improvised explosive devices. These include the 2017 Sawmill Fire, which was started by the detonation of a mass of tannerite intended to disperse coloured powder,[120] and an incident in 2019 where an IED similarly designed to release powder exploded in a manner similar to a pipe bomb, killing a 56-year-old woman after shrapnel struck her in the head.[121]  IEDs are in use in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine[122][123] and have also been used there for assassinations.[124]  IEDs were used during the Vietnam War by the Viet Cong against land- and river-borne vehicles as well as personnel.[125] They were commonly constructed using materials from unexploded American ordnance.[126] Thirty-three percent of U.S. casualties in Vietnam and twenty-eight percent of deaths were officially attributed to mines; these figures include losses caused by both IEDs and commercially manufactured mines.[127]  Houthis are using IEDs[128] against Saudi-led coalition and Hadi's forces during Yemeni Civil War (2015\u2013present),[129][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen and Saudi\u2013Yemeni border conflict.[130][131][132][133]  Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and ISIL in Yemen are also known to use IEDs.[134]  The film The Hurt Locker follows an Iraq War Explosive Ordnance Disposal team who are targeted by insurgents and shows their psychological reactions to the stress of combat. "},{"title":"Track and field","content":"  Track and field is a sport that includes athletic contests based on running, jumping, and throwing skills.[1] The name is derived from where the sport takes place, a running track and a grass field for the throwing and some of the jumping events. Track and field is categorized under the umbrella sport of athletics, which also includes road running, cross country running and racewalking. In British English the term \"Athletics\" is synonymous with American \"Track and Field\" and includes all jumping events.  The foot racing events, which include sprints, middle- and long-distance events, racewalking, and hurdling, are won by the athlete who completes it in the least time. The jumping and throwing events are won by those who achieve the greatest distance or height. Regular jumping events include long jump, triple jump, high jump, and pole vault, while the most common throwing events are shot put, javelin, discus, and hammer. There are also \"combined events\" or \"multi events\", such as the pentathlon consisting of five events, heptathlon consisting of seven events, and decathlon consisting of ten events. In these, athletes participate in a combination of track and field events. Most track and field events are individual sports with a single victor; the most prominent team events are relay races, which typically feature teams of four. Events are almost exclusively divided by gender, although both the men's and women's competitions are usually held at the same venue. Recently, \"mixed\" relay events have been introduced into meets, whereby two men and two women make up the four-person team. If a race has too many people to run all at once, preliminary heats will be run to narrow down the field of participants.  Track and field is one of the oldest sports. In ancient times, it was an event held in conjunction with festivals and sports meets such as the Ancient Olympic Games in Greece. In modern times, the two most prestigious international track and field competitions are the athletics competition at the Olympic Games and the World Athletics Championships. World Athletics, formerly known as the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), is the international governing body for the sport of athletics.  Records are kept of the best performances in specific events, at world, continental, and national levels. However, if athletes are deemed to have violated the event's rules or regulations, they are disqualified from the competition and their marks are erased.  In the United States, the term track and field may refer to other athletics events, such as cross country, the marathon, and road running, rather than strictly track-based events.[2]  The sport of track and field has prehistoric roots, being among the oldest of all sporting competitions, as running, jumping and throwing are natural and universal human physical expressions. The first recorded examples of organized track and field events are the Ancient Olympic include further running competitions, but the introduction of the Ancient Olympic pentathlon marked a step towards track and field as it is recognized today\u2014it comprised a five-event competition of the long jump, javelin throw, discus throw, stadion footrace,[3] and wrestling.[4][5]  Track and field events were also present at the Panhellenic Games in Greece around this period, and they spread to Rome in Italy around 201 BC.[6][7] In the Middle Ages, new track and field events began developing in parts of Northern Europe. The stone put and weight throw competitions popular among Celtic societies in Ireland and Scotland were precursors to the modern shot put and hammer throw events. One of the last track and field events to develop was the pole vault, which stemmed from competitions such as fierljeppen in North European Lowlands in the 18th century.  Discrete track and field competitions, separate from general sporting festivals, were first recorded in the 19th century.[8] These were typically organised among rival educational institutions, military organisations and sports clubs.[9] Influenced by a Classics-rich curriculum, competitions in the English public schools were conceived as human equivalents of horse racing, fox hunting and hare coursing. The Royal Shrewsbury School Hunt is the oldest running club in the world, with written records going back to 1831 and evidence that it was established by 1819.[10] The school organised Paper Chase races in which runners followed a trail of paper shreds left by two \"foxes\";[10] even today RSSH runners are called \"hounds\" and a race victory is a \"kill\".[11] The first definite record of Shrewsbury's cross-country Annual Steeplechase is in 1834, making it the oldest running race of the modern era.[10] The school also lays claim to the oldest track and field meeting still extant, the Second Spring Meeting first documented in 1840.[10] This featured a series of throwing and jumping events with mock horse races including the Derby Stakes, the Hurdle Race and the Trial Stakes. Runners were entered by \"owners\" and named as though they were horses.[10] 13 miles (21\u00a0km) away and a decade later, the first Wenlock Olympian Games were held at Much Wenlock racecourse in 1851. It included a \"half-mile foot race\" (805\u00a0m) and a \"leaping in distance\" competition.[12][13]  In 1865, Dr William Penny Brookes of Wenlock helped set up the National Olympian Association, which held their first Olympian Games in 1866 at the Crystal Palace in London.[13] This national event was a great success, attracting a crowd of over ten thousand people.[13] In response, the Amateur Athletic Club was formed that same year and held a championship for \"gentlemen amateurs\" in an attempt to reclaim the sport for the educated elite.[13] Ultimately the \"allcomers\" ethos of the NOA won through and in 1880 the AAC was reconstituted as the Amateur Athletic Association, the first national body for the sport of athletics. The AAA Championships, the de facto British national championships despite being for England only, have been held annually since July 1880 with breaks only during two world wars and 2006\u20132008.[14] The AAA was effectively a global governing body in the early years of the sport, helping to codify its rules.  Meanwhile, the New York Athletic Club in 1876 began holding an annual national competition, the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships.[15] The establishment of general sports governing bodies for the United States (the Amateur Athletic Union in 1888) and France (the Union des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s fran\u00e7aises de sports athl\u00e9tiques in 1889) put the sport on a formal footing and made international competitions possible.  The revival of the Olympic Games at the end of the 19th century marked a new high for track and field. The Olympic athletics programme, comprising track and field events plus a marathon, contained many of the foremost sporting competitions of the 1896 Summer Olympics. The Olympics also consolidated the use of metric measurements in international track and field events, both for race distances and for measuring jumps and throws. The Olympic athletics programme greatly expanded over the next decades, and track and field remained among its most prominent contests. The Olympics was the elite competition for track and field, only open to amateur sportsmen. Track and field continued to be a largely amateur sport, as this rule was strictly enforced: Jim Thorpe was stripped of his track and field medals from the 1912 Olympics after it was revealed that he had taken expense money for playing baseball, violating Olympic amateurism rules. His medals were reinstated 29 years after his death.[16]  That same year, the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) was established as the international governing body for track and field, and it enshrined amateurism as a founding principle for the sport. The National Collegiate Athletic Association held their first Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship in 1921, making it one of the most prestigious competitions for students. In 1923 track and field featured at the inaugural World Student Games.[17] The first continental track and field competition was the 1919 South American Championships, followed by the European Athletics Championships in 1934.[18]  Until the early 1920s, track and field was almost an exclusively male pursuit. Many colleges required women to participate in walking events. Walking was considered to be a primarily female sport. In the late 1800s it was still incredibly rare to find women in the gym, as this was considered a masculine activity. On 9 November 1895, the first women's track meet in the United States was held and it was called \"a field day\".[19] Alice Milliat argued for the inclusion of women at the Olympics, but the International Olympic Committee refused. She founded the International Women's Sports Federation in 1921 and, alongside a growing women's sports movement in Europe and North America, the group initiated of the Women's Olympiad, held annually from 1921 to 1923. In cooperation with the English Women's Amateur Athletic Association (WAAA), the Women's World Games was held four times between 1922 and 1934, as well as a Women's International and British Games in London in 1924. These efforts ultimately led to the introduction of five track and field events for women in the athletics at the 1928 Summer Olympics.[20] National women's events were established in this period, with 1923 seeing the First British Track & Field championships for women and the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) sponsoring the first American Track & Field championships for women. In China, women's track and field events were being held in the 1920s, but were subject to criticism and disrespect from audiences. Physical education advocate Zhang Ruizhen called for greater equality and participation of women in Chinese track and field.[21] The rise of Kinue Hitomi and her 1928 Olympic medal for Japan signified the growth of women's track and field in East Asia.[22] More women's events were gradually introduced, though it was only towards the end of the century that the athletics programmes approached gender parity. Marking an increasingly inclusive approach to the sport, major track and field competitions for disabled athletes were first introduced at the 1960 Summer Paralympics.  With the rise of numerous regional championships, and the growth in Olympic-style multi-sport events (such as the Commonwealth Games and Pan-American Games), competitions between international track and field athletes became widespread. From the 1960s onward, the sport gained exposure and commercial appeal through television coverage and the increasing wealth of nations. After over half a century of amateurism, in the late 1970s the amateur status of the sport began to be displaced by professionalism.[9] As a result, the Amateur Athletic Union was dissolved in the US and replaced with a non-amateur body focused on the sport of athletics: The Athletics Congress (later USA Track and Field).[23] The IAAF abandoned amateurism in 1982 and later rebranded itself as the International Association of Athletics Federations.[9] While Western countries were limited to amateurs until the 1980s, the Soviet Bloc always fielded state-funded athletes who trained full-time, putting American and Western European athletes at a significant disadvantage.[24] 1983 saw the establishment of the IAAF World Championships in Athletics, becoming, with the Olympics, one of track and field's most prestigious competitions.  The profile of the sport reached an apogee in the 1980s, with a number of athletes becoming household names, like Carl Lewis, Sergey Bubka, Sebastian Coe, Zola Budd and Florence Griffith Joyner. Many world records were broken then, and the added political element between competitors of the United States, East Germany, and the Soviet Union, during the Cold War, only served to stoke the sport's popularity. The rising commerciality of track and field was also met with developments in sports science, and there were transformations in coaching methods, athlete's diets, training facilities, and sports equipment. The use of performance-enhancing drugs also increased. State-sponsored doping in 1970s and 1980s East Germany, China,[25] the Soviet Union,[26] and early 21st century Russia, as well as prominent individual cases such as those of Olympic gold medallists Ben Johnson and Marion Jones, damaged the public image and marketability of the sport.  From the 1990s onward, track and field became increasingly more professional and international, as the IAAF gained over 200 member nations. The IAAF World Championships in Athletics became a fully professional competition with the introduction of prize money in 1997,[9] and in 1998 the IAAF Golden League\u2014an annual series of major track and field meetings in Europe\u2014raised the economic incentive through its US$1 million jackpot. In 2010, the series was replaced by the more lucrative Diamond League, a fourteen-meeting series held in Europe, Asia, North America, and the Middle East\u2014the first-ever worldwide annual series of track and field meetings.[27]  Track and field events are divided into three categories: track events, field events, and combined events.[28] The majority of athletes tend to specialize in one event type with the aim of perfecting their performances, although the aim of combined events athletes is to become proficient in a number of disciplines. Track events involve running on a track over specified distances, and\u2014in the case of the hurdling and steeplechase events\u2014surmounting obstacles. There are also relay races in which teams of athletes run and pass on a baton to their team members at the end of a certain distance.  There are two types of field events: jumps and throws. In jumping competitions, athletes are judged on either the length or height of the jumps. The performances of jumping events for distance are measured from a board or marker, and overstepping this mark is judged as a foul. In the jumps for height, an athlete must clear their body over a crossbar without knocking the bar off the supporting standards. The majority of jumping events are unaided, although athletes propel themselves vertically with purpose-built sticks in the pole vault.  The throwing events involve hurling an implement (such as a heavyweight, javelin or discus) from a set point, with athletes being judged on the distance that the object is thrown. Combined events involve the same group of athletes contesting a number of different track and field events. Points are given for their performance in each event and the athlete and\/or team with the highest score at the end of all events is the winner.    Races over short distances, or sprints, are among the oldest running competitions. The first 13 editions of the Ancient Olympic Games featured only one event, the stadion race, which was a race from one end of the stadium to the other.[3] Sprinting events are focused on athletes reaching and sustaining their quickest possible running speed. Three sprinting events are currently held at the Olympics and outdoor World Championships: the 100, 200, and 400 metres. These events have their roots in races of imperial measurements that later changed to metric: the 100 metres evolved from the 100-yard dash,[29] the 200\u00a0m distances came from the furlong (or 1\/8 of a mile),[30] and the 400\u00a0m was the successor to the 440 yard dash or quarter-mile race.[31]  At the professional level, sprinters begin the race by assuming a crouching position in the starting blocks before leaning forward and gradually moving into an upright position as the race progresses and momentum is gained.[32] Athletes remain in the same lane on the running track throughout all sprinting events,[31] with the sole exception of the 400\u00a0m indoors. Races up to 100\u00a0m are largely focused upon acceleration to an athlete's maximum speed.[32] All sprints beyond this distance increasingly incorporate an element of endurance.[33] Human physiology dictates that a runner's near-top speed cannot be maintained for more than thirty seconds or so because lactic acid builds up once leg muscles begin to suffer oxygen deprivation.[31]  Top speed can only be maintained for up to 20\u00a0metres.[34]  The 60 metres is a common indoor event and indoor world championship event. Less-common events include the 50, 55, 300, and 500 metres, which are run in some high school and collegiate competitions in the United States. The 150 metres, though rarely competed, has a star-studded history: Pietro Mennea set a world best in 1983,[35] Olympic champions Michael Johnson and Donovan Bailey went head-to-head over the distance in 1997,[36] and Usain Bolt improved Mennea's record in 2009.[35]  The most common middle-distance track events are the 800 metres, 1500 metres and mile run, although the 3000 metres may also be classified as a middle-distance event.[37] The 880 yard run, or half mile, was the forebear of the 800\u00a0m distance and it has its roots in competitions in the United Kingdom in the 1830s.[38] The 1500\u00a0m came about as a result of running three laps of a 500\u00a0m track, which was commonplace in continental Europe in the 20th century.[39]  Middle distance events can begin in one of two ways: a staggered start or a waterfall start. In the 800 meter race, athletes begin in individual lanes that are staggered before the turn.[40] Runners must remain in their lanes for the first 100\u00a0m before cutting in to run as a pack.[41] This rule was introduced to reduce jostling between runners in the early stages of the race.[38] The 1500 meter and longer events typically use a waterfall start, where runners start the race from a standing position along a curved starting line and then immediately cut in towards the innermost track to follow the quickest route to the finish.[42] Physiologically, middle-distance events demand that athletes have good aerobic and anaerobic energy producing systems, and also that they have strong endurance.[43]  The 1500\u00a0m and mile run events have historically been some of the most prestigious track and field events. Swedish rivals Gunder H\u00e4gg and Arne Andersson broke each other's 1500\u00a0m and mile world records on a number of occasions in the 1940s.[44][45] The prominence of the distances were maintained by Roger Bannister, who in 1954 was the first to run the long-elusive four-minute mile,[46][47] and Jim Ryun's exploits served to popularise interval training.[39] Races between British rivals Sebastian Coe, Steve Ovett and Steve Cram characterised middle-distance running in the 1980s.[48] From the 1990s onward, North Africans such as Noureddine Morceli of Algeria and Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco came to dominate the 1500 and mile events.[39]  Beyond the short distances of sprinting events, factors such as an athlete's reactions and top speed becomes less important, while qualities such as pace, tactics and endurance become more so.[38][39]  There are three common long-distance running events in track and field competitions: 3000, 5000, and 10,000 metres. The latter two races are both Olympic and World Championship events outdoors, while the 3000\u00a0m is held at the IAAF World Indoor Championships. The 5000\u00a0m and 10,000\u00a0m events have their historical roots in the 3-mile and 6-mile races. The 3000\u00a0m was used as a women's long-distance event, entering the World Championship programme in 1983 and Olympic programme in 1984, but this was abandoned in favour of a women's 5000\u00a0m event in 1995.[49] Marathons, while long-distance races, are typically run on street courses, and often are run separately from other track and field events.  In terms of competition rules and physical demands, long-distance track races have much in common with middle-distance races, except that pacing, stamina, and tactics become much greater factors in performances.[50][51] A number of athletes have achieved success in both middle- and long-distance events, including Sa\u00efd Aouita who set world records from 1500\u00a0m to 5000\u00a0m.[52] The use of pace-setters in long-distance events is very common at the elite level, although they are not present at championship level competitions as all qualified competitors want to win.[51][53]  Long-distance track events gained popularity in the 1920s by the achievements of the \"Flying Finns\", such as multiple Olympic champion Paavo Nurmi. The successes of Emil Z\u00e1topek in the 1950s promoted intense interval training methods, but Ron Clarke's record-breaking feats established the importance of natural training and even-paced running. The 1990s saw the rise of North and East African runners in long-distance events. Kenyans and Ethiopians, in particular, have since remained dominant in these events.[49]  Relay races are the only track and field event in which a team of runners directly compete against other teams.[54] Typically, a team is made up of four runners of the same sex. Each runner completes their specified distance (referred to as a leg) before handing over a baton to a teammate, who then begins their leg. There is usually a designated area where athletes must exchange the baton. Teams may be disqualified if they fail to complete the change within the area, or if the baton is dropped during the race. A team may also be disqualified if its runners are deemed to have wilfully impeded other competitors.  Relay races emerged in the United States in the 1880s as a variation on charity races between firemen, who would hand a red pennant on to teammates every 300\u00a0yards. Two very common relay events are the 4\u00d7100 metres relay and the 4\u00d7400 metres relay. Both entered the Olympic programme at the 1912 Summer Games after a one-off men's medley relay featured in 1908 Olympics.[55] The 4\u00d7100\u00a0m event is run strictly within the same lane on the track, meaning that the team collectively runs one complete circuit of the track. Teams in a 4\u00d7400\u00a0m event remain in their own lane until the runner of the second leg passes the first bend, at which point runners can leave their lanes and head towards the inmost part of the circuit. For the second and third baton changeovers, teammates must align themselves in respect of their team position \u2013 leading teams take the inner lanes while members of slower teams must await the baton on outer lanes.[54][56]  In a shuttle hurdle relay, each of four hurdlers on a team runs the opposite direction from the preceding runner. No batons are used.  The IAAF keeps world records for five different types of track relays. As with 4\u00d7100\u00a0m and 4\u00d7400\u00a0m events, all races comprise teams of four athletes running the same distances, with the less commonly contested distances being the 4\u00d7200\u00a0m, 4\u00d7800\u00a0m and 4\u00d71500\u00a0m relays.[57] Other events include the distance medley relay (comprising legs of 1200, 400, 800, and 1600 metres), which is frequently held in the United States, and a sprint relay, known as the Swedish medley relay, which is popular in Scandinavia and was held at the IAAF World Youth Championships in Athletics programme.[58] Relay events have significant participation in the United States, where a number of large meetings (or relay carnivals) are focused almost solely on relay events.[59]  Races with hurdles as obstacles were first popularised in the 19th century in England.[60] The first known event, held in 1830, was a variation of the 100-yard dash that included heavy wooden barriers as obstacles. A competition between the Oxford and Cambridge Athletic Clubs in 1864 refined this, holding a 120-yard race (110\u00a0m) with ten hurdles of 3-foot and 6\u00a0inches (1.06\u00a0m) in height (each placed 10 yards (9\u00a0m) apart), with the first and final hurdles 15 yards from the start and finish, respectively. French organisers adapted the race into metric (adding 28\u00a0cm) and the basics of this race, the men's 110 metres hurdles, has changed little.[61] The origin of the 400 metres hurdles also lies in Oxford, where around 1860 a competition was held over 440\u00a0yards and twelve 1.06\u00a0m high wooden barriers were placed along the course. The modern regulations stem from the 1900 Summer Olympics: the distance was fixed to 400\u00a0m while ten 3-foot (91.44\u00a0cm) hurdles were placed 35\u00a0m apart on the track, with the first and final hurdles being 45\u00a0m and 40\u00a0m away from the start and finish, respectively.[62] Women's hurdles are slightly lower at 84\u00a0cm (2\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in) for the 100\u00a0m event and 76\u00a0cm (2\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in) for the 400\u00a0m event.[61][62]  The most common events are the 100 metres hurdles for women, 110\u00a0m hurdles for men and 400\u00a0m hurdles for both sexes. The men's 110\u00a0m has been featured at every modern Summer Olympics while the men's 400\u00a0m was introduced in the second edition of the Games.[61][62] Women's initially competed in the 80 metres hurdles event, which entered the Olympic programme in 1932. This was extended to the 100\u00a0m hurdles at the 1972 Olympics,[61] but it was not until 1984 that a women's 400\u00a0m hurdles event took place at the Olympics (having been introduced at the 1983 World Championships in Athletics the previous year).[62]  Other distances and heights of hurdles, such as the 200 metres hurdles and low hurdles, were once common but are now held infrequently. The 300 metres hurdles is run in some levels of American competition.  Outside of the hurdles events, the steeplechase race is the other track and field event with obstacles. Just as the hurdling events, the steeplechase finds its origin in student competition in Oxford, England. However, this event was born as a human variation on the original steeplechase competition found in horse racing. A steeplechase event was held on a track for the 1879 English championships and the 1900 Summer Olympics featured men's 2500\u00a0m and 4000\u00a0m steeplechase races. The event was held over various distances until the 1920 Summer Olympics marked the rise of the 3000 metres steeplechase as the standard event.[63] The IAAF set the standards of the event in 1954, and the event is held on a 400\u00a0m circuit that includes a water jump on each lap.[64] Despite the long history of men's steeplechase in track and field, the women's steeplechase only gained World Championship status in 2005, with its first Olympic appearance in 2008.  The long jump is one of the oldest track and field events, having its roots as one of the events within the ancient Greek pentathlon contest. The athletes would take a short run up and jump into an area of dug up earth, with the winner being the one who jumped farthest.[65] Small weights (Halteres) were held in each hand during the jump then swung back and dropped near the end to gain extra momentum and distance.[66] The modern long jump, standardised in England and the United States around 1860, bears resemblance to the ancient event although no weights are used. Athletes sprint along a length of track that leads to a jumping board and a sandpit.[67] The athletes must jump before a marked line and their achieved distance is measured from the nearest point of sand disturbed by the athlete's body.[68]  The athletics competition at the first Olympics featured a men's long jump competition and a women's competition was introduced at the 1948 Summer Olympics.[67] Professional long jumpers typically have strong acceleration and sprinting abilities. However, athletes must also have a consistent stride to allow them to take off near the board while still maintaining their maximum speed.[68][69] In addition to the traditional long jump, a standing long jump contest exists which requires that athletes leap from a static position without a run-up. A men's version of this event featured on the Olympic programme from 1900 to 1912.[70]  Similar to the long jump, the triple jump takes place on a track heading towards a sandpit. Originally, athletes would hop on the same leg twice before jumping into the pit, but this was changed to the current \"hop, step and jump\" pattern from 1900 onwards.[71] There is some dispute over whether the triple jump was contested in ancient Greece: while some historians claim that a contest of three jumps occurred at Ancient Games,[71] others such as Stephen G. Miller believe this is incorrect, suggesting that the belief stems from a mythologised account of Phayllus of Croton having jumped 55 ancient feet (around 16.3\u00a0m).[66][72] The Book of Leinster, a 12th-century Irish manuscript, records the existence of geal-ruith (triple jump) contests at the Tailteann Games.[73]  The men's triple jump competition has been ever-present at the modern Olympics, but it was not until 1993 that a women's version gained World Championship status and went on to have its first Olympic appearance three years later.[71] The men's standing triple jump event featured at the Olympics in 1900 and 1904, but such competitions have since become very uncommon, although it is still used as a non-competitive exercise drill.[74] The Current world record for the Men's triple jump is 18.29 meter (60\u00a0ft 0in) held by Jonathan Edwards. The current women's world record is 15.67 meters (51\u00a0ft 4 3\/4in) held by Yulimar Rojas.  The first recorded instances of high jumping competitions were in Scotland in the 19th century.[75] Further competitions were organised in 1840 in England and in 1865 the basic rules of the modern event were standardised there.[76] Athletes have a short run up and then take off from one foot to jump over a horizontal bar and fall back onto a cushioned landing area.[77] The men's high jump was included in the 1896 Olympics and a women's competition followed in 1928.  Jumping technique has played a significant part in the history of the event. High jumpers typically cleared the bar feet first in the late 19th century, using either the Scissors, Eastern cut-off or Western roll technique. The straddle technique became prominent in the mid-20th century, but Dick Fosbury overturned tradition by pioneering a backwards and head-first technique in the late 1960s \u2013 the Fosbury Flop \u2013 which won him the gold at the 1968 Olympics. This technique has become the overwhelming standard for the sport from the 1980s onwards.[76][78] The standing high jump was contested at the Olympics from 1900 to 1912, but is now relatively uncommon outside of its use as an exercise drill.  In terms of sport, the use of poles for vaulting distances was recorded in Fierljeppen contests in the Frisian area of Europe, and vaulting for height was seen at gymnastics competitions in Germany in the 1770s.[79] One of the earliest recorded pole vault competitions was in Cumbria, England in 1843.[80] The basic rules and technique of the event originated in the United States. The rules required that athletes do not move their hands along the pole and athletes began clearing the bar with their feet first and twisting so that the stomach faces the bar. Bamboo poles were introduced in the 20th century and a metal box in the runway for planting the pole became standard. Landing mattresses were introduced in the mid-20th century to protect the athletes who were clearing increasingly greater heights.[79]  The modern event sees athletes run down a strip of track, plant the pole in the metal box, and vault over the horizontal bar before letting go of the pole and falling backwards onto the landing mattress.[81] While earlier versions used wooden, metal or bamboo, modern poles are generally made from artificial materials such as fibreglass or carbon fibre.[82] The pole vault has been an Olympic event since 1896 for men, but it was over 100 years later that the first women's world championship competition was held at the 1997 IAAF World Indoor Championships. The first women's Olympic pole vaulting competition occurred in 2000.[79]  Track and field contains some of the foremost kinds of throwing sports, and the four major disciplines are the only pure throwing events to feature at the Olympic Games.[83]  The genesis of the shot put can be traced to pre-historic competitions with rocks:[84] in the Middle Ages the stone put was known in Scotland and the steinstossen was recorded in Switzerland. In the 17th century, cannonball throwing competitions within the English military provided a precursor to the modern sport.[85] The term \"shot\" originates from the use of round shot-style ammunition for the sport.[86] The modern rules were first laid out in 1860 and required that competitors take legal throws within a square throwing area of seven feet (2.13\u00a0m) on each side. This was amended to a circle area with a seven-foot diameter in 1906, and the weight of the shot was standardised to 16\u00a0pounds (7.26\u00a0kg). Throwing technique was also refined over this period, with bent arm throws being banned as they were deemed too dangerous and the side-step and throw technique arising in the United States in 1876.[85]  The shot put has been an Olympic sport for men since 1896 and a women's competition using a 4\u00a0kg (8.82\u00a0lb) shot was added in 1948. Further throwing techniques have arisen since the post-war era: in the 1950s Parry O'Brien popularised the 180 degree turn and throw technique commonly known as the \"glide\", breaking the world record 17 times along the way, while Aleksandr Baryshnikov and Brian Oldfield introduced the \"spin\" or rotational technique in 1976.[85][87]  In the discus throw, athletes compete to throw a heavy disc the farthest. In standard competitions, athletes throw the disc from a set circular arc and take turns in a series of throw, with the singular best effort deciding the victor. As one of the events within the ancient pentathlon, the history of the discus throw dates back to 708 BC.[88] In ancient times a heavy circular disc was thrown from a set standing position on a small pedestal, and it was this style that was revived for the 1896 Olympics.[89] This continued until the 1906 Intercalated Games in Athens, which featured both the ancient style and the increasingly popular modern style of turning and throwing. By the 1912 Olympics, the ancient standing throw style had fallen into disuse and contests starting within a 2.5\u00a0m squared throwing area became the standard.[90] The discus implement was standardised to 2\u00a0kg (4.4\u00a0pounds) in weight and 22\u00a0cm (8\u00a0inches) in diameter in 1907.[89] The women's discus was among the first women's events on the Olympic programme, being introduced in 1928.[91] The first modern athlete to throw the discus while rotating the whole body was Czech athlete Franti\u0161ek Janda-Suk, who invented the technique when studying the position of the famous statue of Discobolus and won the 1900 Olympic silver medal.  As an implement of war and hunting, the javelin throw began in prehistoric times.[92] Along with the discus, the javelin was the second throwing event in the ancient Olympic pentathlon. Records from 708 BC show two javelin competition types co-existing: throwing at a target and throwing the javelin for distance. It was the latter type from which the modern event derives.[93] In ancient competitions, athletes would wrap an ankyle (thin leather strip) around the javelin that acted as a sling to facilitate extra distance.[94] The javelin throw gained much popularity in Scandinavia in the late 19th century and athletes from the region are still among the most dominant throwers in men's competitions.[93] The modern event features a short run up on a track and then the thrower releases the javelin before the foul line. The runway measures at a minimum of 30m in length, and is covered with the same surface as the track.[95]  The first Olympic men's javelin throw contest was held in 1908 and a women's competition was introduced in 1932.[92][96] The first javelins were made of various types of wood, but in the 1950s, former athlete Bud Held introduced a hollow javelin, then a metal javelin, both of which increased throwers performances.[93] Another former athlete, Mikl\u00f3s N\u00e9meth invented the rough-tailed javelin and throws reached in excess of 100\u00a0m \u2013 edging towards the limits of stadia.[97] The distances and the increasing number of horizontal landings led the IAAF to redesign the men's javelin to reduce distance and increase the implement's downward pitching moment to allow for easier measurement. Rough-tailed designs were banned in 1991 and all marks achieved with such javelins were removed from the record books. The women's javelin underwent a similar redesign in 1999.[93] The current javelin specifications are 2.6 to 2.7\u00a0m in length and 800\u00a0grams in weight for men, and 2.2 to 2.3\u00a0m and 600\u00a0g for women.[98]  The earliest recorded precursors to the modern hammer throw stem from the Tailteann Games of ancient Ireland, which featured events such as throwing either a weight attached to a rope, a large rock on a wooden handle, or even a chariot wheel on a wooden axle.[99] Other ancient competitions included throwing a cast iron ball attached to a wooden handle \u2013 the root of the term \"hammer throw\" due to their resemblance to the tools.[100] In 16th century England, contests involving the throwing of actual blacksmith's Sledgehammers were recorded.[99] The hammer implement was standardised in 1887 and the competitions began to resemble the modern event. The weight of the metal ball was set at 16\u00a0pounds (7.26\u00a0kg) while the attached wire had to measure between 1.175\u00a0m and 1.215\u00a0m.[100]  The men's hammer throw became an Olympic event in 1900 but the women's event \u2013 using a 4\u00a0kg (8.82\u00a0lb) weight \u2013 was not widely competed until much later, finally featuring on the women's Olympic programme in 2000.[101] The distances thrown by male athletes became greater from the 1950s onwards as a result of improved equipment using the denser metals, a switch to concrete throwing areas, and more advanced training techniques.[102] Professional hammer throwers were historically large, strong, sturdy athletes. However, qualities such as refined technique, speed and flexibility have become increasingly important in the modern era as the legal throwing area has been reduced from 90 to 34.92 degrees and throwing technique involves three to four controlled rotations.[100][103][104]  Combined (or multi-discipline) events are competitions in which athletes participate in a number of track and field events, earning points for their performance in each event, which adds to a total points score. Outdoors, the most common combined events are the men's decathlon (ten events) and the women's heptathlon (seven events). Due to stadium limitations, indoor combined events competition have a reduced number of events, resulting in the men's heptathlon and the women's pentathlon. Athletes are allocated points based on an international-standard points scoring system, such as the decathlon scoring table.  The Ancient Olympic pentathlon (comprising long jump, javelin, discus, the stadion race and wrestling) was a precursor to the track and field combined events and this ancient event was restored at the 1906 Summer Olympics (Intercalated Games). A men's all-around was held at the 1904 Summer Olympics, contested between five American and two British athletes.  The term track and field is intertwined with the stadiums that first hosted such competitions. The two basic features of a track and field stadium are the outer oval-shaped running track and an area of turf within this track\u2014the field. In earlier competitions, track lengths varied: the Panathinaiko Stadium measured 333.33\u00a0metres at the 1896 Summer Olympics, while at the 1904 Olympics the distance was a third of a mile (536.45\u00a0m) at Francis Field. As the sport developed, the IAAF standardised the length to 400\u00a0m and stated that the tracks must be split into six to eight running lanes. Precise widths for the lanes were established, as were regulations regarding the curvature of the track. Tracks made of flattened cinders were popular in the early 20th century but synthetic tracks became standard in the late 1960s. 3M's Tartan track (an all-weather running track of polyurethane) gained popularity after its use at the 1968 US Olympic Trials and the 1968 Summer Olympics and it began the process in which synthetic tracks became the standard for the sport. Many track and field stadiums are multi-purpose stadiums, with the running track surrounding a field built for other sports, such as the various types of football.  The field of the stadium combines a number of elements for use in the jumping and throwing events. The long jump and triple jump areas comprise a straight, narrow 40-metre running track with a sandpit at one or both ends. Jumps are measured from a take off board\u2014typically a small strip of wood with a plasticine marker attached\u2014which ensures athletes jump from behind the measurement line. The pole vault area is also a 40-metre running track and has an indentation in the ground (the box) where vaulters plant their poles to propel themselves over a crossbar before falling onto cushioned landing mats. The high jump is a stripped-down version of this, with an open area of track or field that leads to a crossbar with a square area of landing mats behind it.  The four throwing events generally all begin on one side of the stadium. The javelin throw typically takes place on a piece of track that is central and parallel to the straights of the main running track. The javelin throwing area is a sector shape frequently across the Pitch (sports field) in the middle of the stadium, ensuring that the javelin has a minimal chance of causing damage or injury. The discus throw and hammer throw contests begin in a tall metal cage usually situated in one of the corners of the field. The cage reduces the danger of implements being thrown out of the field of play and throws travel diagonally across the field in the centre of the stadium. The shot put features a circular throwing area with a toe board at one end. The throwing area is a sector. Some stadia also have a water jump area on one side of the field specifically for steeplechase races.  Basic indoor venues may be adapted gymnasiums, which can easily accommodate high jump competitions and short track events. Full-size indoor arenas (i.e. those fully equipped to host all events for the World Indoor Championships) bear similarities with their outdoor equivalents. Typically, a central area is surrounded by a 200-metre oval track with four to eight lanes. The track can be banked at the turns to allow athletes to run around the radius more comfortably. Some have a second running track going straight across the field area, parallel to the straights of the main circuit. This track is used for the 60 metres and 60 metres hurdles events, which are held almost exclusively indoors.  Another common adaptation in the United States is a 160-yard track (11 laps to a mile; 148m) that fits into a common basketball court-sized arena. This was quite popular when races were held at imperial distances, which gradually was phased out by different organizations in the 1970s and 1980s. Examples of this configuration include the Millrose Games at Madison Square Garden, and the Sunkist Invitational formerly held in the Los Angeles Sports Arena.[105]  All four of the common jumping events are held at indoor venues. The long and triple jump areas run alongside the central 60\u00a0m track and are mostly identical in form to their outdoor counterparts. The pole vault track and landing area are also alongside the central running track. Shot put and weight throw are the only throwing events held indoors due to size restrictions. The throwing area is similar to the outdoor event, but the landing sector is a rectangular section surrounded by netting or a stop barrier.[106]  In addition to hosting the World Indoor Championships, the IAAF has hosted the IAAF World Indoor Tour since 2016.  In May 2023, World Athletics announced they were renaming \"indoor track\" and \"indoor athletics\" to \"short track\", effectively expanding the \"indoor track\" category to allow for the theoretical possibility of an outdoor 200 meter-track being used for valid \"indoor\" qualification marks. The change took effect at the beginning of 2024.[107]  Various events have been discontinued from the World Athletics Indoor Championships, including 200m and racewalking. Some race distance events have been held in world tour (IAAF World Indoor Tour and IAAF Indoor Permit Meetings in 1997 or later) events, including at Aviva Indoor Grand Prix and the Russian Winter Meeting, but never at the world championships, including:  The rules of track events in athletics as observed in most international athletics competitions are set by the Competition Rules of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). The most recent complete set of rules is the 2009 rules that relate only to competitions in 2009.[108] Key rules of track events are those regarding starting, running and finishing. Current World Athletics (WA) Rules are available on WA's website [1]. Current USATF (USA) Competition Rules booklet is available on the USATF website [2]. Prior USATF Competition Rules booklets are also available (2002, 2006 to 2020) [3].  The start of a race is marked by a white line 5\u00a0cm wide. In all races that are not run in lanes the start line must be curved, so that all the athletes start the same distance from the finish.[109] Starting blocks may be used for all races up to and including 400 m (including the first leg of the 4 \u00d7 100 m and 4 \u00d7 400 m) and may not be used for any other race. No part of the starting block may overlap the start line or extend into another lane.[110]  All races must be started by the report of the starter's gun or approved starting apparatus fired upwards after they have ascertained that athletes are steady and in the correct starting position.[111] An athlete may not touch either the start line or the ground in front of it with their hands or feet when on their marks.[112]  For sprint races up to 400\u00a0m, the starter gives two commands: \"on your marks\" to instruct athletes to approach the start line, followed by \"set\" to advise the athletes that the start of the race is imminent. The commands of the starter are typically given in the native language in national competitions, or in English or French in international competitions. Once all athletes are set in their starting position, the gun or an approved starting apparatus must be fired or activated. If the starter is not satisfied that all are ready to proceed, the athletes may be called out of the blocks and the process started over.[112]  There are different types of starts for races of different distances. Middle- and long-distance races mainly use the waterfall start. This is when all athletes begin on a curved line that moves farther out at the outer edge of the track. Competitors are allowed to move towards the inside lane right away, as long as it is safe to do so. For some middle-distance races, such as 800\u00a0m, each athlete starts in their own lane. Once the gun fires, they must run in the lane they began in until they reach a set of cones on the track that signal that they can cut in and move towards the inside lane. For sprint races, athletes begin in start blocks and must stay in their own lane for the entire race.[108]  An athlete, after assuming a final set position, may not commence his starting motion until after receiving the report of the gun, or approved starting apparatus. If, in the judgment of the starter or recallers, he does so any earlier, it is considered a false start. It is deemed a false start if, in the judgment of the starter an athlete fails to comply with the commands \"on your marks\" or \"set\" as appropriate after a reasonable time; or an athlete after the command \"on your marks\" disturbs other athletes in the race through sound or otherwise. If the runner is in the \"set\" position and moves, then the runner is also disqualified.[113] As of 2010[update], any athlete making a false start is disqualified.[114]  In International elite competition, electronically tethered starting blocks sense the reaction time of the athletes. If the athlete reacts in less than 0.1 second, an alert sounds for a recall starter and the offending athlete is guilty of a false start.[111] Since 2009, the offending athletes are immediately disqualified.[115]  For sprinting events, except the 4 \u00d7 400\u00a0m relay and the indoor 400\u00a0metres, each athlete must run the race within their allocated lane from start to finish. If an athlete leaves their lane or steps on the line demarking each lane the athlete will be disqualified. Lane rules also apply for initial periods of other track races, for example, the beginning of the 800\u00a0m. Similar rules apply for longer distance races when a large field of athletes is present and separate starting points are designated, with the field merging into one group shortly after the starting phase.[116][117]  Any athlete who jostles or obstructs another athlete, in a way that impedes his progress, should be disqualified from that event. However, if an athlete is pushed or forced by another person to run outside his lane, and if no material advantage is gained, the athlete should not be disqualified.[116][117]  The finish of a race is marked by a white line 5\u00a0cm wide.[118] The finishing position of athletes is determined by the order in which any part of their torso (as distinguished from the head, neck, arms, legs, hands or feet) reaches the vertical plane of the nearer edge of the finish line.[119] Fully automatic timing systems (photo timing) are becoming more and more common at increasingly lower levels of track meets, improving the accuracy, while eliminating the need for eagle-eyed officials on the finish line. Fully automatic timing (FAT) is required for high level meets and any time a sprint record is set (though distance records can be accepted if timed by three independent stopwatches).[108]  With the accuracy of the timing systems, ties are rare. Ties between different athletes are resolved as follows: In determining whether there has been a tie in any round for a qualifying position for the next round based on time, a judge (called the chief photo finish judge) must consider the actual time recorded by the athletes to one thousandth of a second. If the judge decides that there has been a tie, the tying athletes must be placed in the next round or, if that is not practicable, lots must be drawn to determine who must be placed in the next round. In the case of a tie for first place in any final, the referee decides whether it is practicable to arrange for the athletes so tying to compete again. If he decides it is not, the result stands. Ties in other placings remain.[108]  In general, most field events allow a competitor to take their attempt individually, under theoretically the same conditions as the other competitors in the competition. Each attempt is measured to determine who achieved the greatest distance.[108]  Vertical jumps (high jump and pole vault) set a bar at a particular height. The competitor must clear the bar without knocking it off the standards that are holding the bar (flat). Three failures in a row ends the competitor's participation in the event. The competitor has the option to PASS their attempt, which can be used to strategic advantage (of course that advantage is lost if the competitor misses). A pass could be used to save energy and avoid taking a jump that would not improve their position in the standings. After all competitors have either cleared, passed or failed their attempts at a height, the bar goes up. The amount the bar goes up is predetermined before the competition, though when one competitor remains, that competitor may choose their own heights for the remaining attempts. A record is kept of each attempt by each competitor. After all competitors have taken their attempts, the one jumping the highest is the winner, and so on down the other competitors in the event. Ties are broken by first, the number of attempts taken at the highest height (fewest wins), and then if still tied, by the total number of misses in the competition as a whole. The bar does not go back to a lower height except to break a tie for first place or a qualifying position. If those critical positions are still tied after applying the tiebreakers, all tied competitors take a fourth jump at the last height. If they still miss, the bar goes down one increment where they again jump. This process continues until the tie is broken.[108]  Horizontal jumps (long jump and triple jump) and all throws must be initiated behind a line. In the case of horizontal jumps, that line is a straight line perpendicular to the runway. In the case of throws, that line is an arc or a circle. Crossing the line while initiating the attempt invalidates the attempt\u2014it becomes a foul. All landings must occur in a sector. For the jumps, that is a sand filled pit, for throws it is a defined sector. A throw landing on the line on the edge of sector is a foul (the inside edge of the line is the outside edge of the sector). Assuming a proper attempt, officials measure the distance from the closest landing point back to the line. The measuring tape is carefully straightened to the shortest distance between the point and the line. To accomplish this, the tape must be perfectly perpendicular to the take off line in jumps, or is pulled through the center point of the arc for throws. The officials at the landing end of the tape have the zero, while the officials at the point of initiation measure and record the length. Whenever a record (or potential record) occurs, that measurement is taken (again) with a steel tape, and observed by at least three officials (plus usually the meet referee). Steel tapes are easily bent and damaged, so are not used to measure everyday competitions. For major competitions, each competitor gets three tries. The top competitors (usually 8 or 9 depending on that competition's rules or the number of lanes on the track) gets three more tries. At that level of competition, the order of competitors for those final three attempts are set\u2014so the competitor in first place at the end of the third round is last, while the last competitor to qualify goes first. Some meets rearrange the competition order again for the final round, so the final attempt is taken by the leader at that point. At other competitions, meet management may choose to limit all competitors to four or three attempts. Whatever the format, all competitors get an equal number of attempts.[108]  Track and Field athles wear special shoes with spikes, known as track spikes or simply spikes.  Men and women have different weights for their throwing implements \u2013 men's javelin is 800 grams compared to 600 for women, men's weight throw is 35 pounds compared to 20 for women, men's discus is 2 kilograms to women's 1, men's shot put is 16 pounds compared to 8 pounds for women, and men's hammer throw is also 16 pounds to the women's 8. Additionally, men's high hurdles are at height of 42 inches compared to women's hurdles which are 33 inches. For the intermediate hurdles (400 meter hurdles), the men's hurdle height is 36 inches compared to 30 inches for women.  The international governance of track and field falls under the jurisdiction of athletics organisations. World Athletics is the global governing body for track and field, and athletics as a whole. The governance of track and field at continental and national level is also done by athletics bodies. Some national federations are named after the sport, including USA Track & Field and the Philippine Amateur Track & Field Association, but these organisations govern more than just track and field and are in fact athletics governing bodies.[120][121] These national federations regulate sub-national and local track and field clubs, as well as other types of running clubs.[122]  The major global track and field competitions are both held under the scope of athletics. Track and field contests make up the majority of events on the Olympic and Paralympic athletics programmes, which occur every four years. Track and field events have held a prominent position at the Summer Olympics since its inception in 1896,[123] and the events are typically held in the main stadium of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Events such as the 100 metres receive some of the highest levels of media coverage of any Olympic or Paralympic sporting event.  The other two major international competition for track and field are organised by the IAAF. The IAAF had selected the Olympic competition as its world championship event in 1913, but a separate world championships for athletics alone was first held in 1983 \u2013 the IAAF World Championships in Athletics. The championships comprised track and field competitions plus the marathon and racewalking competitions. Initially, this worked on a quadrennial basis but, after 1991, it changed to a biennial format. In terms of indoor track and field, the IAAF World Indoor Championships has been held every two years since 1985 and this is the only world championships that consists of solely track and field events.  Similar to the event programmes at the Olympics, Paralympics and World Championships, track and field forms a significant part of continental championships. The South American Championships in Athletics, created in 1919,[124] was the first continental championships and the European Athletics Championships became the second championships of this type in 1934.[125] The Asian Athletics Championships and African Championships in Athletics were created in the 1970s and Oceania started its championships in 1990.  There are also indoor continental competitions in Europe (European Athletics Indoor Championships) and Asia (Asian Indoor Athletics Championships). There has not been a consistent championships for all of North America, which may be (in part) due to the success of both the Central American and Caribbean Championships and the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships. Most countries have a national championship in track and field and, for athletes, these often play a role in gaining selection into major competitions. Some countries hold many track and field championships at high school and college-level, which help develop younger athletes. Some of these have gained significant exposure and prestige, such as the NCAA Track and Field Championship in the United States and the Jamaican High School Championships.[126] However, the number and status of such competitions significantly vary from country to country.  Mirroring the role that track and field events have at the Summer Olympics and Paralympics, the sport is featured within the athletics programmes of many major multi-sport events. Among some of the first of these events to follow the Olympic-style model were the World University Games in 1923, the Commonwealth Games in 1930, and the Maccabiah Games in 1932.[127] The number of major multi-sport events greatly increased during the 20th century and thus did the number of track and field events held within them. Typically, track and field events are hosted at the main stadium of the games.  After the Olympic and Paralympic Games, the most prominent events for track and field athletes include the three IOC-sanctioned continental games: the All-Africa Games, Asian Games, and the Pan American Games. Other games such as the Commonwealth Games and Summer Universiade, and World Masters Games have significant participation from track and field athletes. Track and field is also present at the national games level, with competitions such as the Chinese National Games serving as the most prestigious national competition for domestic track and field athletes.  One-day track and field meetings form the most common and seasonal aspect of the sport \u2013 they are the most basic level of track and field competition. Meetings are generally organised annually either under the patronage of an educational institution or sports club, or by a group or business that serves as the meeting promoter. In the case of the former, athletes are selected to represent their club or institution. In the case of privately run or independent meetings, athletes participate on an invitation-only basis.[128]  The most basic type of meetings are all-comers track meets, which are largely small, local, informal competitions that allow people of all ages and abilities to compete. As meetings become more organized they can gain official sanctioning by the local or national association for the sport.[129]  At the professional level, meetings began to offer significant financial incentives for all athletes in the 1990s in Europe with the creation of the Golden Four competition, comprising meetings in Z\u00fcrich, Brussels, Berlin and Oslo. This expanded and received IAAF backing as the IAAF Golden League in 1998,[130] which was later supplemented by the branding of selected meetings worldwide as the IAAF World Athletics Tour. In 2010, the Golden League idea was expanded globally as the Diamond League series and this now forms the top tier of professional one-day track and field meetings.[131]  The IAAF World Rankings system was introduced for the 2018 season. An athlete's position within the ranking will be determined by points scored based on their performance and importance of the competition. The points will be considered for eligibility for the World Athletics Championships and Olympic Games.[132] This system will affect athlete participation, which has typically been determined by national bodies, either through selection panels or national trials events.[133]  Athletes performances are timed or measured at virtually all track and field competitions. Doing so can not only serve as a way of determining the winner in an event, but it can also be used for historical comparison (i.e. a record). A large variety of record types exist and men's and women's performances are recorded separately. The foremost types of records organise athlete's performances by the region they represent\u2014beginning with national records, then continental records, up to the global or world record level. National governing bodies control the national record lists, the area associations organise their respective continental lists, and the IAAF ratifies world records.  The IAAF ratifies track and field world records if they meet their set criteria. The IAAF first published a world records list in 1914, initially for men's events only. There were 53 recognised records in running, hurdling and relay, and 12 field records. World records in women's events began in 1936 as more events were gradually added to the list, but significant changes were made in the late 1970s. First, all records in imperial measurements were abandoned in 1976, with the sole exceptional being the mile run due to the prestige and history of the event. The following year, all world records in sprint events would only be recognised if fully automatic electronic timing was used (as opposed to the traditional hand-timing stopwatch method). In 1981, electronic timing was made compulsory for all world record runs in track and field, with times being recorded to within one hundredth of a second. Two additional types of world record were introduced in 1987: world records for indoor competitions, and world records for junior athletes under 20 years old.[134]  The next most important record type are those achieved at a specific competition. For example, the Olympic records represent the best performances by athletes at the Summer Olympics. All major championships and games have their relevant competition records and a large number of track and field meetings keep a note of their meet records. Other record types include: stadium records, records by age range, records by disability, and records by institution or organisation. Cash bonuses are usually offered to athletes if they break significant records, as doing so can generate greater interest and public attendance in track and field competitions.  Track and field athletes are banned from ingesting or using certain substances by governing bodies for the sport, from the national to the international level. The IAAF's constitution incorporates the World Anti-Doping Code among other anti-doping measures.[135] Practices such as blood doping and the use of anabolic steroids, peptide hormones, stimulants, or diuretics can give athletes a physical competitive advantage in track and field.[136] The use of such substances in track and field is opposed on both ethical and medical grounds. Given that the sport functions by measuring and comparing athletes' performances, performance-enhancing substances create an uneven playing field \u2014 athletes who do not use doping substances have a disadvantage over rivals who do. Medically, the use of banned substances may have an adverse effect upon athletes' health. However, some exemptions are made for athletes who take banned substances for therapeutic use, and athletes are not sanctioned for usage in these cases,[137] such as Kim Collins' failed drug test due to asthma medication.[138]  Athletes have historically been willing to take legal and health risks to improve their performance, with some even stating their willingness to risk their lives, as exemplified by research by Mirkin,[139] Goldman[140] and Connor[141] in researching attitudes to the so-called Goldman dilemma. To prevent use of performance-enhancing substances, athletes must submit to drug tests that are conducted both in and out of competition by anti-doping officials or accredited medical staff.[137] Penalized athletes are susceptible to higher testing upon return to competition. Athletes found to have taken substances on the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned list receive sanctions and may be banned from competition for a period of time that corresponds to the seriousness of the infraction.[142] However, the use of substances not on the prohibited list may also result in sanctions if the substance is deemed similar to a banned substance in either composition or effect. Athletes may also be sanctioned for missing tests, seeking to avoid testing or tampering with results, refusing to submit to testing, through circumstantial evidence, or confession of use.[137]  Doping has played a significant part in the modern history of track and field. State-sponsored doping in East Germany with hormones and anabolic steroids marked the rise of women from East Germany in track and field from the late 1960s to the 1980s. A number of these women, such as Marita Koch, broke world records and were highly successful at international competitions. Some athletes, who were following a doping plan from their teenage years, suffered significant health problems as a result of the regime.[143][144] A similar state-sponsored doping system was developed in the Soviet Union. According to British journalist Andrew Jennings, a KGB colonel stated that the agency's officers had posed as anti-doping authorities from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to undermine doping tests and that Soviet competitors were \"rescued with [these] tremendous efforts\".[145][146] Regarding the 1980 Summer Olympics, a 1989 Australian study said, \"There is hardly a medal winner at the Moscow Games, certainly not a gold medal winner, who is not on one sort of drug or another: usually several kinds. The Moscow Games might as well have been called the Chemists' Games.\"[145] In 2016, The New York Times published an article detailing the use of doping by the Soviets in preparation for the 1984 Olympics.[26] Ben Johnson ran a new world record in the 100\u00a0metres at the 1988 Seoul Olympics but was later banned for using anabolic steroids.[147] In the mid-first decade of the 21st century, the BALCO Scandal eventually resulted in the downfall of prominent sprinters such as Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery, among others, through their usage of banned substances.[148] The revelation state-sponsored doping in Russia led to an international ban on all its athletes in 2016, with Russians having to apply to the IAAF to compete as Authorised Neutral Athletes at events such as the 2016 Summer Olympics and 2017 World Championships in Athletics.[149] Doping has affected countries on all continents and has occurred in individual, team and national settings.  Track and field bears most similarity to the others categorised under the sport of athletics, specifically cross country running, and road forms of racewalking and running. All these forms of racing tend to record finishing times, have strictly defined start and finish points, and are generally individual in nature. Middle- and long-distance runners usually participate in cross country and road events, in addition to the track. Track racewalkers are most typically road specialists as well. It is unusual for track and field athletes outside of these two groups to compete in cross country or road events.  Varieties of strength athletics, such as the World's Strongest Man and highland games, often incorporate forms of footracing, carrying heavy objects, as well as throwing events such as the caber toss and keg toss, which bear similarities to track and field throwing events. "},{"title":"Marathon","content":"  The marathon (from Greek  \u039c\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b8\u03ce\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2) is a long-distance foot race with a distance of 42.195\u00a0km (26\u00a0mi 385\u00a0yd),[1] usually run as a road race, but the distance can be covered on trail routes. The marathon can be completed by running or with a run\/walk strategy. There are also wheelchair divisions. More than 800 marathons are held throughout the world each year, with the vast majority of competitors being recreational athletes, as larger marathons can have tens of thousands of participants.[2]  The marathon was one of the original modern Olympic events in 1896. The distance did not become standardized until 1921. The distance is also included in the World Athletics Championships, which began in 1983. It is the only running road race included in both championship competitions (walking races on the roads are also contested in both).  The name Marathon comes from the legend of Pheidippides, the Greek messenger. The legend states that, while he was taking part in the Battle of Marathon, which took place in August or September 490 BC,[3] he witnessed a Persian vessel changing its course towards Athens as the battle was near a victorious end for the Greek army. He interpreted this as an attempt by the defeated Persians to rush into the city to claim a false victory or simply raid,[4] hence claiming their authority over Greek land. It was said that he ran the entire distance to Athens without stopping, discarding his weapons and even clothes to lose as much weight as possible, and burst into the assembly, exclaiming \"we have won!\", before collapsing and dying.[5]  The account of the run from Marathon to Athens first appeared in Plutarch's On the Glory of Athens in the first century AD, which quoted from Heraclides Ponticus's lost work, giving the runner's name as either Thersipus of Erchius or Eucles.[6] This was the account adopted by Benjamin Haydon for his painting  Eucles Announcing the Victory of Marathon, published as an engraving in 1836 with a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon.[7] Satirist Lucian of Samosata gave one of the earliest accounts similar to the modern version of the story, but its historical veracity is disputed based on its tongue-in-cheek writing and the runner being referred to as Philippides and not Pheidippides.[8][9][full citation needed]  There is debate about the historical accuracy of this legend.[10][11] The Greek historian Herodotus, the main source for the Greco-Persian Wars, mentioned Philippides as the messenger who ran from Athens to Sparta asking for help, and then ran back, a distance of over 240 kilometres (150\u00a0mi) each way.[12] In some Herodotus manuscripts, the name of the runner between Athens and Sparta is given as Philippides. Herodotus makes no mention of a messenger sent from Marathon to Athens, and relates that the main part of the Athenian army, having fought and won the grueling battle, and fearing a naval raid by the Persian fleet against an undefended Athens, marched quickly back from the battle to Athens, arriving the same day.[13]  In 1879, Robert Browning wrote the poem Pheidippides. Browning's poem, his composite story, became part of late 19th century popular culture and was accepted as a historic legend.[14]  Mount Pentelicus stands between Marathon and Athens, which means that Philippides would have had to run around the mountain, either to the north or to the south. The latter and more obvious route is followed by the modern Marathon-Athens highway (EO83\u2013EO54), which follows the lay of the land southwards from Marathon Bay and along the coast, then takes a gentle but protracted climb westwards towards the eastern approach to Athens, between the foothills of Mounts Hymettus and Penteli, and then gently downhill to Athens proper. This route, as it existed when the Olympics were revived in 1896, was approximately 40 kilometres (25\u00a0mi) long. It was the approximate distance originally used for marathon races. However, there have been suggestions that Philippides might have followed another route: a westward climb along the eastern and northern slopes of Mount Penteli to the pass of Dionysos, and then a straight southward downhill path to Athens. This route is slightly shorter, 35 kilometres (22\u00a0mi), but includes a very steep climb over the first 5 kilometres (3.1\u00a0mi).  When the modern Olympics began in 1896, the initiators and organizers were looking for a great popularizing event, recalling the glory of ancient Greece. The idea of a marathon race came from Michel Br\u00e9al, who wanted the event to feature in the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens. This idea was heavily supported by Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympics, as well as by the Greeks.[15] A selection race for the Olympic marathon was held on 22 March 1896 (Gregorian)[a] that was won by Charilaos Vasilakos in 3 hours and 18 minutes.[16] The winner of the first Olympic marathon, on 10 April 1896 (a male-only race), was Spyridon Louis, a Greek water-carrier, in 2 hours 58 minutes and 50 seconds.[17] The marathon of the 2004 Summer Olympics was run on the traditional route from Marathon to Athens, ending at Panathinaiko Stadium, the venue for the 1896 Summer Olympics. That men's marathon was won by Italian Stefano Baldini in 2 hours 10 minutes and 55 seconds, a record time for this route until the non-Olympics Athens Classic Marathon of 2014, when Felix Kandie lowered the course record to 2 hours 10 minutes and 37 seconds.  The women's marathon was introduced at the 1984 Summer Olympics (Los Angeles, US) and was won by Joan Benoit of the United States with a time of 2 hours 24 minutes and 52 seconds.[20]  It has become a tradition for the men's Olympic marathon to be the last event of the athletics calendar, on the final day of the Olympics.[21] For many years the race finished inside the Olympic stadium; however, at the 2012 Summer Olympics (London), the start and finish were on The Mall,[22] and at the 2016 Summer Olympics (Rio de Janeiro), the start and finish were in the Samb\u00f3dromo, the parade area that serves as a spectator mall for Carnival.[23]  Often, the men's marathon medals are awarded during the closing ceremony (including the 2004 games, 2012 games and 2016 games).  The Olympic men's record is 2:06:32, set at the 2008 Summer Olympics by Samuel Kamau Wanjiru of Kenya.[24]  The Olympic women's record is 2:23:07, set at the 2012 Summer Olympics by Tiki Gelana of Ethiopia.[25] The men's London 2012 Summer Olympic marathon winner was Stephen Kiprotich of Uganda (2:08:01). Per capita, the Kalenjin ethnic group of Rift Valley Province in Kenya has produced a highly disproportionate share of marathon and track-and-field winners.[26]  The Boston Marathon began on 19 April 1897, and was inspired by the success of the first marathon competition in the 1896 Summer Olympics. It is the world's oldest annual marathon, and ranks as one of the world's most prestigious road racing events. Its course runs from Hopkinton in southern Middlesex County to Copley Square in Boston. Johnny Hayes' victory at the 1908 Summer Olympics also contributed to the early growth of long-distance running and marathoning in the United States.[27][28] Later that year, races around the holiday season including the Empire City Marathon held on New Year's Day 1909 in Yonkers, New York, marked the early running craze referred to as \"marathon mania\".[29] Following the 1908 Olympics, the first five amateur marathons in New York City were held on days that held special meanings: Thanksgiving Day, the day after Christmas, New Year's Day, Washington's Birthday, and Lincoln's Birthday.[30]  Frank Shorter's victory in the marathon at the 1972 Summer Olympics would spur national enthusiasm for the sport more intensely than that which followed Hayes' win 64 years earlier.[28] In 2014, an estimated 550,600 runners completed a marathon within the United States.[31] This can be compared to 143,000 in 1980. Today marathons are held all around the world on a nearly weekly basis.[32]  For a long time after the Olympic marathon started, there were no long-distance races, such as the marathon, for women. Although a few women, such as Stamata Revithi in 1896, had run the marathon distance, they were not included in any official results.[33][34] Marie-Louise Ledru has been credited as the first woman to complete a marathon, in 1918.[35][36][37] Violet Piercy has been credited as the first woman to be officially timed in a marathon, in 1926.[33]  Arlene Pieper became the first woman to officially finish a marathon in the United States when she completed the Pikes Peak Marathon in Manitou Springs, Colorado, in 1959.[38][39] Kathrine Switzer was the first woman to run the Boston Marathon \"officially\" (with a number), in 1967.[40] However, Switzer's entry, which was accepted through an \"oversight\" in the screening process, was in \"flagrant violation of the rules\", and she was treated as an interloper once the error was discovered.[41] Bobbi Gibb had completed the Boston race unofficially the previous year (1966),[42] and was later recognized by the race organizers as the women's winner for that year, as well as 1967 and 1968.[43]  The length of an Olympic marathon was not precisely fixed at first, but the marathon races in the first few Olympic Games were about 40 kilometres (25\u00a0mi),[44] roughly the distance from Marathon to Athens by the longer, flatter route. The exact length depended on the route established for each venue.  The International Olympic Committee agreed in 1907 that the distance for the 1908 London Olympic marathon would be about 25 miles or 40 kilometers. The organizers decided on a course of 26 miles from the start at Windsor Castle to the royal entrance to the White City Stadium, followed by a lap (586 yards 2 feet; 536 m) of the track, finishing in front of the Royal Box.[45][46] The course was later altered to use a different entrance to the stadium, followed by a partial lap of 385 yards to the same finish.  The modern 42.195\u00a0km (26.219\u00a0mi) standard distance for the marathon was set by the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) in May 1921[47][48][49][50] directly from the length used at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London.  An official IAAF marathon course is 42.195\u00a0km (42\u00a0m tolerance only in excess).[51] Course officials add a short course prevention factor of up to one meter per kilometer to their measurements to reduce the risk of a measuring error producing a length below the minimum distance.  For events governed by IAAF rules, it is mandatory that the route be marked so that all competitors can see the distance covered in kilometers.[1] The rules make no mention of the use of miles. The IAAF will only recognize world records that are established at events that are run under IAAF rules. For major events, it is customary to publish competitors' timings at the midway mark and also at 5\u00a0km splits; marathon runners can be credited with world records for lesser distances recognized by the IAAF (such as 20\u00a0km, 30\u00a0km and so on) if such records are established while the runner is running a marathon, and completes the marathon course.[52]  Annually, more than 800 marathons are organized worldwide.[53] Some of these belong to the Association of International Marathons and Distance Races (AIMS) which has grown since its foundation in 1982 to embrace over 300 member events in 83 countries and territories.[54] The marathons of Berlin, Boston, Chicago, London, New York City and Tokyo form the biennial World Marathon Majors series, awarding $500,000 annually to the best overall male and female performers in the series.  In 2006, the editors of Runner's World selected a \"World's Top 10 Marathons\",[55] in which the Amsterdam, Honolulu, Paris, Rotterdam, and Stockholm marathons were featured along with the five original World Marathon Majors events (excluding Tokyo). Other notable large marathons include United States Marine Corps Marathon, Los Angeles, and Rome. The Boston Marathon is the world's oldest annual marathon, inspired by the success of the 1896 Olympic marathon and held every year since 1897 to celebrate Patriots' Day, a holiday marking the beginning of the American Revolution, thereby purposely linking Athenian and American struggle for democracy.[56] The oldest annual marathon in Europe is the Ko\u0161ice Peace Marathon, held since 1924 in Ko\u0161ice, Slovakia. The historic Polytechnic Marathon was discontinued in 1996. The Athens Classic Marathon traces the route of the 1896 Olympic course, starting in Marathon on the eastern coast of Attica, site of the Battle of Marathon of 490 BC, and ending at the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens.[57]  The Midnight Sun Marathon is held in Troms\u00f8, Norway at 70 degrees north. Using unofficial and temporary courses, measured by GPS, races of marathon distance are now held at the North Pole, in Antarctica and over desert terrain. Other unusual marathons include the Great Wall Marathon on The Great Wall of China, the Big Five Marathon among the safari wildlife of South Africa, the Great Tibetan Marathon\u00a0\u2013 a marathon in an atmosphere of Tibetan Buddhism at an altitude of 3,500 metres (11,500\u00a0ft), and the Polar Circle Marathon on the permanent ice cap of Greenland.  A few marathons cross international and geographical borders. The Istanbul Marathon is the only marathon where participants run over two continents (Europe and Asia) during the course of a single event.[b] In the Detroit Free Press Marathon, participants cross the US\/Canada border twice.[59] The Niagara Falls International Marathon includes one international border crossing, via the Peace Bridge from Buffalo, New York, United States to Fort Erie, Ontario, Canada. In the Three Countries Marathon\u00a0[de], participants run through Germany, Switzerland and Austria.[60]  On 20 March 2018, an indoor Marathon took place in the Armory in New York City. The 200 m track saw a world record in the women's and men's field. Lindsey Scherf (USA) set the indoor women's world record with 2:40:55. Malcolm Richards (USA) won in 2:19:01 with a male indoor world record.[61]  Many marathons feature a wheelchair division. Typically, those in the wheelchair racing division start their races earlier than their running counterparts.  The first wheelchair marathon was in 1974 in Toledo, Ohio, won by Bob Hall in 2:54.[62][63] Hall competed in the 1975 Boston Marathon and finished in 2:58, inaugurating the introduction of wheelchair divisions into the Boston Marathon.[64][65] From 1977 the race was declared the US National Wheelchair championship.[66] The Boston Marathon awards $10,000 to the winning push-rim athlete.[67] Ernst van Dyk has won the Boston Marathon wheelchair division ten times and holds the world record at 1:18:27, set in Boston in 2004.[68] Jean Driscoll won eight times (seven consecutively) and holds the women's world record at 1:34:22.[69]  The New York City Marathon banned wheelchair entrants in 1977, citing safety concerns, but then voluntarily allowed Bob Hall to compete after the state Division of Human Rights ordered the marathon to show cause.[70][71] The Division ruled in 1979 that the New York City Marathon and New York Road Runners club had to allow wheelchair athletes to compete, and confirmed this at appeal in 1980,[72] but the New York Supreme Court ruled in 1981 that a ban on wheelchair racers was not discriminatory as the marathon was historically a foot race.[73] However, by 1986 14 wheelchair athletes were competing,[74] and an official wheelchair division was added to the marathon in 2000.[67]  Some of the quickest people to complete a wheel-chair marathon include Thomas Geierpichler (Austria) who won gold in men's T52-class marathon (no lower limb function) in 1 hr 49 min 7 sec in Beijing China, on 17 September 2008; and, Heinz Frei (Switzerland) who won the men's T54 marathon (for racers with spinal cord injuries) in a time of 1 hr 20 min and 14 sec in Oita, Japan, 31 October 1999.[75]  World records were not officially recognized by the IAAF, now known as World Athletics, until 1 January 2004; previously, the best times for the marathon were referred to as the 'world best'. Courses must conform to World Athletics standards for a record to be recognized. However, marathon routes still vary greatly in elevation, course, and surface, making exact comparisons impossible. Typically, the fastest times are set over relatively flat courses near sea level, during good weather conditions and with the assistance of pacesetters.[76]  The current world record time for men over the distance is 2 hours and 35 seconds, set in the Chicago Marathon by the late Kelvin Kiptum of Kenya on 8 October 2023.  The world record for women was set by Tigst Assefa of Ethiopia in the Berlin Marathon on 24 September 2023, in 2 hours 11 minutes and 53 seconds. This broke the previous record set by  Brigid Kosgei of Kenya in the Chicago Marathon on 13 October 2019, in 2 hours 14 minutes and 4 seconds who broke the record Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain had set over 16 years earlier at the London Marathon.  The data is correct as of 22\u00a0April\u00a02024[update].[77][78][79][80]  Notes  Fauja Singh, then 100, finished the Toronto Waterfront Marathon, becoming the first centenarian ever to officially complete that distance. Singh, a British citizen, finished the race on 16 October 2011 with a time of 8:11:05.9, making him the oldest marathoner.[114] Because Singh could not produce a birth certificate from rural 1911 Colonial India, the place of his birth, his age could not be verified and his record was not accepted by the official governing body World Masters Athletics.  Johnny Kelley ran his last full Boston Marathon at the documented age of 84 in 1992. He previously had won the Boston Marathon in both 1935 and 1945 respectively. Between 1934 and 1950, Johnny finished in the top five 15 times, consistently running in the 2:30s and finishing in second place a record seven times at Boston. A fixture at Boston for more than a half century, his 1992 61st start and 58th finish in Boston is a record which still stands today.  Gladys Burrill, a 92-year-old Prospect, Oregon woman and part-time resident of Hawaii, previously held the Guinness World Records title of oldest person to complete a marathon with her 9 hours 53 minutes performance at the 2010 Honolulu Marathon.[115][116] The records of the Association of Road Racing Statisticians, at that time, however, suggested that Singh was overall the oldest marathoner, completing the 2004 London Marathon at the age of 93 years and 17 days, and that Burrill was the oldest female marathoner, completing the 2010 Honolulu Marathon at the age of 92 years and 19 days.[117] Singh's age was also reported to be 93 by other sources.[118][119]  In 2015, 92-year-old Harriette Thompson of Charlotte, North Carolina, completed the Rock 'n' Roll San Diego Marathon in 7 hours 24 minutes 36 seconds, thus becoming the oldest woman to complete a marathon.[120] While Gladys Burrill was 92 years and 19 days old when she completed her record-setting marathon, Harriette Thompson was 92 years and 65 days old when she completed hers.[120]  English born Canadian Ed Whitlock is the oldest to complete a marathon in under 3 hours at age 74, and under 4 hours at age 85.[121][122]  Budhia Singh, a boy from Odisha, India, completed his first marathon at age five. He trained under the coach Biranchi Das, who saw potential in him. In May 2006, Budhia was temporarily banned from running by the ministers of child welfare, as his life could be at risk. His coach was also arrested for exploiting and cruelty to a child and was later murdered in an unrelated incident. Budhia is now at a state-run sports academy.[123]  The youngest under 4 hours is Mary Etta Boitano at age 7 years, 284 days; under 3 hours Julie Mullin at 10 years 180 days; and under 2:50 Carrie Garritson at 11 years 116 days.[121]  In 2016, Running USA estimated that there were approximately 507,600 marathon finishers in the United States,[124] while other sources reported greater than 550,000 finishers.[125] The chart below from Running USA provides the estimated U.S. Marathon Finisher totals going back to 1976.  Marathon running has become an obsession in China, with 22 marathon races in 2011 increasing to 400 in 2017. In 2015, 75 Chinese runners participated in the Boston Marathon and this increased to 278 in 2017.[126]  As marathon running has become more popular, some athletes have undertaken challenges involving running a series of marathons.  The 100 Marathon Club is intended to provide a focal point for all runners, particularly from the United Kingdom or Ireland, who have completed 100 or more races of marathon distance or longer. At least 10 of these events must be United Kingdom or Ireland Road Marathons.[127] Club chairman Roger Biggs has run more than 700 marathons or ultras. Brian Mills completed his 800th marathon on 17 September 2011.  Steve Edwards, a member of the 100 Marathon Club, set the world record for running 500 marathons in the fastest average finish time of 3 hours 15 minutes, at the same time becoming the first man to run 500 marathons with an official time below 3 hours 30 minutes, on 11 November 2012 at Milton Keynes, England. The records took 24 years to achieve. Edwards was 49 at the time.[128]  Over 350 individuals have completed a marathon in each state of the United States plus Washington, D.C., and some have done it as many as eight times.[129] Beverly Paquin, a 22-year-old nurse from Iowa, was the youngest woman to run a marathon in all 50 states in 2010.[130] A few weeks later, still in 2010, Morgan Cummings (also 22) became the youngest woman to complete a marathon in all 50 states and DC.[131] In 2004, Chuck Bryant of Miami, Florida, who lost his right leg below the knee, became the first amputee to finish this circuit.[132] Bryant has completed a total of 59 marathons on his prosthesis. Twenty-seven people have run a marathon on each of the seven continents, and 31 people have run a marathon in each of the Canadian provinces. In 1980, in what was termed the Marathon of Hope, Terry Fox, who had lost a leg to cancer and so ran with one artificial leg, attained 5,373\u00a0km (3,339\u00a0mi) of his proposed cross-Canada cancer fundraising run, maintaining an average of over 37\u00a0km (23\u00a0mi), close to the planned marathon distance, for each of 143 consecutive days.[133]  On 25 September 2011, Patrick Finney of Grapevine, Texas became the first person with multiple sclerosis to finish a marathon in each state of the United States. In 2004, \"the disease had left him unable to walk. But unwilling to endure a life of infirmity, Finney managed to regain his ability to balance on two feet, to walk\u00a0\u2013 and eventually to run\u00a0\u2013 through extensive rehabilitation therapy and new medications.\"[134]  In 2003, British adventurer Sir Ranulph Fiennes completed seven marathons on seven continents in seven days.[135] He completed this feat despite suffering from a heart attack and undergoing a double heart bypass operation just four months before.[136] This feat has since been eclipsed by Irish ultramarathon runner Richard Donovan who in 2009 completed seven marathons on seven continents in under 132 hours (five and a half days).[137] Starting 1 February 2012 he improved on this by completing the 7 on 7 in under 120 hours or in less than five days.[138][139]  On 30 November 2013, 69-year-old Larry Macon set a Guinness World Record for Most Marathons Run in a Year by Man by running 238 marathons. Larry Macon celebrated his 1,000th career marathon at the Cowtown Marathon in Ft. Worth on 24 February 2013.[140]  Other goals are to attempt to run marathons on a series of consecutive weekends (Richard Worley on 159 weekends),[141] or to run the most marathons during a particular year or the most in a lifetime. A pioneer in running multiple marathons was Sy Mah of Toledo, Ohio, who ran 524 before he died in 1988.[142] As of 30 June 2007, Horst Preisler of Germany had successfully completed 1214 marathons plus 347 ultramarathons, a total of 1561 events at marathon distance or longer.[143] Sigrid Eichner, Christian Hottas and Hans-Joachim Meyer have also all completed over 1000 marathons each.[144] Norm Frank of the United States is credited with 945 marathons.[145]  Christian Hottas is meanwhile the first runner who ever completed 2000 marathons. He ran his 2000th at TUI Marathon Hannover on 5 May 2013 together with a group of more than 80 friends from 11 countries, including 8 officers from the 100 Marathons Clubs U.K., North-America, Germany, Denmark, Austria and Italy.[146] Hottas completed his 2500th marathon on 4 December 2016.[147]  In 2010, Stefaan Engels, a Belgian, set out to run the marathon distance every day of the year. Because of a foot injury he had to resort to a handcycle near the end of January 2010. However, on 5 February he was fully recovered and decided to reset the counter back to zero.[148] By 30 March he broke the existing record of Akinori Kusuda, from Japan, who completed 52 marathons in a row in 2009. On 5 February 2011, Engels had run 365 marathon distances in as many days.[149] Ricardo Abad Mart\u00ednez, from Spain, later ran 150 marathons in 150 consecutive days in 2009,[150] and subsequently 500 marathons in a row, from October 2010 to February 2012.[151]  Some runners compete to run the same marathons for the most consecutive years. For example, Johnny Kelley completed 58 Boston Marathons (he entered the race 61 times).[152][circular reference][153] Currently, the longest consecutive streak of Boston Marathon finishes\u201445 in a row\u2014is held by Bennett Beach, of Bethesda, Maryland.[154]  Most participants do not run a marathon to win. More important for most runners is their personal finishing time and their placement within their specific gender and age group, though some runners just want to finish. Strategies for completing a marathon include running the whole distance[160] and a run\u2013walk strategy.[4] In 2005, the average marathon time in the U.S. was 4 hours 32 minutes 8 seconds for men, 5 hours 6 minutes 8 seconds for women.[161] In 2015, the men's and women's median marathon times were 4 hours 20 minutes 13 seconds and 4 hours 45 minutes 30 seconds respectively.[162]  A goal many runners aim for is to break certain time barriers. For example, recreational first-timers often try to run the marathon under four hours; more competitive runners may attempt to finish under three hours.[163] Other benchmarks are the qualifying times for major marathons. The Boston Marathon, the oldest marathon in the United States, requires a qualifying time for all non-professional runners.[164] The New York City Marathon also requires a qualifying time for guaranteed entry, at a significantly faster pace than Boston's.[165]  Typically, there is a maximum allowed time of about six hours after which the marathon route is closed, although some larger marathons keep the course open considerably longer (eight hours or more). Many marathons around the world have such time limits by which all runners must have crossed the finish line. Anyone slower than the limit will be picked up by a sweeper bus. In many cases the marathon organizers are required to reopen the roads to the public so that traffic can return to normal.  With the growth in popularity of marathon-running, many marathons across the United States and the world have been filling to capacity faster than ever before. When the Boston Marathon opened up registration for its 2011 running, the field capacity was filled within eight hours.[166]  The long run is an important element in marathon training.[167] Recreational runners commonly try to reach a maximum of about 32\u00a0km (20\u00a0mi) in their longest weekly run and a total of about 64\u00a0km (40\u00a0mi) a week when training for the marathon, but wide variability exists in practice and in recommendations. More experienced marathoners may run a longer distance during the week. Greater weekly training mileages can offer greater results in terms of distance and endurance, but also carry a greater risk of training injury.[168] Most male elite marathon runners will complete weekly distances of over 160\u00a0km (100\u00a0mi).[168] It is recommended that those new to running should get a checkup from their doctor, as there are certain warning signs and risk factors that should be evaluated before undertaking any new workout program, especially marathon training.[169]  Many training programs last a minimum of five or six months, with a gradual increase in the distance run and finally, for recovery, a period of tapering in the one to three weeks preceding the race. For beginners wishing to merely finish a marathon, a minimum of four months of running four days a week is recommended.[170][171] Many trainers recommend a weekly increase in mileage of no more than 10%. It is also often advised to maintain a consistent running program for six weeks or so before beginning a marathon training program, to allow the body to adapt to the new stresses.[172] The marathon training program itself would suppose variation between hard and easy training, with a periodization of the general plan.[173]  Training programs can be found at the websites of Runner's World,[174] Hal Higdon,[160] Jeff Galloway,[4] RunnersWorld Tulsa Archived 30 May 2023 at the Wayback Machine, and the Boston Athletic Association,[175] and in numerous other published sources, including the websites of specific marathons.  Many local running stores sponsor training programs for the community. RunnersWorld Tulsa Archived 30 May 2023 at the Wayback Machine, for example, has half and full marathon training programs that consider an individual's pace and desired distance. These kinds of groups offer connection to your running community\u2014an invaluable source of support, encouragement, and accountability.  The last long training run might be undertaken up to two weeks prior to the event. Many marathon runners also \"carbo-load\" (increase carbohydrate intake while holding total caloric intake constant) during the week before the marathon to allow their bodies to store more glycogen.  Carbohydrates that a person eats are converted by the liver and muscles into glycogen for storage. Glycogen burns rapidly to provide quick energy. Runners can store about 8 MJ or 2,000 kcal worth of glycogen in their bodies, enough for about 30\u00a0km\/18\u201320 miles of running. Many runners report that running becomes noticeably more difficult at that point.[176] When glycogen runs low, the body must then obtain energy by burning stored fat, which does not burn as readily. When this happens, the runner will experience dramatic fatigue and is said to \"hit the wall\". The aim of training for the marathon, according to many coaches,[177] is to maximize the limited glycogen available so that the fatigue of the \"wall\" is not as dramatic. This is accomplished in part by utilizing a higher percentage of energy from burned fat even during the early phase of the race, thus conserving glycogen.[citation needed]  Carbohydrate-based \"energy gels\" are used by runners to avoid or reduce the effect of \"hitting the wall\", as they provide easy to digest energy during the run. Energy gels usually contain varying amounts of sodium and potassium and some also contain caffeine. They need to be consumed with a certain amount of water. Recommendations for how often to take an energy gel during the race range widely.[177]  Alternatives to gels include various forms of concentrated sugars, and foods high in simple carbohydrates that can be digested easily. Many runners experiment with consuming energy supplements during training runs to determine what works best for them. Consumption of food while running sometimes makes the runner sick. Runners are advised not to ingest a new food or medicine just prior to or during a race.[177] It is also important to refrain from taking any of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory class of pain relievers (NSAIDs, e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen), as these drugs may change the way the kidneys regulate their blood flow and may lead to serious kidney problems, especially in cases involving moderate to severe dehydration. NSAIDS block the COX-2 enzyme pathway to prevent the production of prostaglandins. These prostaglandins may act as inflammation factors throughout the body, but they also play a crucial role in maintenance of water retention. In less than 5% of the whole population that take NSAIDS, individuals may be more negatively sensitive to renal prostaglandin synthesis inhibition.[178]  A study of the performance of 1.8 million participants in the Berlin, London, Paris, Boston, Chicago, and New York marathons during the years from 2001 to 2010 found that runners recorded their fastest times when the temperature was around 6\u00a0\u00b0C (43\u00a0\u00b0F), with an increase of 10\u00a0\u00b0C (18\u00a0\u00b0F) leading to a 1.5% reduction in speed.[179][180] A July 2020 study found that increasing temperatures affected faster runners' performance more than slower ones.[181]  Marathon participation may result in various medical, musculoskeletal, and dermatological complaints.[182] Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is a common condition affecting runners during the first week following a marathon.[183] Various types of mild exercise or massage have been recommended to alleviate pain secondary to DOMS.[183] Dermatological issues frequently include \"jogger's nipple\", \"jogger's toe\", and blisters.[184]  The immune system is reportedly suppressed for a short time.[185] Changes to the blood chemistry may lead physicians to mistakenly diagnose heart malfunction.[186]  After long training runs and the marathon itself, consuming carbohydrates to replace glycogen stores and protein to aid muscle recovery is commonly recommended. In addition, soaking the lower half of the body for approximately 20 minutes in cold or ice water may force blood through the leg muscles to speed recovery.[187][188]  Marathon running has various health risks, though these can be diminished with preparation and care.[189] Training and the races themselves can put runners under stress. While very rare, even death is a possibility during a race.  Common minor health risks include blisters, tendonitis, fatigue, knee or ankle sprain, dehydration (electrolyte imbalance), and other conditions. Many are categorised as overuse injuries.  In 2016, a systematic medical review found that the risk of sudden cardiac death during or immediately after a marathon was between 0.6 and 1.9 deaths per 100,000 participants, varying across the specific studies and the methods used, and not controlling for age or gender.[190] Since the risk is small, cardiac screening programs for marathons are uncommon. However, this review was not an attempt to assess the overall cardiac health impact of marathon running.  A 2006 study of non-elite Boston Marathon participants tested runners for certain proteins that indicate heart damage or dysfunction (see Troponin) and gave them echocardiogram scans, before and after the marathon. The study revealed that, in that sample of 60 people, runners who had averaged fewer than 56\u00a0km (35\u00a0mi) of weekly training in the 4 months before the race were most likely to show some heart damage or dysfunction, while runners who had done more than 72\u00a0km (45\u00a0mi) of weekly training showed few or no heart problems.[191]  According to a Canadian study presented in 2010, running a marathon can temporarily result in decreased function of more than half the muscle segments in the heart's main pumping chamber, but neighboring segments are generally able to compensate. Full recovery is reached within three months. The fitter the runner, the less the effect. The runners with decreased left ventricle function had an average peak weekly training distance of 55.1\u00a0km (34.2\u00a0mi), while those who did not averaged 69.1\u00a0km (42.9\u00a0mi). The marathon was held in 35\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F) weather. According to one of the researchers: \"Regular exercise reduces cardiovascular risk by a factor of two or three in the long run, but while we're doing vigorous exercise such as marathon running, our cardiac risk increases by seven.\"[192][193]  Overconsumption is the most significant concern associated with water consumption during marathons. Drinking excessive amounts of fluid during a race can lead to dilution of sodium in the blood, a condition called exercise-associated hyponatremia, which may result in vomiting, seizures, coma and even death.[194] Dr. Lewis G. Maharam, medical director for the New York City Marathon, stated in 2005: \"There are no reported cases of dehydration causing death in the history of world running, but there are plenty of cases of people dying of hyponatremia.\"[195]  For example, Dr. Cynthia Lucero died at the age of 28 while participating in the 2002 Boston Marathon. It was Lucero's second marathon.[196] At mile 22, Lucero complained of feeling \"dehydrated and rubber-legged.\"[197] She soon wobbled and collapsed to the ground, and was unconscious by the time the paramedics reached her. Lucero was admitted to Brigham and Women's Hospital and died two days later.[198]  Lucero's cause of death was determined to be hyponatremic encephalopathy, a condition that causes swelling of the brain due to an imbalance of sodium in the blood known as exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH). While EAH is sometimes referred to as \"water intoxication\", Lucero drank large amounts of Gatorade during the race,[199][200] demonstrating that runners who consume sodium-containing sports drinks in excess of thirst can still develop EAH.[199][201] Because hyponatremia is caused by excessive water retention, and not just loss of sodium, consumption of sports drinks or salty foods may not prevent hyponatremia.[202]  Women are more prone to hyponatremia than men. A study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that 13% of runners completing the 2002 Boston Marathon had hyponatremia.[203]  The International Marathon Medical Directors Association (IMMDA) advised in 2006 that fluid intake should be adjusted individually according to factors such as body weight, sex, climate, pace, fitness (VO2 max), and sweat rate, as fluid requirements can vary between people depending on these variables. The IMMDA also recommended sports drinks that include carbohydrates and electrolytes instead of plain water and said that runners should \"drink to thirst\", trying to refrain from drinking at every fluid station before feeling thirsty.[204] Heat exposure leads to diminished thirst drive and thirst may not be a sufficient incentive to drink in many situations.[205] The IMMDA and HSL Harpur Hill give recommendations to drink fluid in small volumes frequently at an approximate rate falling between 100\u2013250\u00a0ml (3.4\u20138.5\u00a0US\u00a0fl\u00a0oz) every 15 minutes.[205][204] A patient suffering hyponatremia can be given a small volume of a concentrated salt solution intravenously to raise sodium concentrations in the blood. Some runners weigh themselves before running and write the results on their bibs. If anything goes wrong, first aid workers can use the weight information to tell if the patient had consumed too much water.  Exertional heat stroke is an emergency condition in which thermoregulation fails and the body temperature rises dangerously above 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F). It becomes a greater risk in warm and humid weather, even for young and fit individuals. Treatment requires rapid physical cooling of the body.[206]  Some charities seek to associate with various races. Some marathon organizers set aside a portion of their limited entry slots for charity organizations to sell to members in exchange for donations. Runners are given the option to sign up to run particular races, especially when marathon entries are no longer available to the general public.[citation needed] In some cases, charities organize their own marathon as a fund-raiser, gaining funds via entry fees or sponsorships.[citation needed]  In 2015 the Mars rover Opportunity attained the distance of a marathon from its starting location on Mars, and the valley where it achieved this distance was called Marathon Valley, which was then explored.[207][208]  Records  Lists  Related races  Other endurance races  Organizations  Notable races  Other related topics "},{"title":"Scottish Gaelic","content":"  Scottish Gaelic (\/\u02c8\u0261\u00e6l\u026ak\/, GAL-ick; endonym: G\u00e0idhlig [\u02c8ka\u02d0l\u026ak\u02b2] \u24d8), also known as Scots Gaelic or simply Gaelic, is a Goidelic language (in the Celtic branch of the Indo-European language family) native to the Gaels of Scotland. As a Goidelic language, Scottish Gaelic, as well as both Irish and Manx, developed out of Old Irish.[3] It became a distinct spoken language sometime in the 13th century in the Middle Irish period, although a common literary language was shared by the Gaels of both Ireland and Scotland until well into the 17th century.[4] Most of modern Scotland was once Gaelic-speaking, as evidenced especially by Gaelic-language place names.[5][6]  In the 2011 census of Scotland, 57,375 people (1.1% of the Scottish population aged over three years old) reported being able to speak Gaelic, 1,275 fewer than in 2001. The highest percentages of Gaelic speakers were in the Outer Hebrides. Nevertheless, there is a language revival, and the number of speakers of the language under age 20 did not decrease between the 2001 and 2011 censuses.[7]  Outside of Scotland, a dialect known as Canadian Gaelic has been spoken in Canada since the 18th century. In the 2021 census, 2,170 Canadian residents claimed knowledge of Scottish Gaelic, a decline from 3,980 speakers in the 2016 census.[8][9] There exists a particular concentration of speakers in Nova Scotia, with historic communities in other parts of Canada having largely disappeared.[10]  The Scottish Government declares that it protects Scottish Gaelic \"as an official language of Scotland\",[11] however, this is disputed by others, who argue that Scottish Gaelic is not an official language of the United Kingdom or Scotland.[12][13] Scottish Gaelic is classed as an indigenous language under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which the UK Government has ratified, and the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005 established a language-development body, B\u00f2rd na G\u00e0idhlig.[14]  Aside from \"Scottish Gaelic\", the language may also be referred to simply as \"Gaelic\", pronounced \/\u02c8\u0261\u00e6l\u026ak\/ GAL-ick in English. However, \"Gaelic\" \/\u02c8\u0261e\u026al\u026ak\/ GAY-lik also refers to the Irish language (Gaeilge)[15] and the Manx language (Gaelg).  Scottish Gaelic is distinct from Scots, the Middle English-derived language which had come to be spoken in most of the Lowlands of Scotland by the early modern era. Prior to the 15th century, this language was known as Inglis (\"English\")[16] by its own speakers, with Gaelic being called Scottis (\"Scottish\"). Beginning in the late 15th century, it became increasingly common for such speakers to refer to Scottish Gaelic as Erse (\"Irish\") and the Lowland vernacular as Scottis.[17] Today, Scottish Gaelic is recognised as a separate language from Irish, so the word Erse in reference to Scottish Gaelic is no longer used.[18]  Based on medieval traditional accounts and the apparent evidence from linguistic geography, Gaelic has been commonly believed to have been brought to Scotland, in the 4th\u20135th centuries CE, by settlers from Ireland who founded the Gaelic kingdom of D\u00e1l Riata on Scotland's west coast in present-day Argyll.[19]:\u200a551\u200a[20]:\u200a66\u200a An alternative view has been voiced by archaeologist Ewan Campbell, who has argued that the putative migration or takeover is not reflected in archaeological or placename data (as pointed out earlier by Leslie Alcock). Campbell has also questioned the age and reliability of the medieval historical sources speaking of a conquest. Instead, he has inferred that Argyll formed part of a common Q-Celtic-speaking area with Ireland, connected rather than divided by the sea, since the Iron Age.[21] These arguments have been opposed by some scholars defending the early dating of the traditional accounts and arguing for other interpretations of the archaeological evidence.[22]  Regardless of how it came to be spoken in the region, Gaelic in Scotland was mostly confined to D\u00e1l Riata until the eighth century, when it began expanding into Pictish areas north of the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Clyde [citation needed]. During the reign of Caustant\u00edn mac \u00c1eda (Constantine II, 900\u2013943), outsiders began to refer to the region as the kingdom of Alba rather than as the kingdom of the Picts. However, though the Pictish language did not disappear suddenly, a process of Gaelicisation (which may have begun generations earlier) was clearly under way during the reigns of Caustant\u00edn and his successors. By a certain point, probably during the 11th century, all the inhabitants of Alba had become fully Gaelicised Scots, and Pictish identity was forgotten.[23] Bilingualism in Pictish and Gaelic, prior to the former's extinction, led to the presence of Pictish loanwords in Gaelic[24] and syntactic influence[25] which could be considered to constitute a Pictish substrate.[26]  In 1018, after the conquest of Lothian by the Kingdom of Scotland, Gaelic reached its social, cultural, political, and geographic zenith.[27]:\u200a16\u201318\u200a Colloquial speech in Scotland had been developing independently of that in Ireland since the eighth century.[28] For the first time, the entire region of modern-day Scotland was called Scotia in Latin, and Gaelic was the lingua Scotica.[29]:\u200a276\u200a[30]:\u200a554\u200a In southern Scotland, Gaelic was strong in Galloway, adjoining areas to the north and west, West Lothian, and parts of western Midlothian. It was spoken to a lesser degree in north Ayrshire, Renfrewshire, the Clyde Valley and eastern Dumfriesshire. In south-eastern Scotland, there is no evidence that Gaelic was ever widely spoken.[31]  Many historians mark the reign of King Malcolm Canmore (Malcolm III) between 1058 and 1093 as the beginning of Gaelic's eclipse in Scotland. His wife Margaret of Wessex spoke no Gaelic, gave her children Anglo-Saxon rather than Gaelic names, and brought many English bishops, priests, and monastics to Scotland.[27]:\u200a19\u200a When Malcolm and Margaret died in 1093, the Gaelic aristocracy rejected their anglicised sons and instead backed Malcolm's brother Domnall B\u00e1n (Donald III).[citation needed] Donald had spent 17 years in Gaelic Ireland and his power base was in the thoroughly Gaelic west of Scotland. He was the last Scottish monarch to be buried on Iona, the traditional burial place of the Gaelic Kings of D\u00e0l Riada and the Kingdom of Alba.[citation needed] However, during the reigns of Malcolm Canmore's sons, Edgar, Alexander I and David I (their successive reigns lasting 1097\u20131153), Anglo-Norman names and practices spread throughout Scotland south of the Forth\u2013Clyde line and along the northeastern coastal plain as far north as Moray. Norman French completely displaced Gaelic at court. The establishment of royal burghs throughout the same area, particularly under David I, attracted large numbers of foreigners speaking Old English. This was the beginning of Gaelic's status as a predominantly rural language in Scotland.[27]:\u200a19\u201323\u200a  Clan chiefs in the northern and western parts of Scotland continued to support Gaelic bards who remained a central feature of court life there. The semi-independent Lordship of the Isles in the Hebrides and western coastal mainland remained thoroughly Gaelic since the language's recovery there in the 12th century, providing a political foundation for cultural prestige down to the end of the 15th century.[30]:\u200a553\u20136\u200a  By the mid-14th century what eventually came to be called Scots (at that time termed Inglis) emerged as the official language of government and law.[32]:\u200a139\u200a Scotland's emergent nationalism in the era following the conclusion of the Wars of Scottish Independence was organized using Scots as well. For example, the nation's great patriotic literature including John Barbour's The Brus (1375) and Blind Harry's The Wallace (before 1488) was written in Scots, not Gaelic. By the end of the 15th century, English\/Scots speakers referred to Gaelic instead as 'Yrisch' or 'Erse', i.e. Irish and their own language as 'Scottis'.[27]:\u200a19\u201323\u200a  A steady shift away from Scottish Gaelic continued into and through the modern era. Some of this was driven by policy decisions by government or other organisations, while some originated from social changes. In the last quarter of the 20th century, efforts began to encourage use of the language.  The Statutes of Iona, enacted by James VI in 1609, was one piece of legislation that addressed, among other things, the Gaelic language. It required the heirs of clan chiefs to be educated in lowland, Protestant, English-speaking schools. James VI took several such measures to impose his rule on the Highland and Island region. In 1616, the Privy Council proclaimed that schools teaching in English should be established. Gaelic was seen, at this time, as one of the causes of the instability of the region. It was also associated with Catholicism.[33]:\u200a110\u2013113\u200a  The Society in Scotland for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge (SSPCK) was founded in 1709. They met in 1716, immediately after the failed Jacobite rising of 1715, to consider the reform and civilisation of the Highlands, which they sought to achieve by teaching English and the Protestant religion. Initially, their teaching was entirely in English, but soon the impracticality of educating Gaelic-speaking children in this way gave rise to a modest concession: In 1723, teachers were allowed to translate English words in the Bible into Gaelic to aid comprehension, but there was no further permitted use. Other less prominent schools worked in the Highlands at the same time, also teaching in English. This process of anglicisation paused when evangelical preachers arrived in the Highlands, convinced that people should be able to read religious texts in their own language. The first well known translation of the Bible into Scottish Gaelic was made in 1767, when James Stuart of Killin and Dugald Buchanan of Rannoch produced a translation of the New Testament. In 1798, four tracts in Gaelic were published by the Society for Propagating the Gospel at Home, with 5,000 copies of each printed. Other publications followed, with a full Gaelic Bible in 1801. The influential and effective Gaelic Schools Society was founded in 1811. Their purpose was to teach Gaels to read the Bible in their own language. In the first quarter of the 19th century, the SSPCK (despite their anti-Gaelic attitude in prior years) and the British and Foreign Bible Society distributed 60,000 Gaelic Bibles and 80,000 New Testaments.[34]:\u200a98\u200a It is estimated that this overall schooling and publishing effort gave some 300,000 people in the Highlands some basic literacy.[33]:\u200a110\u2013117\u200a Very few European languages have made the transition to a modern literary language without an early modern translation of the Bible; the lack of a well known translation may have contributed to the decline of Scottish Gaelic.[35]:\u200a168\u2013202\u200a  Counterintuitively, access to schooling in Gaelic increased knowledge of English. In 1829, the Gaelic Schools Society reported that parents were unconcerned about their children learning Gaelic, but were anxious to have them taught English. The SSPCK also found Highlanders to have significant prejudice against Gaelic. T. M. Devine attributes this to an association between English and the prosperity of employment: the Highland economy relied greatly on seasonal migrant workers travelling outside the G\u00e0idhealtachd. In 1863, an observer sympathetic to Gaelic stated that \"knowledge of English is indispensable to any poor islander who wishes to learn a trade or to earn his bread beyond the limits of his native Isle\". Generally, rather than Gaelic speakers, it was Celtic societies in the cities and professors of Celtic from universities who sought to preserve the language.[33]:\u200a116\u2013117\u200a  The Education (Scotland) Act 1872 provided universal education in Scotland, but completely ignored Gaelic in its plans. The mechanism for supporting Gaelic through the Education Codes issued by the Scottish Education Department were steadily used to overcome this omission, with many concessions in place by 1918. However, the members of Highland school boards tended to have anti-Gaelic attitudes and served as an obstacle to Gaelic education in the late 19th and early 20th century.[33]:\u200a110\u2013111\u200a  Loss of life due to World War I and the 1919 sinking of the HMY Iolaire, combined with emigration, resulted in the 1910s seeing unprecedented damage to the use of Scottish Gaelic, with a 46% fall in monolingual speakers and a 19% fall in bilingual speakers between the 1911 and 1921 Censuses.[36] Michelle MacLeod of Aberdeen University has said that there was no other period with such a high fall in the number of monolingual Gaelic speakers: \"Gaelic speakers became increasingly the exception from that point forward with bilingualism replacing monolingualism as the norm for Gaelic speakers.\"[36]  The Linguistic Survey of Scotland (1949\u20131997) surveyed both the dialect of the Scottish Gaelic language, and also mixed use of English and Gaelic across the Highlands and Islands.[37]  Dialects of Lowland Gaelic have been defunct since the 18th century. Gaelic in the Eastern and Southern Scottish Highlands, although alive until the mid-20th century, is now largely defunct. Although modern Scottish Gaelic is dominated by the dialects of the Outer Hebrides and Isle of Skye, there remain some speakers of the Inner Hebridean dialects of Tiree and Islay, and even a few native speakers from Western Highland areas including Wester Ross, northwest Sutherland, Lochaber and Argyll. Dialects on both sides of the Straits of Moyle (the North Channel) linking Scottish Gaelic with Irish are now extinct, though native speakers were still to be found on the Mull of Kintyre, on Rathlin and in North East Ireland as late as the mid-20th century. Records of their speech show that Irish and Scottish Gaelic existed in a dialect chain with no clear language boundary.[38] Some features of moribund dialects have been preserved in Nova Scotia, including the pronunciation of the broad or velarised l (l\u032a\u02e0) as [w], as in the Lochaber dialect.[39]:\u200a131\u200a    The Endangered Languages Project lists Gaelic's status as \"threatened\", with \"20,000 to 30,000 active users\".[40][41][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] UNESCO classifies Gaelic as \"definitely endangered\".[42]  The 1755\u20132001 figures are census data quoted by MacAulay.[43]:\u200a141\u200a The 2011 Gaelic speakers figures come from table KS206SC of the 2011 Census. The 2011 total population figure comes from table KS101SC. The numbers of Gaelic speakers relate to the numbers aged 3 and over, and the percentages are calculated using those and the number of the total population aged 3 and over.   The 2011 UK Census showed a total of 57,375 Gaelic speakers in Scotland (1.1% of population over three years old), of whom only 32,400 could also read and write the language.[44] Compared with the 2001 Census, there has been a diminution of about 1300 people.[45] This is the smallest drop between censuses since the Gaelic-language question was first asked in 1881. The Scottish government's language minister and B\u00f2rd na G\u00e0idhlig took this as evidence that Gaelic's long decline has slowed.[46]  The main stronghold of the language continues to be the Outer Hebrides (Na h-Eileanan Siar), where the overall proportion of speakers is 52.2%. Important pockets of the language also exist in the Highlands (5.4%) and in Argyll and Bute (4.0%) and Inverness (4.9%). The locality with the largest absolute number is Glasgow with 5,878 such persons, who make up over 10% of all of Scotland's Gaelic speakers.  Gaelic continues to decline in its traditional heartland. Between 2001 and 2011, the absolute number of Gaelic speakers fell sharply in the Western Isles (\u22121,745), Argyll & Bute (\u2212694), and Highland (\u2212634). The drop in Stornoway, the largest parish in the Western Isles by population, was especially acute, from 57.5% of the population in 1991 to 43.4% in 2011.[47] The only parish outside the Western Isles over 40% Gaelic-speaking is Kilmuir in Northern Skye at 46%. The islands in the Inner Hebrides with significant percentages of Gaelic speakers are Tiree (38.3%), Raasay (30.4%), Skye (29.4%), Lismore (26.9%), Colonsay (20.2%), and Islay (19.0%).  Today, no civil parish in Scotland has a proportion of Gaelic speakers greater than 65% (the highest value is in Barvas, Lewis, with 64.1%). In addition, no civil parish on mainland Scotland has a proportion of Gaelic speakers greater than 20% (the highest is in Ardnamurchan, Highland, with 19.3%). Out of a total of 871 civil parishes in Scotland, the proportion of Gaelic speakers exceeds 50% in seven parishes, 25% in 14 parishes, and 10% in 35 parishes.   Decline in traditional areas has recently been balanced by growth in the Scottish Lowlands. Between the 2001 and 2011 censuses, the number of Gaelic speakers rose in nineteen of the country's 32 council areas. The largest absolute gains were in Aberdeenshire (+526), North Lanarkshire (+305), the Aberdeen City council area (+216), and East Ayrshire (+208). The largest relative gains were in Aberdeenshire (+0.19%), East Ayrshire (+0.18%), Moray (+0.16%), and Orkney (+0.13%).[citation needed]  In 2018, the census of pupils in Scotland showed 520 students in publicly funded schools had Gaelic as the main language at home, an increase of 5% from 497 in 2014. During the same period, Gaelic medium education in Scotland has grown, with 4,343 pupils (6.3 per 1000) being educated in a Gaelic-immersion environment in 2018, up from 3,583 pupils (5.3 per 1000) in 2014.[48] Data collected in 2007\u20132008 indicated that even among pupils enrolled in Gaelic medium schools, 81% of primary students and 74% of secondary students report using English more often than Gaelic when speaking with their mothers at home.[49] The effect on this of the significant increase in pupils in Gaelic-medium education since that time is unknown.  Gaelic Medium Education is one of the primary ways that the Scottish Government is addressing Gaelic language shift. Along with the B\u00f2rd na G\u00e0idhlig policies, preschool and daycare environments are also being used to create more opportunities for intergenerational language transmission in the Outer Hebrides.[50] \u00a0However, revitalization efforts are not unified within Scotland or Nova Scotia, Canada.[51] One can attend Sabhal M\u00f2r Ostaig, a national centre for Gaelic Language and Culture, based in Sleat, on the Isle of Skye. This institution is the only source for higher education which is conducted entirely in Scottish Gaelic.[52] They offer courses for Gaelic learners from beginners into fluency. They also offer regular bachelors and graduate programs delivered entirely in Gaelic. Concerns have been raised around the fluency achieved by learners within these language programs because they are disconnected from vernacular speech communities.[53][54] In regard to language revitalization planning efforts, many feel that the initiatives must come from within Gaelic speaking communities, be led by Gaelic speakers, and be designed to serve and increase fluency within the vernacular communities as the first and most viable resistance to total language shift from Gaelic to English.[51][53] Currently, language policies are focused on creating new language speakers through education, instead of focused on how to strengthen intergenerational transmission within existing Gaelic speaking communities.[51]  In the Outer Hebrides, accommodation ethics exist amongst native or local Gaelic speakers when engaging with new learners or non-locals.[53] Accommodation ethics, or ethics of accommodation, is a social practice where local or native speakers of Gaelic shift to speaking English when in the presence of non-Gaelic speakers out of a sense of courtesy or politeness. This accommodation ethic persists even in situations where new learners attempt to speak Gaelic with native speakers.[53] This creates a situation where new learners struggle to find opportunities to speak Gaelic with fluent speakers. Affect is the way people feel about something, or the emotional response to a particular situation or experience. For Gaelic speakers, there is a conditioned and socialized negative affect through a long history of negative Scottish media portrayal and public disrespect, state mandated restrictions on Gaelic usage, and highland clearances.[50][55][56] This negative affect towards speaking openly with non-native Gaelic speakers has led to a language ideology at odds with revitalization efforts on behalf of new speakers, state policies (such as the Gaelic Language Act), and family members reclaiming their lost mother tongue. New learners of Gaelic often have a positive affective stance to their language learning, and connect this learning journey towards Gaelic language revitalization.[57] The mismatch of these language ideologies, and differences in affective stance, has led to fewer speaking opportunities for adult language learners and therefore a challenge to revitalization efforts which occur outside the home. Positive engagements between language learners and native speakers of Gaelic through mentorship has proven to be productive in socializing new learners into fluency.[53][56]  Gaelic has long suffered from its lack of use in educational and administrative contexts and was long suppressed.[58]  The UK government has ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in respect of Gaelic. Gaelic, along with Irish and Welsh, is designated under Part III of the Charter, which requires the UK Government to take a range of concrete measures in the fields of education, justice, public administration, broadcasting and culture. It has not received the same degree of official recognition from the UK Government as Welsh. With the advent of devolution, however, Scottish matters have begun to receive greater attention, and it achieved a degree of official recognition when the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act was enacted by the Scottish Parliament on 21 April 2005.  The key provisions of the Act are:[59]  After its creation, B\u00f2rd na G\u00e0idhlig required a Gaelic Language Plan from the Scottish Government. This plan was accepted in 2008,[60] and some of its main commitments were: identity (signs, corporate identity); communications (reception, telephone, mailings, public meetings, complaint procedures); publications (PR and media, websites); staffing (language learning, training, recruitment).[60]  Following a consultation period, in which the government received many submissions, the majority of which asked that the bill be strengthened, a revised bill was published; the main alteration was that the guidance of the B\u00f2rd is now statutory (rather than advisory). In the committee stages in the Scottish Parliament, there was much debate over whether Gaelic should be given 'equal validity' with English. Due to executive concerns about resourcing implications if this wording was used, the Education Committee settled on the concept of 'equal respect'. It is not clear what the legal force of this wording is.  The Act was passed by the Scottish Parliament unanimously, with support from all sectors of the Scottish political spectrum, on 21 April 2005. Under the provisions of the Act, it will ultimately fall to BnG to secure the status of the Gaelic language as an official language of Scotland.  Some commentators, such as \u00c9amonn \u00d3 Grib\u00edn (2006) argue that the Gaelic Act falls so far short of the status accorded to Welsh that one would be foolish or na\u00efve to believe that any substantial change will occur in the fortunes of the language as a result of B\u00f2rd na G\u00e0idhlig's efforts.[61]  On 10 December 2008, to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Scottish Human Rights Commission had the UDHR translated into Gaelic for the first time.[62]  However, given there are no longer any monolingual Gaelic speakers,[63] following an appeal in the court case of Taylor v Haughney (1982), involving the status of Gaelic in judicial proceedings, the High Court ruled against a general right to use Gaelic in court proceedings.[64]  While the goal of the Gaelic Language Act was to aid in revitalization efforts through government mandated official language status, the outcome of the act is distanced from the actual minority language communities.[54] It helps to create visibility of the minority language in civil structures, but does not impact or address the lived experiences of the Gaelic speaker communities wherein the revitalization efforts may have a higher return of new Gaelic speakers. Efforts are being made to concentrate resources, language planning, and revitalization efforts towards vernacular communities in the Western Isles.[54]  The Scottish Qualifications Authority offer two streams of Gaelic examination across all levels of the syllabus: Gaelic for learners (equivalent to the modern foreign languages syllabus) and Gaelic for native speakers (equivalent to the English syllabus).[65][66]  An Comunn G\u00e0idhealach performs assessment of spoken Gaelic, resulting in the issue of a Bronze Card, Silver Card or Gold Card. Syllabus details are available on An Comunn's website. These are not widely recognised as qualifications, but are required for those taking part in certain competitions at the annual mods.[67]  In October 2009, a new agreement allowed Scottish Gaelic to be formally used between Scottish Government ministers and European Union officials. The deal was signed by Britain's representative to the EU, Sir Kim Darroch, and the Scottish government. This did not give Scottish Gaelic official status in the EU but gave it the right to be a means of formal communications in the EU's institutions. The Scottish government had to pay for the translation from Gaelic to other European languages. The deal was received positively in Scotland; Secretary of State for Scotland Jim Murphy said the move was a strong sign of the UK government's support for Gaelic. He said; \"Allowing Gaelic speakers to communicate with European institutions in their mother tongue is a progressive step forward and one which should be welcomed\".[citation needed] Culture Minister Mike Russell said; \"this is a significant step forward for the recognition of Gaelic both at home and abroad and I look forward to addressing the council in Gaelic very soon. Seeing Gaelic spoken in such a forum raises the profile of the language as we drive forward our commitment to creating a new generation of Gaelic speakers in Scotland.\"[68]  Bilingual road signs, street names, business and advertisement signage (in both Gaelic and English) are gradually being introduced throughout Gaelic-speaking regions in the Highlands and Islands, including Argyll. In many cases, this has simply meant re-adopting the traditional spelling of a name (such as R\u00e0tagan or Loch Ailleart rather than the anglicised forms Ratagan or Lochailort respectively).[69]  Some monolingual Gaelic road signs, particularly direction signs, are used on the Outer Hebrides, where a majority of the population can have a working knowledge of the language. These omit the English translation entirely.  Bilingual railway station signs are now more frequent than they used to be. Practically all the stations in the Highland area use both English and Gaelic, and the use of bilingual station signs has become more frequent in the Lowlands of Scotland, including areas where Gaelic has not been spoken for a long time.[citation needed]  This has been welcomed by many supporters of the language as a means of raising its profile as well as securing its future as a 'living language' (i.e. allowing people to use it to navigate from A to B in place of English) and creating a sense of place. However, in some places, such as Caithness, the Highland Council's intention to introduce bilingual signage has incited controversy.[70]  The Ordnance Survey has acted in recent years to correct many of the mistakes that appear on maps. They announced in 2004 that they intended to correct them and set up a committee to determine the correct forms of Gaelic place names for their maps.[69] Ainmean-\u00c0ite na h-Alba (\"Place names in Scotland\") is the national advisory partnership for Gaelic place names in Scotland.[71]  In the nineteenth century, Canadian Gaelic was the third-most widely spoken European language in British North America[72] and Gaelic-speaking immigrant communities could be found throughout what is modern-day Canada. Gaelic poets in Canada produced a significant literary tradition.[73] The number of Gaelic-speaking individuals and communities declined sharply, however, after the First World War.[74]  At the start of the 21st century, it was estimated that no more than 500 people in Nova Scotia still spoke Scottish Gaelic as a first language. In the 2011 census, 300 people claimed to have Gaelic as their first language (a figure that may include Irish Gaelic).[75] In the same 2011 census, 1,275 people claimed to speak Gaelic, a figure that not only included all Gaelic languages but also those people who are not first language speakers,[76] of whom 300 claim to have Gaelic as their \"mother tongue.\"[77][a]  The Nova Scotia government maintains the Office of Gaelic Affairs (Iomairtean na G\u00e0idhlig), which is dedicated to the development of Scottish Gaelic language, culture and tourism in Nova Scotia, and which estimates about 2,000 total Gaelic speakers to be in the province.[10] As in Scotland, areas of North-Eastern Nova Scotia and Cape Breton have bilingual street signs. Nova Scotia also has Comhairle na G\u00e0idhlig (The Gaelic Council of Nova Scotia), a non-profit society dedicated to the maintenance and promotion of the Gaelic language and culture in Maritime Canada. In 2018, the Nova Scotia government launched a new Gaelic vehicle licence plate to raise awareness of the language and help fund Gaelic language and culture initiatives.[79]  In September 2021, the first Gaelic-medium primary school outside of Scotland, named Taigh Sgoile na Drochaide, opened in Mabou, Nova Scotia.[80]  Maxville Public School in Maxville, Glengarry, Ontario, offers Scottish Gaelic lessons weekly.[81]  In Prince Edward Island, the Colonel Gray High School now offers both an introductory and an advanced course in Gaelic; both language and history are taught in these classes. This is the first recorded time that Gaelic has ever been taught as an official course on Prince Edward Island.[82]  The province of British Columbia is host to the Comunn G\u00e0idhlig Bhancoubhair (The Gaelic Society of Vancouver), the Vancouver Gaelic Choir, the Victoria Gaelic Choir, as well as the annual Gaelic festival M\u00f2d Vancouver. The city of Vancouver's Scottish Cultural Centre also holds seasonal Scottish Gaelic evening classes.  The BBC operates a Gaelic-language radio station Radio nan G\u00e0idheal as well as a television channel, BBC Alba. Launched on 19 September 2008, BBC Alba is widely available in the UK (on Freeview, Freesat, Sky and Virgin Media). It also broadcasts across Europe on the Astra 2 satellites.[83] The channel is being operated in partnership between BBC Scotland and MG Alba \u2013 an organisation funded by the Scottish Government, which works to promote the Gaelic language in broadcasting.[84] The ITV franchise in central Scotland, STV Central, has, in the past, produced a number of Scottish Gaelic programmes for both BBC Alba and its own main channel.[84]  Until BBC Alba was broadcast on Freeview, viewers were able to receive the channel TeleG, which broadcast for an hour every evening. Upon BBC Alba's launch on Freeview, it took the channel number that was previously assigned to TeleG.  There are also television programmes in the language on other BBC channels and on the independent commercial channels, usually subtitled in English. The ITV franchise in the north of Scotland, STV North (formerly Grampian Television) produces some non-news programming in Scottish Gaelic.  The Education (Scotland) Act 1872, which completely ignored Gaelic and led to generations of Gaels being forbidden to speak their native language in the classroom is now recognised as having dealt a major blow to the language. People still living in 2001 could recall being beaten for speaking Gaelic in school.[97] Even later, when these attitudes had changed, little provision was made for Gaelic medium education in Scottish schools. As late as 1958, even in Highland schools, only 20% of primary students were taught Gaelic as a subject, and only 5% were taught other subjects through the Gaelic language.[49]  Gaelic-medium playgroups for young children began to appear in Scotland during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Parent enthusiasm may have been a factor in the \"establishment of the first Gaelic medium primary school units in Glasgow and Inverness in 1985\".[98]  The first modern solely Gaelic-medium secondary school, Sgoil Gh\u00e0idhlig Ghlaschu (\"Glasgow Gaelic School\"), was opened at Woodside in Glasgow in 2006 (61 partially Gaelic-medium primary schools and approximately a dozen Gaelic-medium secondary schools also exist). According to B\u00f2rd na G\u00e0idhlig, a total of 2,092 primary pupils were enrolled in Gaelic-medium primary education in 2008\u201309, as opposed to 24 in 1985.[99]  The Columba Initiative, also known as colmcille (formerly Iomairt Cholm Cille), is a body that seeks to promote links between speakers of Scottish Gaelic and Irish.  In November 2019, the language-learning app Duolingo opened a beta course in Gaelic.[100][101][102]  Starting from summer 2020, children starting school in the Western Isles will be enrolled in GME (Gaelic-medium education) unless parents request differently. Children will be taught Scottish Gaelic from P1 to P4 and then English will be introduced to give them a bilingual education.[103]  In May 2004, the Nova Scotia government announced the funding of an initiative to support the language and its culture within the province. Several public schools in Northeastern Nova Scotia and Cape Breton offer Gaelic classes as part of the high-school curriculum.[104]  Maxville Public School in Maxville, Glengarry, Ontario, offers Scottish Gaelic lessons weekly. In Prince Edward Island, the Colonel Gray High School offer an introductory and an advanced course in Scottish Gaelic.[105]  A number of Scottish and some Irish universities offer full-time degrees including a Gaelic language element, usually graduating as Celtic Studies.  In Nova Scotia, Canada, St. Francis Xavier University, the Gaelic College of Celtic Arts and Crafts and Cape Breton University (formerly known as the \"University College of Cape Breton\") offer Celtic Studies degrees and\/or Gaelic language programs. The government's Office of Gaelic Affairs offers lunch-time lessons to public servants in Halifax.  In Russia the Moscow State University offers Gaelic language, history and culture courses.  The University of the Highlands and Islands offers a range of Gaelic language, history and culture courses at the National Certificate, Higher National Diploma, Bachelor of Arts (ordinary), Bachelor of Arts (Honours) and Master of Science levels. It offers opportunities for postgraduate research through the medium of Gaelic. Residential courses at Sabhal M\u00f2r Ostaig on the Isle of Skye offer adults the chance to become fluent in Gaelic in one year. Many continue to complete degrees, or to follow up as distance learners. A number of other colleges offer a one-year certificate course, which is also available online (pending accreditation).  Lews Castle College's Benbecula campus offers an independent 1-year course in Gaelic and Traditional Music (FE, SQF level 5\/6).  In the Western Isles, the isles of Lewis, Harris and North Uist have a Presbyterian majority (largely Church of Scotland \u2013 Eaglais na h-Alba in Gaelic, Free Church of Scotland and Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland). The isles of South Uist and Barra have a Catholic majority. All these churches have Gaelic-speaking congregations throughout the Western Isles. Notable city congregations with regular services in Gaelic are St Columba's Church, Glasgow and Greyfriars Tolbooth & Highland Kirk, Edinburgh. Leabhar Sheirbheisean\u2014a shorter Gaelic version of the English-language Book of Common Order\u2014was published in 1996 by the Church of Scotland.  The widespread use of English in worship has often been suggested as one of the historic reasons for the decline of Gaelic. The Church of Scotland is supportive today,[vague] but has a shortage of Gaelic-speaking ministers. The Free Church also recently announced plans to abolish Gaelic-language communion services, citing both a lack of ministers and a desire to have their congregations united at communion time.[106]  From the sixth century to the present day, Scottish Gaelic has been used as a literary language. Two prominent writers of the twentieth century are Anne Frater and Sorley MacLean.  Gaelic has its own version of European-wide names which also have English forms, for example: Iain (John), Alasdair (Alexander), Uilleam (William), Catr\u00econa (Catherine), Raibeart (Robert), Cairist\u00econa (Christina), Anna (Ann), M\u00e0iri (Mary), Seumas (James), P\u00e0draig (Patrick) and T\u00f2mas (Thomas). Not all traditional Gaelic names have direct equivalents in English: Oighrig, which is normally rendered as Euphemia (Effie) or Henrietta (Etta) (formerly also as Henny or even as Harriet), or, Diorbhal, which is \"matched\" with Dorothy, simply on the basis of a certain similarity in spelling. Many of these traditional Gaelic-only names are now regarded as old-fashioned, and hence are rarely or never used.  Some names have come into Gaelic from Old Norse; for example, Somhairle ( < Somarli\u00f0r), Tormod (< \u00de\u00f3rm\u00f3\u00f0r), Raghnall or Raonull (< R\u01ebgnvaldr), Torcuil (< \u00de\u00f3rkell, \u00de\u00f3rketill), \u00ccomhar (\u00cdvarr). These are conventionally rendered in English as Sorley (or, historically, Somerled), Norman, Ronald or Ranald, Torquil and Iver (or Evander).  Some Scottish names are Anglicized forms of Gaelic names: Aonghas \u2192 (Angus), D\u00f2mhnall\u2192 (Donald), for instance. Hamish, and the recently established Mhairi (pronounced [va\u02d0ri]) come from the Gaelic for, respectively, James, and Mary, but derive from the form of the names as they appear in the vocative case: Seumas (James) (nom.) \u2192 Sheumais (voc.) and M\u00e0iri (Mary) (nom.) \u2192 Mh\u00e0iri (voc.).  The most common class of Gaelic surnames are those beginning with mac (Gaelic for \"son\"), such as MacGillEathain\u2009\/\u2009MacIllEathain[107][108] (MacLean). The female form is nic (Gaelic for \"daughter\"), so Catherine MacPhee is properly called in Gaelic, Catr\u00econa Nic a' Ph\u00ec[109] (strictly, nic is a contraction of the Gaelic phrase nighean mhic, meaning \"daughter of the son\", thus NicDh\u00f2mhnaill[108] really means \"daughter of MacDonald\" rather than \"daughter of Donald\"). The \"of\" part actually comes from the genitive form of the patronymic that follows the prefix; in the case of MacDh\u00f2mhnaill, Dh\u00f2mhnaill (\"of Donald\") is the genitive form of D\u00f2mhnall (\"Donald\").[110]  Several colours give rise to common Scottish surnames: b\u00e0n (Bain \u2013 white), ruadh (Roy \u2013 red), dubh (Dow, Duff \u2013 black), donn (Dunn \u2013 brown), buidhe (Bowie \u2013 yellow) although in Gaelic these occur as part of a fuller form such as MacGille 'son of the servant of', i.e. MacGilleBh\u00e0in, MacGilleRuaidh, MacGilleDhuibh, MacGilleDhuinn, MacGilleBhuidhe.  Most varieties of Gaelic show either eight or nine vowel qualities (\/i e \u025b a \u0254 o u \u0264 \u026f\/) in their inventory of vowel phonemes, which can be either long or short. There are also two reduced vowels ([\u0259 \u026a]) which occur only in their short versions. Although some vowels are strongly nasal, instances of distinctive nasality are rare. There are about nine diphthongs and a few triphthongs.  Most consonants have both palatal and non-palatal counterparts, including a very rich system of liquids, nasals and trills (i.e. three contrasting \"l\" sounds, three contrasting \"n\" sounds and three contrasting \"r\" sounds). The historically voiced stops [b d\u032a \u0261] have lost their voicing, so the phonemic contrast today is between unaspirated [p t\u032a k] and aspirated [p\u02b0 t\u032a\u02b0 k\u02b0]. In many dialects, these stops may however gain voicing through secondary articulation through a preceding nasal, for examples doras [t\u032a\u0254\u027e\u0259s\u032a] \"door\" but an doras \"the door\" as [\u0259n\u032a\u02e0 d\u032a\u0254\u027e\u0259s\u032a] or [\u0259 n\u032a\u02e0\u0254\u027e\u0259s\u032a].  In some fixed phrases, these changes are shown permanently, as the link with the base words has been lost, as in an-dr\u00e0sta \"now\", from an tr\u00e0th-sa \"this time\/period\".  In medial and final position, the aspirated stops are preaspirated rather than postaspirated.  Scottish Gaelic is an Indo-European language with an inflecting morphology, verb\u2013subject\u2013object word order and two grammatical genders.  Gaelic nouns inflect for four cases (nominative\/accusative, vocative, genitive and dative) and three numbers (singular, dual and plural).  They are also normally classed as either masculine or feminine. A small number of words that used to belong to the neuter class show some degree of gender confusion. For example, in some dialects am muir \"the sea\" behaves as a masculine noun in the nominative case, but as a feminine noun in the genitive (na mara).  Nouns are marked for case in a number of ways, most commonly involving various combinations of lenition, palatalisation and suffixation.  There are 12 irregular verbs.[111] Most other verbs follow a fully predictable paradigm, although polysyllabic verbs ending in laterals can deviate from this paradigm as they show syncopation.  There are:  Word order is strictly verb\u2013subject\u2013object, including questions, negative questions and negatives. Only a restricted set of preverb particles may occur before the verb.  The majority of the vocabulary of Scottish Gaelic is of Celtic origin. However, Gaelic contains substantially more words of non-Goidelic extraction than Irish. The main sources of loanwords into Gaelic are the Germanic languages English, Scots and Norse. Other sources include Latin, French and the Brittonic languages.[112]  Many direct Latin loanwords in Scottish Gaelic were adopted during the Old and Middle Irish (600 AD-1200 AD) stages of the language and are often terms related to Christianity. Latin is also the source of the days of the week Diluain (\"Monday\"), Dim\u00e0irt (Tuesday), Disathairne (\"Saturday\") and Did\u00f2mhnaich (\"Sunday\").[112]  The Brittonic languages Cumbric and Pictish were spoken in Scotland during the Early to High Middle Ages, and Scottish Gaelic has many Brittonic influences. Scottish Gaelic contains a number of apparently P-Celtic loanwords, but it is not always possible to disentangle P and Q Celtic words. However, some common words such as d\u00ecleab (\"legacy\"), monadh (mynydd; \"mountain\") and preas (prys; \"bush\") are transparently Brittonic in origin.[24]  Scottish Gaelic contains a number of words, principally toponymic elements, that are more closely aligned in their usage and sense with their Brittonic cognates than their Irish. This is indicative of the operation of a Brittonic substrate influence. Such items include:[113][114]  In common with other Indo-European languages, the neologisms coined for modern concepts are typically based on Greek or Latin, although often coming through English; television, for instance, becomes telebhisean and computer becomes coimpi\u00f9tar. Some speakers use an English word even if there is a Gaelic equivalent, applying the rules of Gaelic grammar. With verbs, for instance, they will simply add the verbal suffix (-eadh, or, in Lewis, -igeadh, as in, \"Tha mi a' watch eadh (Lewis, \"watch igeadh\") an telly\" (I am watching the television), instead of \"Tha mi a' coimhead air an telebhisean\". This phenomenon was described over 170 years ago, by the minister who compiled the account covering the parish of Stornoway in the New Statistical Account of Scotland, and examples can be found dating to the eighteenth century.[115] However, as Gaelic medium education grows in popularity, a newer generation of literate Gaels has become more familiar with modern Gaelic vocabulary.[citation needed]  Scottish Gaelic has also influenced the Scots language and English, particularly Scottish Standard English. Loanwords include: whisky, slogan, brogue, jilt, clan, galore, trousers, gob, as well as familiar elements of Scottish geography like ben (beinn), glen (gleann) and loch. Irish has also influenced Lowland Scots and English in Scotland, but it is not always easy to distinguish its influence from that of Scottish Gaelic.[112][page\u00a0needed]  Scottish Gaelic orthography is fairly regular; its standard was set by the 1767 New Testament. The 1981 Scottish Examination Board recommendations for Scottish Gaelic, the Gaelic Orthographic Conventions, were adopted by most publishers and agencies, although they remain controversial among some academics, most notably Ronald Black.[116]  The quality of consonants (broad or slender) is indicated by the vowels surrounding them. Slender (palatalised) consonants are surrounded by slender vowels (\u27e8e, i\u27e9), while broad (neutral or velarised) consonants are surrounded by broad vowels (\u27e8a, o, u\u27e9). The spelling rule known as caol ri caol agus leathann ri leathann (\"slender to slender and broad to broad\") requires that a word-medial consonant or consonant group followed by \u27e8i, e\u27e9 is preceded by \u27e8i, e\u27e9 and similarly, if followed by \u27e8a, o, u\u27e9 is preceded by \u27e8a, o, u\u27e9.  This rule sometimes leads to the insertion of a silent written vowel. For example, plurals in Gaelic are often formed with the suffix -an [\u0259n], for example, br\u00f2g [pr\u0254\u02d0k] (\"shoe\") \/ br\u00f2gan [pr\u0254\u02d0k\u0259n] (\"shoes\"). But because of the spelling rule, the suffix is spelled -\u27e8ean\u27e9 (but pronounced the same, [\u0259n]) after a slender consonant, as in muinntir [m\u026fi\u032f\u0272t\u02b2\u026ar\u02b2] (\"[a] people\") \/ muinntirean [m\u026fi\u032f\u0272t\u02b2\u026ar\u02b2\u0259n] (\"peoples\") where \u27e8e\u27e9 is purely a graphic vowel inserted to conform with the spelling rule because \u27e8i\u27e9 precedes the \u27e8r\u27e9.  Unstressed vowels omitted in speech can be omitted in informal writing, e.g. Tha mi an d\u00f2chas. (\"I hope.\") > Tha mi 'n d\u00f2chas.  Scots English orthographic rules have also been used at various times in Gaelic writing. Notable examples of Gaelic verse composed in this manner are the Book of the Dean of Lismore and the Fernaig manuscript.  The Ogham writing system was used in Ireland to write Primitive Irish and Old Irish until it was supplanted by the Latin script in the 5th century CE in Ireland.[117] In Scotland, the majority of Ogham inscriptions are in Pictish but a number of Goidelic Ogham inscriptions also exist, such as the Giogha Stone which bears the inscription VICULA MAQ CUGINI 'Viqula, son of Comginus',[118] with Goidelic MAQ (modern mac 'son') rather than Brythonic MAB (cf. modern Welsh mab 'son').  The Insular script was used both in Ireland and Scotland but had largely disappeared in Scotland by the 16th century. It consisted of the same 18 letters still in modern use \u27e8a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, l, m, n, o, p, r, s, t, u\u27e9.[119][120] and generally did not contain \u27e8j, k, q, v, w, x, y, z\u27e9.  In addition to the base letters, vowels in the Insular script could be accented with an acute accent (\u27e8\u00e1, \u00e9, \u00ed, \u00f3, \u00fa\u27e9 to indicate length. The overdot was used to indicate lenition of \u27e8\u1e1f, \u1e61\u27e9, while the following \u27e8h\u27e9 was used for \u27e8ch, ph, th\u27e9. The lenition of other letters was not generally indicated initially but eventually the two methods were used in parallel to represent the lenition of any consonant and competed with each other until the standard practice became to use the overdot in the Insular Script and the following \u27e8h\u27e9 in Roman type, i.e. \u27e8\u1e03, \u010b, \u1e0b, \u1e1f, \u0121, \u1e41, \u1e57, \u1e61, \u1e6b\u27e9 are equivalent to \u27e8bh, ch, dh, fh, gh, mh, ph, sh, th\u27e9. The use of Gaelic type and the overdot today is restricted to decorative usages.  Letters with an overdot have been available since Unicode 5.0 .[121]  The modern Scottish Gaelic alphabet has 18 letters: \u27e8a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, l, m, n, o, p, r, s, t, u\u27e9. \u27e8h\u27e9 is mostly used to indicate lenition of a consonant. The letters of the alphabet were traditionally named after trees, but this custom has fallen out of use.  Long vowels are marked with a grave accent (\u27e8\u00e0, \u00e8, \u00ec, \u00f2, \u00f9\u27e9), indicated through digraphs (e.g. \u27e8ao\u27e9 for [\u026f\u02d0]) or conditioned by certain consonant environments (e.g. \u27e8u\u27e9 preceding a non-intervocalic \u27e8nn\u27e9 is [u\u02d0]). Traditionally the acute accent was used on \u27e8\u00e1, \u00e9, \u00f3\u27e9 to represent long close-mid vowels, but the spelling reforms replaced it with the grave accent.[108]  Certain 18th century sources used only an acute accent along the lines of Irish, such as in the writings of Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair (1741\u201351) and the earliest editions (1768\u201390) of Duncan Ban MacIntyre.[122]  Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Scottish Gaelic:   Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in English:  Note: Items in brackets denote archaic, dialectal or regional variant forms "},{"title":"History of rugby league","content":"  The history of rugby league as a separate form of rugby football goes back to 1895 in Huddersfield, West Riding of Yorkshire when the Northern Rugby Football Union broke away from England's established Rugby Football Union to administer its own separate competition.[3] Similar schisms occurred later in Australia and New Zealand in 1907. Gradually the rugby played in these breakaway competitions evolved into a distinctly separate sport that took its name from the professional leagues that administered it. Rugby league in England went on to set attendance and player payment records and rugby league in Australia became the most watched sport on television. The game also developed a significant place in the culture of France, New Zealand and several other Pacific Island nations, such as Papua New Guinea, where it has become the national sport.  Although many forms of football had been played across the world, it was only during the second half of the 19th century that these games began to be codified. In 1871, English clubs playing the version of football played at Rugby School, which involved much more handling of the ball than in association football, met to form the Rugby Football Union. Many new rugby clubs were formed, and it was in the Northern English counties of Lancashire and Yorkshire that the game really took hold. Here rugby was largely a working class game, whilst the south eastern clubs were largely middle class.  Rugby spread to Australasia, especially the cities of Sydney, Brisbane, Christchurch and Auckland. Here too there was a clear divide between the working and more affluent upper-class players.  The strength of support for rugby grew over the following years, and large paying crowds were attracted to major matches, particular in Yorkshire, where matches in the Yorkshire Cup (T'owd Tin Pot) soon became major events. England teams of the era were dominated by Lancashire and Yorkshire players. However these players were forbidden to earn any of the spoils of this newly-rich game. Predominantly working class teams found it difficult to play to their full potential because in many cases their time to play and to train was limited by the need to earn a wage. A further limit on the playing ability of working class teams was that working class players had to be careful how hard they played. If injured, they had to pay their own medical bills and possibly take time off work, which for a man earning a weekly wage could easily lead to financial hardship.  In 1892, charges of professionalism were laid against rugby football clubs in Bradford and Leeds, both in Yorkshire, after they compensated players for missing work. This was despite the fact that the English Rugby Football Union (RFU) was allowing other players to be paid, such as the 1888 British Isles team that toured Australia, and the account of Harry Hamill of his payments to represent New South Wales (NSW) against England in 1904.  In 1893 Yorkshire clubs complained that southern clubs were over-represented on the RFU committee and that committee meetings were held in London at times that made it difficult for northern members to attend. By implication they were arguing that this affected the RFU's decisions on the issue of \"broken time\" payments (as compensation for the loss of income) to the detriment of northern clubs, who made up the majority of English rugby clubs. Payment for broken time was a proposal put forward by Yorkshire clubs that would allow players to receive up to six shillings (30p) (equivalent to \u00a335 in present-day terms)[4] when they missed work because of match commitments. The idea was voted down by the RFU.  In August 1893, Huddersfield signed star players George Boak and John 'Jock' Forsyth from Carlisle-based club, Cummersdale Hornets.[5] The transfer was sudden and both men were summoned to appear before Carlisle Magistrates' Court for leaving their jobs without giving proper notice.[6] Huddersfield was also accused of offering cash inducements for the players to move clubs contrary to the strict rules of the RFU. After an investigation, Huddersfield eventually received a long suspension from playing matches.  The severity of the punishments for \"broken time\" payments and their widespread application to northern clubs and players contributed to a growing sense of frustration and absence of fair play. Meanwhile, there was an obvious comparison with the professional Football League which had been formed in 1888, comprising 12 association football clubs, six of whom were from Northern England. In this environment, the next logical step was for the northern rugby clubs to form their own professional league.  On 27 August 1895, as a result of an emergency meeting in Manchester, prominent Lancashire clubs Broughton Rangers, Leigh, Oldham, Rochdale Hornets, St. Helens, Tyldesley, Warrington, Widnes and Wigan declared that they would support their Yorkshire colleagues in their proposal to form a Northern Union.  For several years past, the Yorkshire clubs have been endeavouring to secure a sufficient relaxation of the laws to permit the payment to players of actual out of pocket expenses (including loss of wages) incurred whilst playing for their clubs, but every proposition to that effect has been successfully combatted by the Southern clubs, who object to the innovation as being the introduction of the thin end of professionalism pure and simple. And this is really the gist of the whole matter.  New Zealand's Observer Newspaper, 26 October 1895[7] Two days later, on 29 August 1895, representatives of twenty-two clubs met in the George Hotel, Huddersfield, to form the Northern Rugby Football Union, usually called the Northern Union (NU). This was effectively the birth of rugby league, the name adopted by the sport in 1922.[8] Twenty clubs had agreed to resign from the Rugby Union, but Dewsbury felt unable to comply with the decision. The Cheshire club, Stockport, had telegraphed the meeting requesting admission to the new organisation and was duly accepted with a second Cheshire club, Runcorn, admitted at the next meeting.  The twenty-two clubs and their years of foundation were Batley 1880; Bradford 1863; Brighouse Rangers 1878; Broughton Rangers 1877; Halifax 1873; Huddersfield FC 1864; Hull F.C. 1865; Hunslet 1883; Leeds 1870; Leigh 1878; Liversedge 1877; Manningham 1876; Oldham 1876; Rochdale Hornets 1871; Runcorn 1895; Stockport 1895; St Helens 1873; Tyldesley 1879; Wakefield Trinity 1873; Warrington 1876; Widnes 1875; and Wigan 1872.  The rugby union authorities took drastic action, issuing sanctions against clubs, players and officials involved in the new organisation. This extended even to amateurs who played with or against Northern Union sides. Consequently, northern clubs that existed purely for social and recreational rugby began to affiliate to the Northern Union, whilst retaining amateur status. By 1904 the new body had more clubs affiliated to it than the RFU.  The separate Lancashire and Yorkshire competitions of the NRFU merged in 1901, forming the Northern Rugby Football League. Also in 1901, James Lomas became the first \u00a3100 transfer, from Bramley to Salford. The NRFU became the Northern Rugby Football League in the summer of 1922.  Similar schisms in football were threatened by the formations of the British Football Association in 1884 and the Amateur Football Association in 1907, but were averted.  The historic events that led to the 1895 rugby split were the subject of Mick Martin's play Broken Time, the first dramatic treatment of rugby league.[9]  The first international rugby league match took place in 1904 between England and an Other nationalities team, mostly made up of Welsh players.[10]  Initially the Northern Union continued to play under existing RFU laws. The first minor change (awarding a penalty for a deliberate knock-on) was introduced during the first season of the game. Other new laws were gradually introduced until, by the arrival of the All Golds in 1907 the major differences between the games had been introduced. These major differences were:  See: Rugby league gameplay for more on the current game.  During this period the Northern Union began to develop the British game's major tournaments. The league championship, after initially being played as one competition, was split into two sections, the Lancashire and Yorkshire leagues, with only a limited number of inter-county games. This necessitated a play-off structure to determine the overall champions. A nationwide cup, the Challenge Cup was introduced, and soon became the biggest draw in the sport. Finally, in 1905, the Lancashire and Yorkshire Cups were introduced, thus completing a structure that was to last until the 1960s. There were therefore four trophies on offer to any one club, and the \"Holy Grail\" was to win \"All Four Cups\".  As it became obvious that two codes of rugby were going to co-exist for the foreseeable future, those interested in the game needed to be able to distinguish between them. It became customary to describe those teams affiliated to the NU as 'playing in the league' hence \"rugby league\" while those which remained affiliated to the RFU (who did not play in a league) as playing \"rugby union\".  In 1905, as New Zealand's rugby union team, the All Blacks, toured Britain, they witnessed first-hand the growing popularity of the Northern Union games. In 1906, All Black George William Smith, while on his way home, met an Australian entrepreneur, J. J. Giltinan to discuss the potential of professional rugby in Australasia.  In the meantime, a less-well known New Zealand rugby union player, Albert Henry Baskerville (or Baskiville), was about to recruit a group of players for a professional tour of Great Britain. It is believed that Baskerville first became aware of the profits to be made from such a venture while he was working at the Wellington Post Office in 1906: a colleague had a coughing fit and dropped a British newspaper. Baskerville picked it up and noticed a report about a Northern Union match that over 40,000 people had attended. Baskerville wrote to the NRFU asking if they would host a New Zealand touring party. George Smith learned of Baskerville's activities and they joined forces to recruit a team.  All Golds tour  When the All Golds stopped off in Australia, three games were played at the Sydney Showground, against a professional NSW rugby team. These games were played under rugby union laws, as no copies of the Northern Union laws were available. Baskerville was greatly impressed by Dally Messenger, and persuaded him to join the touring party. For this reason, the All Golds are sometimes known as Australasia, rather than New Zealand, although Messenger was the only Australian in the touring team.  The All Golds arrived in Britain late in 1907 having never even seen a match played under the new Northern Union laws. They undertook a week's intensive coaching in Leeds to bring them up to speed, and after playing a number of touring matches the first true rugby league test was played, with the team going down 8\u20139 to Wales in Aberdare on 1 January 1908. The All Golds gained revenge however, defeating the full Great Britain side in two of the three Test matches, which were played at Leeds, Chelsea and Cheltenham; a surprising choice of venues given rugby league's northern base. The tour was a great success, and gave a much needed boost to the game in Britain, which was struggling financially against the rise of association football.  Baskerville died from illness on the Australian leg of the tour, but the professional rugby movement lived on, pushing forward in New Zealand despite strong opposition from the rugby union establishment.  Early setbacks for the game in New Zealand  Apart from the blow presented by the sudden and premature death of Baskerville, other difficulties would soon trouble the game in New Zealand. In some ways, the All Golds were too successful for the good of New Zealand rugby league, as many team members soon accepted lucrative contracts with British clubs. Baskerville's game would soon establish a strong following, especially in Auckland, but rugby union's strong grassroots organisation and finances in New Zealand\u2014its \"veiled professionalism\" in the eyes of many observers at the time\u2014meant that rugby league was unable to become quite as dominant there as in some regions of Australia and England.  ...the game is but a recreation, and no recreation should become a business. But a man is perfectly justified in fortifying himself against being out of pocket when following recreative purposes. There can be no valid objection to a player being paid his actual out-of-pocket purposes while on tour\u2014provided, of course, this course is not abused. If the Northern Union game is to be popularised in New Zealand, its promoters must make such provisions as will keep it free from such abuses. It must be entirely free from straight-out bastard professionalism. In the Australian rugby stronghold of Sydney, issues of class and professionalism were beginning to cause friction. Rumours and claims of \"shamateurism\" (see Amateur sports) in the New South Wales Rugby Union were circulating. The growing tension was exacerbated by an incident in 1907, when a working class player, Alex Burdon, broke his arm while playing for the New South Wales team, and received no compensation for his time off work.  George Smith cabled a friend in Sydney to enquire whether there might be any support for a tour by his New Zealand professional team. Word reached Giltinan, who took great interest. Giltinan announced that he had invited Baskerville's team to play three matches in Sydney. The Australian press responded by dubbing the travelling New Zealand team \"All Golds\", a sardonic play on the nickname of the existing amateur New Zealand rugby team, the \"All Blacks\" and the supposed \"mercenary\" nature of the new code. The games were a great success; leaving the rugby rebels of Australia with much needed funds which soon proved to be vital for rugby league in Australia.  A meeting was held at Bateman's Crystal Hotel in Sydney on 8 August 1907, to organise professional rugby in Australia. Giltinan, Burdon and the Test cricketer Victor Trumper were among those who attended. The meeting resolved that a \"New South Wales Rugby Football League\" (NSWRFL) should be formed, to play the Northern Union rules. This was the first time that the words \"rugby\" and \"league\" were used in the name of an Australian organising body. Players were soon recruited for the new game; despite the threat of immediate and lifetime expulsion from the New South Wales Rugby Union. The NSWRFL managed to recruit Herbert \"Dally\" Messenger, the most famous rugby player in Sydney at the time.  The first season of the NSWRFL competition was played in 1908, and has continued to be played every year since (despite changes in administration and name), eventually going national and becoming the world's premier rugby football club competition.  That [the touring New Zealand side] is a professional team makes little difference to the crowd of Sydney people who want to see football. That it plays the Northern Union game is in its favour with the crowd. The Sydney newspapers are, generally speaking, supporters of the Rugby Union game. Nevertheless, their notices have been most favourable. \"A brilliant game.\" \"Intense excitement.\" \"The crowd roared itself hoarse.\" \"One of the most exciting games ever seen in Sydney.\" In September 1909, when the new \"Northern Union\" code was still in its infancy in Australia, a match between the Kangaroos and the Wallabies was played before a crowd of around 20,000, with the Rugby League side winning 29\u201326.[13] That year rugby union and rugby league had similar gate receipts. By 1910 league's had doubled and by 1913 rugby union's receipts were less than 10% of its competitors'. Union had to relinquish leases on major sporting grounds, with most being taken over by rugby league.[14]  The All Golds tour also served to kick start the game in the Australian state of Queensland, the great rival of NSW in rugby. On 16 May 1908, the returning New Zealanders played a hastily assembled Queensland team in Brisbane. Observers of the new game were shocked when Albert Baskerville fell ill in Brisbane and died of pneumonia. Test series between Great Britain and New Zealand are played for the Baskerville Shield, named in his memory.  A Queensland Rugby Football Association was founded, and in early July, informal club games were played in Brisbane. Later that month there were three representative games against NSW, and these acted as selection trials for a national team. The first game was also notable for a Queensland tackle which rendered one NSW player, Ed \"Son\" Fry, completely naked from the waist down\u2014an event which did not stop him from scoring a try.  The Brisbane Rugby League premiership began in 1909. On 8 May the first match was played in Brisbane between Norths and Souths before a handful of spectators at the Gabba.[15]  By the 1920s the Queensland Rugby League had established itself as a force to rival the NSWRL.  Also in 1908, the Australian rugby union team returned from a tour of the British Isles, for which the team had received three shillings a day, for out-of-pocket expenses. Thirteen of the players immediately joined rugby league teams. By the northern winter of 1908\u201309, an Australian touring party was heading for Great Britain, and the test series was dubbed \"The Ashes\" by the press, in imitation of The Ashes cricket matches, contested by Australia and England.  Later in 1909, when New Zealand toured Australia, the home team's jersey featured a kangaroo for the first time, giving them the enduring nickname of \"The Kangaroos\".  The early years of the 20th century also saw attempts to establish the game in Wales, with several teams being formed in the country. None of these ventures lasted long, however Wales remained a source of playing talent for rugby league. Over the years many hundreds of Welsh rugby union players \"moved north\" to the major English clubs, attracted by the opportunity to earn money playing rugby. (It was not until rugby union officially allowed professionalism, in the late 20th century that this supply of talent ceased.)  The 1910 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand, the first ever, took place after the 1909\u201310 Northern Rugby Football Union season and featured a number of Welsh former rugby union internationals. Several Wallabies players changed codes to play against this touring team, which was anticipated to be one of the best sides ever to visit Australasia.  The Rugby League matches continue to command more public interest than the Union. In Australasia, the game centred around local, regional or statewide leagues, and there were no national competitions in either country until late in the 20th century. In both Australia and New Zealand, club championships were based on one set of home and away matches leading to a play-off, rather than the multiplicity of trophies available to British clubs. Rugby league quickly took over from rugby union as the most popular form of football in New South Wales and Queensland. The rest of the country was already dominated by Australian rules football. The amateur code still held sway in New Zealand, although the emergence of rugby league meant that it was no longer unrivalled in popularity.  Sport in general suffered as a result of the First World War, and rugby league was no exception. In Britain, the government discouraged all professional sports, and the major competitions were abandoned. In Australia, the situation was slightly less serious, and rugby league continued. The rugby union authorities opted to suspend play throughout the war, and this decision is often cited as one of the prime reasons for the traditional dominance of rugby league over rugby union in Australia. [citation needed]  Although the clubs continued to play, many of them were short of players due to the fighting. In 1917, Australia's first rugby league club, the Glebe \"Dirty Reds\" (founded on 9 January 1908), unleashed controversy when it fielded a player named Dan \"Laddo\" Davies. Local rivals Annandale protested that Davies lived within their designated recruiting area. Glebe were deducted two competition points and Davies received a lifetime ban. Many Glebe players already believed the NSWRL was biased against them and they went on strike; the league responded by suspending the first grade team until the following April. Davies returned to his native Newcastle, where his previous club, Western Suburbs\u2014not to be confused with the Sydney club of the same name\u2014sought to use him in the local league. They tried repeatedly to have Davies' suspension lifted, but the NSWRL refused. When Western Suburbs fielded him in a match the NSWRL disqualified most of the local officials for a year. Disgruntled Novocastrians formed a breakaway competition, which lasted until 1919. The fortunes of Glebe, both on the field and financially, did not improve greatly after the Davies affair, and it was expelled from the main NSWRL competition in 1929.  In November 1921 in England, the first \u00a31,000 transfer fee took winger Harold Buck from Hunslet to Leeds.  Internationally, the game had settled into a steady pattern of alternating tours, with either Australia or New Zealand visiting Britain once every two years, and Britain reciprocating in the southern hemisphere. The war had intervened, but the schedule was picked up again after hostilities ceased.  An increasing number of Australian and New Zealand players headed for the bigger pay packets on offer in England, many of them destined never to be seen again on the playing fields of their home countries.  In 1933 a proposed hybrid sport of rugby league and Australian rules football was trialled only once.  For many years, the rugby union authorities had suspected that the French rugby union was abusing the idea of amateurism, and in the early 1930s the French Rugby Union was suspended from playing against the other nations. In 1932 the first rugby league match under floodlights is played between Leeds and Wigan at White City in London.[17] Following development work by both Harry Sunderland (on behalf of the Australian Rugby League) and the Rugby Football League based in England, the Australian and Great British Test teams played an exhibition game at Stade Pershing in Paris in late December 1933. The French Rugby League was formed on 6 April 1934.[18]  Looking round for an alternative, many French players turned to rugby league, which soon became the dominant game in France, particularly in the south west of the country. The arrival of a French team on the international scene allowed more variety in the touring pattern, and also for the introduction of a European Championship.  During the Second World War, the British government took a more benign view of professional sports, viewing them as a vital aid to public morale. Although normal leagues were suspended, a War Emergency League was established, with clubs playing separate Yorkshire and Lancashire sections to reduce the need for travel. This period also saw a temporary relaxation of the regulations prohibiting rugby union players from contact with rugby league. In an extraordinary development a team representing rugby league met a rugby union equivalent in two matches, held to raise money for the Red Cross. Both games were held under rugby union rules; both were won by the rugby league side.  In Australia, the war years produced large crowds, and financially at least, the sport did not suffer the hardships endured during the First World War. Nonetheless, the loss of many young men in fighting undoubtedly weakened the talent pool available.  The defeat of France had serious implications for rugby league in France. The Vichy regime banned rugby league and forced players, clubs and officials to switch codes to union. Assets of the rugby league and its clubs were handed over to union.  The consequences of this action still reverberate; the assets were never returned, and although the ban on rugby league was lifted, it was prevented from calling itself rugby from 1949 to the mid-1980s, having to use the name Jeu \u00e0 Treize (Game of Thirteen, in reference to the number of players in a rugby league side).  The rules of the sport had continued to evolve, and until the 1940s there was no world governing body to oversee this and ensure consistency. Negotiations between the respective governing bodies were required to fix rules to be used for tours, though generally the other nations took their lead from the British authorities. For example, the field goal was banned by the New South Wales Rugby League in 1922, however this method of scoring was not officially recognised as being removed from the game until 1950, when the British authorities banned it.[19]  This situation endured until 1948, when at the instigation of the French, the Rugby League International Federation (RLIF) was formed at a meeting on 25 January 1948 in Bordeaux. The 1947\u201348 Northern Rugby Football League season's Challenge Cup Final was the first rugby league match to be televised.[17] All spectator sports in the United Kingdom experienced a surge in interest in the years following the end of World War II and rugby league boomed.[20] Large crowds came to be expected as the norm for a period of around 20 years. The total crowds for the British season hit a record in 1949\u201350, when over 69.8\u00a0million paying customers attended all matches.[21] On Saturday 10 November 1951 the first televised international rugby league match was broadcast from Station Road, Swinton, where Great Britain met New Zealand in the second Test of that 1951 series.  The surge in public interest in the sport was further demonstrated by the 1954 Challenge Cup Final Replay between Halifax and Warrington, held at Odsal Stadium, Bradford on Wednesday, 5 May 1954. The officially recorded attendance was at 102,569 (a record for a single match of rugby league that stood until 107,999 watched Melbourne Storm defeat St George Illawarra Dragons at Stadium Australia in 1999). It is estimated that a further 20,000 spectators were present, as many got in free after a section of fencing collapsed. Warrington beat Halifax 8\u20134.  This period also saw growth in crowds in Australia, New Zealand and France. This was a golden age for the French, who led by the incomparable Puig Aubert, travelled to Australia and defeated their host in a three test series in 1951. On their return to France the victorious team were greeted by an estimated 100,000 fans in Marseille. They repeated the feat in France 1952\u201353 and again in Australia in 1955.  The French were the driving force behind the staging of the first Rugby League World Cup (also the first tournament to be officially known as the \"Rugby World Cup\") in 1954. This competition has been held intermittently since then, in a variety of formats. Unlike many other sports the World Cup has never really been the pinnacle of the international game, that honour falling to international test series such as the Ashes.  In 1956, the state government of New South Wales legalised the playing of poker machines (\"pokies\") in profit clubs, and this rapidly became the major source of income for NSW \"leagues clubs\", some of which became palatial \"homes away from home\" for their supporters. The pokie windfall stemmed the steady trickle of Australian players to the better-financed clubs in England, and led to increased recruiting of rugby union and league players from Queensland and overseas by New South Welsh clubs. Within the space of several years, the Sydney-based league had come to dominate the code within Australia. The large profits accrued from gambling have always been controversial; many questioned the morality of such an income stream and felt that it would inevitably lead to financial turmoil and scandal.  1961 saw the first televised game of rugby league in Australia.[22] In the UK live coverage of professional rugby league began in the early 1960s, exposing the game to a national audience.[23] David Attenborough, then controller of BBC2, made the decision to screen rugby league games from a new competition specially designed for evening televising, the BBC2 Television Floodlit Trophy. Although it was widely seen as a gimmick, it proved a success, and rugby league has featured on television ever since, to the point where (like most sports) income from selling broadcasting rights is the single greatest source of revenue for the game. In Australia the 1967 NSWRFL season's grand final became the first football grand final of any code to be televised live in Australia. The Nine Network had paid $5,000 for the broadcasting rights.[24]  This period also saw further alterations to the rules of the sport. In 1964 substitutes were allowed for the first time, but only for players injured before half-time. In 1966 limited tackles were introduced. In 1967 professional matches were first allowed on Sundays. Also this year the number of times a team could retain possession after a play-the-ball was limited to four tackles.[25] The concept of limited tackles had existed in American football since the 1880s, and it was hoped that this would encourage more attacking play, and prevent teams from simply playing to maintain possession of the ball at all costs. Although successful in this respect, it was felt that four tackles did not give sufficient time to develop an attack, with play often being characterised by pure panic. In 1971, the number of tackles allowed was increased to six, and has remained so ever since. That year the value of field goals was reduced as well, from 2 to 1.[25]  In Britain's 1971\u201372 season, sponsors first entered the game: brewers Joshua Tetley and cigarette brand John Player. In 1976 Sydney club Eastern Suburbs set a precedent with a major sponsor, City Ford appearing on their jersey.  In 1977 Australian forward Graham Olling made headlines when he became the first rugby league player to admit to taking anabolic steroids, which at the time were not illegal in the sport.[26]  In 1980 the first State of Origin match was played in Australia. This pitted teams representative of Queensland and New South Wales against each other. Although matches between the two had taken place for many years, the origin concept (borrowed from Australian rules football) meant that for the first time players were selected based on where they first played the game, rather than where they were currently playing. This had an immediate effect, evening up the competition, which had come to be dominated by New South Wales because of the financial strength of the Sydney clubs, and rousing greater pride in spectators as their players were considered more truly representative of their respective states. State of Origin matches are now some of the biggest and most keenly fought contests in Australian sport.  The 1980s also saw attempts to improve rugby league's popularity outside its traditional geographical boundaries. In Great Britain a new team from London (Fulham) was admitted to the professional ranks. In Australia, the first sides from outside the Sydney metropolitan area entered the top-flight competition in. In 1982 the Illawarra Steelers (based in Wollongong) and the Canberra Raiders (based in the national capital, Canberra) entered the competition. As a result of a lucrative illegal betting market having developed since the Second World War, FootyTAB was founded in 1983 to develop legal betting on rugby league, and was a resounding success.  In 1981 the 'Sin Bin' rule was introduced in rugby league in Australia. Newtown hooker Barry Jensen became the first player sent there. In 1983 the number of points awarded for scoring a try increased from three to four. Also in 1983, the Australian ABC-TV current affairs programme Four Corners, aired an episode entitled \"The Big League\". The programme was to have repercussions throughout Australian sport, and in the wider community. Reporter Chris Masters (the brother of league identity Roy Masters) described allegations of corruption within the NSWRL, including suggestions that officials were siphoning funds from particular clubs and international matches while players and spectators endured sub-standard facilities. As a result of the programme, a Royal Commission (the Street Royal Commission) was called. It led to the New South Wales chief magistrate Murray Farquhar being jailed, the end of NSWRL president Kevin Humphreys' career and the ABC being sued for libel by NSW State Premier, Neville Wran (who eventually settled out of court). Masters, Four Corners and the commission are widely credited with widespread improvements in the administration of rugby league in Australia.  In the late 1980s, rugby league competitions were launched or continued to expand in Russia, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific islands.  A further expansion to the NSWRL in 1988 saw the first Queensland teams added to the league: Brisbane Broncos and Gold Coast Giants, as well as another team from outside Sydney, Newcastle Knights. Expansion occurred again in 1995, with the addition to the League of teams from Perth, Townsville and Auckland.  \"Thirteen-man rugby league has shown itself to be a faster, more open game of better athletes than the other code. Rugby union is trying to negotiate its own escape from amateurism, with some officials admitting that the game is too slow, the laws too convoluted to attract a larger TV following.\" In 1995 Ian Roberts became the first high-profile Australian sports person and first rugby footballer in the world to come out to the public as gay.[28]  The 1990s saw the importance of television income to the sport continue to rise, and a battle for control of television rights led to the infamous Super League war, which saw the game split between rival competitions. This event affected the sport across the world during the middle of decade, and the damage done is only now being undone.  While the Super League war was being fought in Australia, Rupert Murdoch approached the English clubs with a view to forming a Super League, primarily as a way to gain the upper hand during his battle with Kerry Packer for broadcasting rights for the sport in Australia. A large sum of money from News Corporation's UK subsidiary, BSkyB, helped fund the proposal. The new competition got under way in 1996. As part of the deal, rugby league switched from a winter to a summer season. The British, Australian and New Zealand seasons are now played concurrently from March to October, and major international tournaments are now largely played in November. The French, however, have continued to play a winter season.  After the 1997 season in Australia the Super League war came to an end, with News International and the Australian Rugby League agreeing to merge their competitions to create the National Rugby League, which commenced in 1998. The first ever team from Victoria, the Melbourne Storm entered the competition. Several clubs were either forced to merge (e.g. St. George Dragons and Illawarra Steelers became St George Illawarra Dragons), or folded. The omission of South Sydney Rabbitohs, one of the founding members of the original NSWRL, led to mass protests. Although Souths did not participate in the NRL during 2000 and 2001, a Federal Court decision in July 2001 paved the way for them to return to the league in 2002.  In 1995, rugby union went professional, and those who had long derided rugby league as merely a professional version of that game were soon predicting the demise of the sport. The Super League war, the financial problems of the 2000 Rugby League World Cup and the signing of several high-profile rugby league stars by the union game gave ammunition to this claim.  With the professionalism of rugby union, several high-profile league players changed codes, with varying degrees of success. Australian RU administrators appeared to be targeting league internationals when in 2001\/02 Kangaroos Wendell Sailor, Mat Rogers and Lote Tuqiri all switched and soon represented the Wallabies. Other high-profile players, such as Jason Robinson, Iestyn Harris and Henry Paul followed. However press claims at the time that the \"flood-gates\" had opened proved to be more sensational than portentous. By the end of the decade, the flow of league players moving on big-money contracts to union seemed to have stabilised, and in fact in many cases this actually proved to be positive for rugby league, with the money gained from transfer fees being used to fund expansion and additional youth development in Britain and with many of the star crossover players returning to rugby league in Australia.  The game needs to be aware of it and take steps to ensure that it doesn't become a flood. We need to ensure we can pay our senior players as much as we can and we need to make sure our international football is up to scratch. In Britain, the ending of discrimination against rugby league resulting from professionalism in rugby union led to an increase in numbers in the amateur game, with many rugby union amateurs keen to try out the other code. In 2004 the Rugby Football League was able to report a return to profitability, a reunified structure and a 94% increase in registered players in just two years.[30]  In 2008, rugby league held its first World Cup since the disastrous 2000 tournament. The 2008 competition was heralded as a great success, turning a significant profit, and was generally seen as a major step forwards in the development of the international game. In addition, the Rugby League European Federation was set up during the decade and as a result the game saw massive advances in both the quality and quantity of international competition. The game in France saw a renaissance, largely as a result of the Catalans Dragons entry into Super League, while large advances were made in other countries such as Wales and New Zealand, who finished the decade as world champions.  In Australia in 2009, rugby league's popularity was confirmed as it had the highest official television ratings figures of any sporting event.[31]  The 2013 Rugby League World Cup was held in Europe, with the final played at England's Old Trafford in front of 74,468, the largest crowd to attend an international fixture.[32]  The 2014 National Rugby League Grand Final was the highest rated television show for the year in Australia.[33]  In 2015, the league went through a structure change with promotion and relegation reintroduced between Super League and the Championship. It also saw rugby league pull 4 of the top 5 highest rated television broadcasts in Australia.[34]  In 2017 rugby league saw its first professional club outside of Europe or Australasia\/Oceania when the Canadian side Toronto Wolfpack entered the British Rugby League system in the third division. Toronto won League One in their first season and won promotion to the Championship, the second tier of British Rugby League for 2018. As of October 2018, Toronto's owner stated his intention of setting up a new franchise in Canada, whilst a New York City based team expressed their interest to join Toronto in the British rugby league system. "},{"title":"North Sea","content":"    Download coordinates as:  The North Sea lies between Great Britain, Denmark, Norway, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and France. An epeiric sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the Atlantic Ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than 970 kilometres (600\u00a0mi) long and 580 kilometres (360\u00a0mi) wide, covering 570,000 square kilometres (220,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).  It hosts key north European shipping lanes and is a major fishery. The coast is a popular destination for recreation and tourism in bordering countries, and a rich source of energy resources, including wind and wave power.  The North Sea has featured prominently in geopolitical and military affairs, particularly in Northern Europe, from the Middle Ages to the modern era. It was also important globally through the power northern Europeans projected worldwide during much of the Middle Ages and into the modern era. The North Sea was the centre of the Vikings' rise. The Hanseatic League, the Dutch Republic, and the British each sought to gain command of the North Sea and access to the world's markets and resources. As Germany's only outlet to the ocean, the North Sea was strategically important through both world wars.  The coast has diverse geology and geography. In the north, deep fjords and sheer cliffs mark much of its Norwegian and Scottish coastlines respectively, whereas in the south, the coast consists mainly of sandy beaches, estuaries of long rivers and wide mudflats. Due to the dense population, heavy industrialisation, and intense use of the sea and the area surrounding it, various environmental issues affect the sea's ecosystems. Adverse environmental issues\u00a0\u2013 commonly including overfishing, industrial and agricultural runoff, dredging, and dumping, among others\u00a0\u2013  have led to several efforts to prevent degradation and to safeguard long-term economic benefits.  The North Sea is bounded by the Orkney Islands and east coast of Great Britain to the west[1] and the northern and central European mainland to the east and south, including Norway, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France.[2] In the southwest, beyond the Straits of Dover, the North Sea becomes the English Channel connecting to the Atlantic Ocean.[1][2] In the east, it connects to the Baltic Sea via the Skagerrak and Kattegat,[2] narrow straits that separate Denmark from Norway and Sweden respectively.[1] In the north it is bordered by the Shetland Islands, and connects with the Norwegian Sea, which is a marginal sea in the Arctic Ocean.[1][3]  The North Sea is more than 970 kilometres (600\u00a0mi) long and 580 kilometres (360\u00a0mi) wide, with an area of 750,000 square kilometres (290,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and a volume of 54,000 cubic kilometres (13,000\u00a0cu\u00a0mi).[4] Around the edges of the North Sea are sizeable islands and archipelagos, including Shetland, Orkney, and the Frisian Islands.[2] The North Sea receives freshwater from a number of European continental watersheds, as well as the British Isles. A large part of the European drainage basin empties into the North Sea, including water from the Baltic Sea. The largest and most important rivers flowing into the North Sea are the Elbe and the Rhine \u2013 Meuse.[5] Around 185\u00a0million people live in the catchment area of the rivers discharging into the North Sea encompassing some highly industrialized areas.[6]  For the most part, the sea lies on the European continental shelf with a mean depth of 90 metres (300\u00a0ft).[1][7] The only exception is the Norwegian trench, which extends parallel to the Norwegian shoreline from Oslo to an area north of Bergen.[1] It is between 20 and 30 kilometres (12 and 19\u00a0mi) wide and has a maximum depth of 725 metres (2,379\u00a0ft).[8]  The Dogger Bank, a vast moraine, or accumulation of unconsolidated glacial debris, rises to a mere 15 to 30\u00a0m (50 to 100\u00a0ft) below the surface.[9][10] This feature has produced the finest fishing location of the North Sea.[1] The Long Forties and the Broad Fourteens are large areas with roughly uniform depth in fathoms (forty fathoms and fourteen fathoms or 73 and 26\u00a0m or 240 and 85\u00a0ft deep, respectively). These great banks and others make the North Sea particularly hazardous to navigate,[11] which has been alleviated by the implementation of satellite navigation systems.[12] The Devil's Hole lies 320 kilometres (200\u00a0mi) east of Dundee, Scotland. The feature is a series of asymmetrical trenches between 20 and 30 kilometres (12 and 19\u00a0mi) long, one and two kilometres (0.6 and 1.2\u00a0mi) wide and up to 230 metres (750\u00a0ft) deep.[13]  Other areas which are less deep are Cleaver Bank, Fisher Bank and Noordhinder Bank.  The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the North Sea as follows:[14]  On the Southwest. A line joining the Phare de Walde (Walde Lighthouse, in France, 50\u00b059'37\"N, 1\u00b054'53\"E) and Leathercoat Point (England, 51\u00b010'01.4\"N 1\u00b024'07.8\").[15] northeast of Dover.  On the Northwest. From Dunnet Head (58\u00b040'20\"N, 3\u00b022'30\"W) in Scotland to Tor Ness (58\u00b047'N) in the Island of Hoy, thence through this island to the Kame of Hoy (58\u00b055'N) on to Breck Ness on Mainland (58\u00b058'N) through this island to Costa Head (3\u00b014'W) and Inga Ness (59'17'N) in Westray through Westray, to Bow Head, across to Mull Head (North point of Papa Westray) and on to Seal Skerry (North point of North Ronaldsay) and thence to Horse Island (South point of the Shetland Islands).  On the North. From the North point (Fethaland Point) of the Mainland of the Shetland Islands, across to Graveland Ness (60\u00b039'N) in the Island of Yell, through Yell to Gloup Ness (1\u00b004'W) and across to Spoo Ness (60\u00b045'N) in Unst island, through Unst to Herma Ness (60\u00b051'N), on to the SW point of the Rumblings and to Muckle Flugga (60\u00b051\u2032N 0\u00b053\u2032W\ufeff \/ \ufeff60.850\u00b0N 0.883\u00b0W\ufeff \/ 60.850; -0.883) all these being included in the North Sea area; thence up the meridian of 0\u00b053' West to the parallel of 61\u00b000' North and eastward along this parallel to the coast of Norway, the whole of Viking Bank is thus included in the North Sea.  On the East. The Western limit of the Skagerrak [A line joining Hanstholm (57\u00b007\u2032N 8\u00b036\u2032E\ufeff \/ \ufeff57.117\u00b0N 8.600\u00b0E\ufeff \/ 57.117; 8.600) and the Naze (Lindesnes, 58\u00b0N 7\u00b0E\ufeff \/ \ufeff58\u00b0N 7\u00b0E\ufeff \/ 58; 7)]. The average temperature is 17\u00a0\u00b0C (63\u00a0\u00b0F) in the summer and 6\u00a0\u00b0C (43\u00a0\u00b0F) in the winter.[4] The average temperatures have been trending higher since 1988, which has been attributed to climate change.[16][17] Air temperatures in January range on average between 0 and 4\u00a0\u00b0C (32 and 39\u00a0\u00b0F) and in July between 13 and 18\u00a0\u00b0C (55 and 64\u00a0\u00b0F). The winter months see frequent gales and storms.[1]  The salinity averages between 34 and 35 grams per litre (129 and 132\u00a0g\/US\u00a0gal) of water.[4] The salinity has the highest variability where there is fresh water inflow, such as at the Rhine and Elbe estuaries, the Baltic Sea exit and along the coast of Norway.[18]  The main pattern to the flow of water in the North Sea is an anti-clockwise rotation along the edges.[19]  The North Sea is an arm of the Atlantic Ocean receiving the majority of ocean current from the northwest opening, and a lesser portion of warm current from the smaller opening at the English Channel. These tidal currents leave along the Norwegian coast.[20] Surface and deep water currents may move in different directions. Low salinity surface coastal waters move offshore, and deeper, denser high salinity waters move inshore.[21]  The North Sea located on the continental shelf has different waves from those in deep ocean water. The wave speeds are diminished and the wave amplitudes are increased. In the North Sea there are two amphidromic systems and a third incomplete amphidromic system.[22][23] In the North Sea the average tide difference in wave amplitude is between zero and eight metres (26\u00a0ft).[An average is a single figure, not a range.][4] The presence of fixed-foundation wind turbines in the North Sea was created by action of the tide large visible sea plumes, as photographed by NASA.[24]  The Kelvin tide of the Atlantic Ocean is a semidiurnal wave that travels northward. Some of the energy from this wave travels through the English Channel into the North Sea. The wave continues to travel northward in the Atlantic Ocean, and once past the northern tip of Great Britain, the Kelvin wave turns east and south and once again enters the North Sea.[25]  The eastern and western coasts of the North Sea are jagged, formed by glaciers during the ice ages. The coastlines along the southernmost part are covered with the remains of deposited glacial sediment.[1] The Norwegian mountains plunge into the sea creating deep fjords and archipelagos. South of Stavanger, the coast softens, the islands become fewer.[1] The eastern Scottish coast is similar, though less severe than Norway. From north east of England, the cliffs become lower and are composed of less resistant moraine, which erodes more easily, so that the coasts have more rounded contours.[60][61] In the Netherlands, Belgium and in East Anglia the littoral is low and marshy.[1] The east coast and south-east of the North Sea (Wadden Sea) have coastlines that are mainly sandy and straight owing to longshore drift, particularly along Belgium and Denmark.[62]  The southern coastal areas were originally flood plains and swampy land. In areas especially vulnerable to storm surges, people settled behind elevated levees and on natural areas of high ground such as spits and geestland.[63]:\u200a[302,\u200a303]\u200a As early as 500 BC, people were constructing artificial dwelling hills higher than the prevailing flood levels.[63]:\u200a[306,\u200a308]\u200a It was only around the beginning of the High Middle Ages, in 1200 AD, that inhabitants began to connect single ring dikes into a dike line along the entire coast, thereby turning amphibious regions between the land and the sea into permanent solid ground.[63]  The modern form of the dikes supplemented by overflow and lateral diversion channels, began to appear in the 17th and 18th centuries, built in the Netherlands.[64] The North Sea Floods of 1953 and 1962 were the impetus for further raising of the dikes as well as the shortening of the coast line so as to present as little surface area as possible to the punishment of the sea and the storms.[65] Currently, 27% of the Netherlands is below sea level protected by dikes, dunes, and beach flats.[66]  Coastal management today consists of several levels.[67] The dike slope reduces the energy of the incoming sea, so that the dike itself does not receive the full impact.[67] Dikes that lie directly on the sea are especially reinforced.[67] The dikes have, over the years, been repeatedly raised, sometimes up to 9 metres (30\u00a0ft) and have been made flatter to better reduce wave erosion.[68] Where the dunes are sufficient to protect the land behind them from the sea, these dunes are planted with beach grass (Ammophila arenaria) to protect them from erosion by wind, water, and foot traffic.[69]  Storm surges threaten, in particular, the coasts of the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and Denmark and low-lying areas of eastern England particularly around The Wash and Fens.[62] Storm surges are caused by changes in barometric pressure combined with strong wind created wave action.[70]  The first recorded storm tide flood was the Julianenflut, on 17 February 1164. In its wake, the Jadebusen, (a bay on the coast of Germany), began to form. A storm tide in 1228 is recorded to have killed more than 100,000 people.[71] In 1362, the Second Marcellus Flood, also known as the Grote Manndrenke, hit the entire southern coast of the North Sea. Chronicles of the time again record more than 100,000 deaths, large parts of the coast were lost permanently to the sea, including the now legendary lost city of Rungholt.[72] In the 20th century, the North Sea flood of 1953 flooded several nations' coasts and cost more than 2,000 lives.[73] 315 citizens of Hamburg died in the North Sea flood of 1962.[74]:\u200a[79,\u200a86]\u200a  Though rare, the North Sea has been the site of a number of historically documented tsunamis. The Storegga Slides were a series of underwater landslides, in which a piece of the Norwegian continental shelf slid into the Norwegian Sea. The immense landslips occurred between 8150 BCE and 6000 BCE, and caused a tsunami up to 20 metres (66\u00a0ft) high that swept through the North Sea, having the greatest effect on Scotland and the Faeroe Islands.[75][76] The Dover Straits earthquake of 1580 is among the first recorded earthquakes in the North Sea measuring between 5.6 and 5.9 on the Richter scale. This event caused extensive damage in Calais both through its tremors and possibly triggered a tsunami, though this has never been confirmed. The theory is a vast underwater landslide in the English Channel was triggered by the earthquake, which in turn caused a tsunami.[77] The tsunami triggered by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake reached Holland, although the waves had lost their destructive power. The largest earthquake ever recorded in the United Kingdom was the 1931 Dogger Bank earthquake, which measured 6.1 on the Richter magnitude scale and caused a small tsunami that flooded parts of the British coast.[77]  Shallow epicontinental seas like the current North Sea have since long existed on the European continental shelf. The rifting that formed the northern part of the Atlantic Ocean during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, from about 150\u00a0million years ago, caused tectonic uplift in the British Isles.[78] Since then, a shallow sea has almost continuously existed between the uplands of the Fennoscandian Shield and the British Isles.[79] This precursor of the current North Sea has grown and shrunk with the rise and fall of the eustatic sea level during geologic time. Sometimes it was connected with other shallow seas, such as the sea above the Paris Basin to the south-west, the Paratethys Sea to the south-east, or the Tethys Ocean to the south.[80]  During the Late Cretaceous, about 85\u00a0million years ago, all of modern mainland Europe except for Scandinavia was a scattering of islands.[81] By the Early Oligocene, 34\u00a0to\u00a028 million years ago, the emergence of Western and Central Europe had almost completely separated the North Sea from the Tethys Ocean, which gradually shrank to become the Mediterranean as Southern Europe and South West Asia became dry land.[82] The North Sea was cut off from the English Channel by a narrow land bridge until that was breached by at least two catastrophic floods between 450,000 and 180,000 years ago.[83][84] Since the start of the Quaternary period about 2.6\u00a0million years ago, the eustatic sea level has fallen during each glacial period and then risen again. Every time the ice sheet reached its greatest extent, the North Sea became almost completely dry, the dry landmass being known as Doggerland, whose northern regions were themselves known to have been glaciated.[85] The present-day coastline formed after the Last Glacial Maximum when the sea began to flood the European continental shelf.[86]  In 2006 a bone fragment was found while drilling for oil in the North Sea. Analysis indicated that it was a Plateosaurus from 199 to 216\u00a0million years ago. This was the deepest dinosaur fossil ever found and the first find for Norway.[87]  Copepods and other zooplankton are plentiful in the North Sea. These tiny organisms are crucial elements of the food chain supporting many species of fish.[88] Over 230 species of fish live in the North Sea. Cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, plaice, sole, mackerel, herring, pouting, sprat, and sandeel are all very common and are fished commercially.[88][89] Due to the various depths of the North Sea trenches and differences in salinity, temperature, and water movement, some fish such as blue-mouth redfish and rabbitfish reside only in small areas of the North Sea.[90]  Crustaceans are also commonly found throughout the sea. Norway lobster, deep-water prawns, and brown shrimp are all commercially fished, but other species of lobster, shrimp, oyster, mussels and clams all live in the North Sea.[88] Recently non-indigenous species have become established including the Pacific oyster and Atlantic jackknife clam.[89]  The coasts of the North Sea are home to nature reserves including the Ythan Estuary, Fowlsheugh Nature Preserve, and Farne Islands in the UK and the Wadden Sea National Parks in Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands.[88] These locations provide breeding habitat for dozens of bird species. Tens of millions of birds make use of the North Sea for breeding, feeding, or migratory stopovers every year. Populations of black-legged kittiwakes, Atlantic puffins, northern gannets, northern fulmars, and species of petrels, seaducks, loons (divers), cormorants, gulls, auks, and terns, and many other seabirds make these coasts popular for birdwatching.[88][89]  The North Sea is also home to marine mammals. Common seals, grey seals, and harbour porpoises can be found along the coasts, at marine installations, and on islands. The very northern North Sea islands such as the Shetland Islands are occasionally home to a larger variety of pinnipeds including bearded, harp, hooded and ringed seals, and even walrus.[91] North Sea cetaceans include various porpoise, dolphin and whale species.[89][92]  Plant species in the North Sea include species of wrack, among them bladder wrack, knotted wrack, and serrated wrack. Algae, macroalgal, and kelp, such as oarweed and laminaria hyperboria, and species of maerl are found as well.[89] Eelgrass, formerly common in the entirety of the Wadden Sea, was nearly wiped out in the 20th century by a disease.[93] Similarly, sea grass used to coat huge tracts of ocean floor, but have been damaged by trawling and dredging have diminished its habitat and prevented its return.[94] Invasive Japanese seaweed has spread along the shores of the sea clogging harbours and inlets and has become a nuisance.[95]  Due to the heavy human populations and high level of industrialization along its shores, the wildlife of the North Sea has suffered from pollution, overhunting, and overfishing. Flamingos and pelicans were once found along the southern shores of the North Sea, but became extinct over the second millennium.[96] Walruses frequented the Orkney Islands through the mid-16th\u00a0century, as both Sable Island and Orkney Islands lay within their normal range.[97] Grey whales also resided in the North Sea but were driven to extinction in the Atlantic in the 17th\u00a0century[98] Other species have dramatically declined in population, though they are still found. North Atlantic right whales, sturgeon, shad, rays, skates, salmon, and other species were common in the North Sea until the 20th\u00a0century, when numbers declined due to overfishing.[99][100]  Other factors like the introduction of non-indigenous species, industrial and agricultural pollution, trawling and dredging, human-induced eutrophication, construction on coastal breeding and feeding grounds, sand and gravel extraction, offshore construction, and heavy shipping traffic have also contributed to the decline.[89] For example, a resident orca pod was lost in the 1960s, presumably due to the peak in PCB pollution in this time period.[101]  The OSPAR commission manages the OSPAR convention to counteract the harmful effects of human activity on wildlife in the North Sea, preserve endangered species, and provide environmental protection.[102] All North Sea border states are signatories of the MARPOL 73\/78 Accords, which preserve the marine environment by preventing pollution from ships.[103] Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands also have a trilateral agreement for the protection of the Wadden Sea, or mudflats, which run along the coasts of the three countries on the southern edge of the North Sea.[104]  The North Sea has had various names throughout history. One of the earliest recorded names was Septentrionalis Oceanus, or \"Northern Ocean\", which was cited by Pliny.[105] He also noted that the Cimbri called it Morimarusa - \"Dead Sea\".[106] The name \"North Sea\" probably came into English, however, via the Dutch \"Noordzee\", who named it thus either in contrast with the Zuiderzee (\"South Sea\"), located south of Frisia, or because the sea is generally to the north of the Netherlands. Before the adoption of \"North Sea\", the names used in English were \"German Sea\" or \"German Ocean\", referred to as the Latin names \"Mare Germanicum\" and \"Oceanus Germanicus\",[107] and these persisted in use until the First World War.[108] Other common names in use for long periods were the Latin terms \"Mare Frisicum\", as well as the English equivalent, \"Frisian Sea\".[109][110] The modern names of the sea in the other local languages are: Danish: Vesterhavet [\u02c8vest\u0250\u02cch\u025b\u02c0v\u00f0\u0329] (\"West Sea\") or Nords\u00f8en [\u02c8no\u0250\u032f\u02ccs\u00f8\u02c0n\u0329], Dutch: Noordzee, Dutch Low Saxon: Noordzee, French: Mer du Nord, West Frisian: Noardsee, German: Nordsee, Low German: Noordsee, Northern Frisian: Weestsiie (\"West Sea\"), Swedish: Nordsj\u00f6n, Bokm\u00e5l: Nordsj\u00f8en [\u02c8n\u00fb\u02d0r\u02cc\u0282\u00f8\u02d0n], Nynorsk: Nordsj\u00f8en, Scots: North Sea and Scottish Gaelic: An Cuan a Tuath.  The North Sea has provided waterway access for commerce and conquest. Many areas have access to the North Sea because of its long coastline and the European rivers that empty it.[1] There is little documentary evidence concerning the North Sea before the Roman conquest of Britain in 43 CE, however, archaeological evidence reveals the diffusion of cultures and technologies from across or along the North Sea to Great Britain and Scandinavia and reliance by some prehistoric cultures on fishing, whaling, and seaborne trade on the North Sea. The Romans established organised ports in Britain, which increased shipping and began sustained trade[111] the diffusion of cultures and technologies from across or along the North Sea to Great Britain and Scandinavia and reliance by some prehistoric cultures on fishing, whaling, and seaborne trade on the North Sea. The Romans established organised ports in Britain, which increased shipping and began sustained trade[111] and many Scandinavian tribes participated in raids and wars against the Romans and Roman coinage and manufacturing were important trade goods. When the Romans abandoned Britain in 410, the Germanic Angles, Frisians, Saxons, and Jutes began the next great migration across the North Sea during the Migration Period. They made successive invasions of the island from what is now the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany.[112]  The Viking Age began in 793 with the attack on Lindisfarne; for the next quarter-millennium, the Vikings ruled the North Sea. In their superior longships, they raided, traded, and established colonies and outposts along the coasts of the sea. From the Middle Ages through the 15th century, the northern European coastal ports exported domestic goods, dyes, linen, salt, metal goods and wine. The Scandinavian and Baltic areas shipped grain, fish, naval necessities, and timber. In turn, the North Sea countries imported high-grade cloths, spices, and fruits from the Mediterranean region.[113] Commerce during this era was mainly conducted by maritime trade due to underdeveloped roadways.[113]  In the 13th century the Hanseatic League, though centred on the Baltic Sea, started to control most of the trade through important members and outposts on the North Sea.[114] The League lost its dominance in the 16th century, as neighbouring states took control of former Hanseatic cities and outposts. Their internal conflict prevented effective cooperation and defence.[115] As the League lost control of its maritime cities, new trade routes emerged that provided Europe with Asian, American, and African goods.[116][117]  The 17th century Dutch Golden Age saw Dutch maritime power at its zenith.[118][119] Important overseas colonies, a vast merchant marine, a large fishing fleet,[113] powerful navy, and sophisticated financial markets made the Dutch the ascendant power in the North Sea, to be challenged by an ambitious England. This rivalry led to the first three Anglo-Dutch Wars between 1652 and 1673, which ended with Dutch victories.[119] After the Glorious Revolution in 1688, the Dutch prince William ascended to the English throne. With unified leadership, commercial, military, and political power began to shift from Amsterdam to London.[120] The British did not face a challenge to their dominance of the North Sea until the 20th century.[121]  Tensions in the North Sea were again heightened in 1904 by the Dogger Bank incident. During the Russo-Japanese War, several ships of the Russian Baltic Fleet, which was on its way to the Far East, mistook British fishing boats for Japanese ships and fired on them, and then upon each other, near the Dogger Bank, nearly causing Britain to enter the war on the side of Japan.  During the First World War, Great Britain's Grand Fleet and Germany's Kaiserliche Marine faced each other in the North Sea,[122] which became the main theatre of the war for surface action.[122] Britain's larger fleet and North Sea Mine Barrage were able to establish an effective blockade for most of the war, which restricted the Central Powers' access to many crucial resources.[123] Major battles included the Battle of Heligoland Bight,[124] the Battle of the Dogger Bank,[125] and the Battle of Jutland.[125] World War I also brought the first extensive use of submarine warfare, and a number of submarine actions occurred in the North Sea.[126]  The Second World War also saw action in the North Sea, though it was restricted more to aircraft reconnaissance and action by fighter\/bomber aircraft, submarines and smaller vessels such as minesweepers and torpedo boats.[127][128]  After the war, hundreds of thousands of tons of chemical weapons were disposed of by being dumped in the North Sea.[129]  After the war, the North Sea lost much of its military significance because it is bordered only by NATO member-states. However, it gained significant economic importance in the 1960s as the states around the North Sea began full-scale exploitation of its oil and gas resources.[130] The North Sea continues to be an active trade route.[131]  Countries that border the North Sea all claim the 12 nautical miles (22\u00a0km; 14\u00a0mi) of territorial waters, within which they have exclusive fishing rights.[132] The Common Fisheries Policy of the European Union (EU) exists to coordinate fishing rights and assist with disputes between EU states and the EU border state of Norway.[133]  After the discovery of mineral resources in the North Sea during the early 1960s, the Convention on the Continental Shelf established country rights largely divided along the median line. The median line is defined as the line \"every point of which is equidistant from the nearest points of the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea of each State is measured\".[134] The ocean floor border between Germany, the Netherlands, and Denmark was only reapportioned in 1969 after protracted negotiations and a judgment of the International Court of Justice.[132][135]  As early as 1859, oil was discovered in onshore areas around the North Sea and natural gas as early as 1910.[81] Onshore resources, for example the K12-B field in the Netherlands continue to be exploited today.  Offshore test drilling began in 1966 and then, in 1969, Phillips Petroleum Company discovered the Ekofisk oil field[136] distinguished by valuable, low-sulphur oil.[137] Commercial exploitation began in 1971 with tankers and, after 1975, by a pipeline, first to Teesside, England and then, after 1977, also to Emden, Germany.[138]  The exploitation of the North Sea oil reserves began just before the 1973 oil crisis, and the climb of international oil prices made the large investments needed for extraction much more attractive.[139] The start in 1973 of the oil reserves by the UK allowed them to stop the declining position in international trade in 1974, and a huge increase after the discovery and exploitation of the huge oil field by Phillips group in 1977 as the Brae field.  Although the production costs are relatively high, the quality of the oil, the political stability of the region, and the proximity of important markets in western Europe have made the North Sea an important oil-producing region.[137] The largest single humanitarian catastrophe in the North Sea oil industry was the destruction of the offshore oil platform Piper Alpha in 1988 in which 167 people lost their lives.[140]  Besides the Ekofisk oil field, the Statfjord oil field is also notable as it was the cause of the first pipeline to span the Norwegian trench.[141] The largest natural gas field in the North Sea, Troll gas field, lies in the Norwegian trench, dropping over 300 metres (980\u00a0ft), requiring the construction of the enormous Troll A platform to access it.  The price of Brent Crude, one of the first types of oil extracted from the North Sea is used today as a standard price for comparison for crude oil from the rest of the world.[142] The North Sea contains western Europe's largest oil and natural gas reserves and is one of the world's key non-OPEC producing regions.[143]  In the UK sector of the North Sea, the oil industry invested \u00a314.4\u00a0billion in 2013 and was on track to spend \u00a313\u00a0billion in 2014. Industry body Oil & Gas UK put the decline down to rising costs, lower production, high tax rates, and less exploration.[144]  In January 2018, The North Sea region contained 184 offshore rigs, which made it the region with the highest number of offshore rigs in the world at the time.[145]  The North Sea is Europe's main fishery accounting for over 5% of international commercial fish caught.[1] Fishing in the North Sea is concentrated in the southern part of the coastal waters. The main method of fishing is trawling.[146] In 1995, the total volume of fish and shellfish caught in the North Sea was approximately 3.5\u00a0million tonnes.[147] Besides saleable fish, it is estimated that one million tonnes of unmarketable by-catch is caught and discarded to die each year.[148]  In recent decades, overfishing has left many fisheries unproductive, disturbing marine food chain dynamics and costing jobs in the fishing industry.[149] Herring, cod and plaice fisheries may soon face the same plight as mackerel fishing, which ceased in the 1970s due to overfishing.[150] The objective of the European Union Common Fisheries Policy is to minimize the environmental impact associated with resource use by reducing fish discards, increasing the productivity of fisheries, stabilising markets of fisheries and fish processing, and supplying fish at reasonable prices for the consumer.[151]  Whaling was an important economic activity from the 9th until the 13th century for Flemish whalers.[152] The medieval Flemish, Basque and Norwegian whalers who were replaced in the 16th century by Dutch, English, Danes, and Germans, took massive numbers of whales and dolphins and nearly depleted the right whales. This activity likely led to the extinction of the Atlantic population of the once common grey whale.[153] By 1902 the whaling had ended.[152] After being absent for 300 years a single grey whale returned in 2010,[154] it probably was the first of many more to find its way through the now ice-free Northwest Passage.  In addition to oil, gas, and fish, the states along the North Sea also take millions of cubic metres per year of sand and gravel from the ocean floor. These are used for beach nourishment, land reclamation and construction.[155] Rolled pieces of amber may be picked up on the east coast of England.[156]  Due to the strong prevailing winds, and shallow water, countries on the North Sea, particularly Germany and Denmark, have used the shore for wind power since the 1990s.[157] The North Sea is the home of one of the first large-scale offshore wind farms in the world, Horns Rev 1, completed in 2002. Since then many other wind farms have been commissioned in the North Sea (and elsewhere). As of 2013, the 630\u00a0megawatt (MW) London Array is the largest offshore wind farm in the world, with the 504 (MW) Greater Gabbard wind farm the second largest, followed by the 367\u00a0MW Walney Wind Farm. All are off the coast of the UK. These projects will be dwarfed by subsequent wind farms that are in the pipeline, including Dogger Bank at 4,800\u00a0MW, Norfolk Bank (7,200\u00a0MW), and Irish Sea (4,200\u00a0MW). At the end of June 2013 total European combined offshore wind energy capacity was 6,040\u00a0MW. The UK installed 513.5\u00a0MW of offshore wind power in the first half-year of 2013.[158] The development of the offshore wind industry in UK-controlled areas of the North Sea is traced to three phases: coastal, off-coastal and deep offshore in the period 2004 - 2021.[159]  The expansion of offshore wind farms has met with some resistance. Concerns have included shipping collisions[160] and environmental effects on ocean ecology and wildlife such as fish and migratory birds,[161] however, these concerns were found to be negligible in a long-term study in Denmark released in 2006 and again in a UK government study in 2009.[162][163] There are also concerns about reliability,[164] and the rising costs of constructing and maintaining offshore wind farms.[165] Despite these, development of North Sea wind power is continuing, with plans for additional wind farms off the coasts of Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK.[166] There have also been proposals for a transnational power grid in the North Sea[167][168] to connect new offshore wind farms.[169]  Energy production from tidal power is still in a pre-commercial stage. The European Marine Energy Centre has installed a wave testing system at Billia Croo on the Orkney mainland[170] and a tidal power testing station on the nearby island of Eday.[171] Since 2003, a prototype Wave Dragon energy converter has been in operation at Nissum Bredning fjord of northern Denmark.[172]  The beaches and coastal waters of the North Sea are destinations for tourists. The English, Belgian, Dutch, German and Danish coasts[173][174] are developed for tourism. The North Sea coast of the United Kingdom has tourist destinations with beach resorts and links golf courses; the coastal town of St. Andrews in Scotland is renowned as the \"Home of Golf\".[citation needed]  The North Sea Trail is a long-distance trail linking seven countries around the North Sea.[175] Windsurfing and sailing[176] are popular sports because of the strong winds. Mudflat hiking,[177] recreational fishing and birdwatching[174] are among other activities.  The climatic conditions on the North Sea coast have been claimed to be healthy. As early as the 19th century, travellers visited the North Sea coast for curative and restorative vacations. The sea air, temperature, wind, water, and sunshine are counted among the beneficial conditions that are said to activate the body's defences, improve circulation, strengthen the immune system, and have healing effects on the skin and the respiratory system.[178]  The Wadden Sea in Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands is an UNESCO World Heritage Site.  The North Sea is important for marine transport and its shipping lanes are among the busiest in the world.[132] Major ports are located along its coasts: Rotterdam, the busiest port in Europe and the fourth busiest port in the world by tonnage as of 2013[update], Antwerp (was 16th) and Hamburg (was 27th), Bremen\/Bremerhaven and Felixstowe, both in the top 30 busiest container seaports,[179] as well as the Port of Bruges-Zeebrugge, Europe's leading ro-ro port.[180]  Fishing boats, service boats for offshore industries, sport and pleasure craft, and merchant ships to and from North Sea ports and Baltic ports must share routes on the North Sea. The Dover Strait alone sees more than 400 commercial vessels a day.[181] Because of this volume, navigation in the North Sea can be difficult in high traffic zones, so ports have established elaborate vessel traffic services to monitor and direct ships into and out of port.[182]  The North Sea coasts are home to numerous canals and canal systems to facilitate traffic between and among rivers, artificial harbours, and the sea. The Kiel Canal, connecting the North Sea with the Baltic Sea, is the most heavily used artificial seaway in the world reporting an average of 89 ships per day not including sporting boats and other small watercraft in 2009.[183] It saves an average of 250 nautical miles (460\u00a0km; 290\u00a0mi), instead of the voyage around the Jutland peninsula.[184] The North Sea Canal connects Amsterdam with the North Sea. "},{"title":"Physical strength","content":"Physical strength is the measure of an individual's exertion of force on physical objects. Increasing physical strength is the goal of strength training.  An individual's physical strength is determined by two factors: the cross-sectional area of muscle fibers recruited to generate force and the intensity of the recruitment. Individuals with a high proportion of type I slow twitch muscle fibers will be relatively weaker than a similar individual with a high proportion of type II fast twitch fibers, but would have greater endurance. The genetic inheritance of muscle fiber type sets the outermost boundaries of physical strength possible (barring the use of enhancing agents such as testosterone), although the unique position within this envelope is determined by training.   Individual muscle fiber ratios can be determined through a muscle biopsy. Other considerations are the ability to recruit muscle fibers for a particular activity, joint angles, and the length of each limb. For a given cross-section, shorter limbs are able to lift more weight. The ability to gain muscle also varies person to person, based mainly upon genes dictating the amounts of hormones secreted, but also on sex, age, health of the person, and adequate nutrients in the diet. A one-repetition maximum test is the most accurate way to determine maximum muscular strength.[1][2]  There are various ways to measure physical strength of a person or population. Strength capability analysis is usually done in the field of ergonomics where a particular task (e.g., lifting a load, pushing a cart, etc.) and\/or a posture is evaluated and compared to the capabilities of the section of the population that the task is intended towards. The external reactive moments and forces on the joints are usually used in such cases. The strength capability of the joint is denoted by the amount of moment that the muscle force can create at the joint to counter the external moment.  Skeletal muscles produce reactive forces and moments at the joints. To avoid injury or fatigue, when person is performing a task, such as pushing or lifting a load, the external moments created at the joints due to the load at the hand and the weight of the body segments must be ideally less than the muscular moment strengths at the joint.  One of the first sagittal-plane models to predict strength was developed by Chaffin in 1969.[3]  Based on this model, the external moments at each joint must not exceed the muscle strength moments at that joint.  Where, Sj is the muscle strength moment at joint, j, and Mj\/L is the external moment at the joint, j, due to load, L and the body segments preceding the joint in the top-down analysis.  Top-down analysis is the method of calculating the reactive moments and forces at each joint starting at the hand, all the way till the ankle and foot. In a 6-segment model, the joints considered are elbow, shoulder, L5\/S1 disc of the spine, hip, knee and ankle. It is common to ignore the wrist joint in manual calculations. Software intended for such calculation use the wrist joint also, dividing the lower arm into hand and forearm segments.  Static strength prediction is the method of predicting the strength capabilities of a person or a population (based on anthropometry) for a particular task and\/or posture (an isometric contraction). To predict capability, manual calculations are usually performed using the top-down analysis on a six or seven-link model, based on available information about the case and then compared to standard guidelines, such as the one provided by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.

It contains nearly one-third of the United Kingdom's land area, consisting of the northern part of the island of Great Britain and more than 790 adjacent islands, principally in the archipelagos of the Hebrides and the Northern Isles. To the south-east, Scotland has its only land border, which is 96 miles (154\u00a0km) long and shared with England; the country is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west, the North Sea to the north-east and east, and the Irish Sea to the south. The population in 2022 was 5,436,600 and accounts for 8% of the population of the UK.[10] Edinburgh is the capital and Glasgow is the largest of the cities of Scotland.  The Kingdom of Scotland emerged in the 9th century. In 1603, James VI inherited England and Ireland, forming a personal union of the three kingdoms. On 1 May 1707 Scotland and England combined to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain,[11][12] with the Parliament of Scotland subsumed into the Parliament of Great Britain. In 1999 a Scottish Parliament was re-established, and has devolved authority over many areas of domestic policy.[13] The country has a distinct legal system, educational system, and religious history from the rest of the UK, which have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity.[14] Scottish English and Scots are the most widely spoken languages in the country, existing on a dialect continuum with each other.[15] Scottish Gaelic speakers can be found all over Scotland, however the language is largely spoken natively by communities within the Hebrides.[16] The number of Gaelic speakers numbers less than 2% of the total population, though state-sponsored revitalisation attempts have led to a growing community of second language speakers.[17]   The mainland of Scotland is broadly divided into three regions: the Highlands, a mountainous region in the north and north-west; the Lowlands, a flatter plain across the centre of the country; and the Southern Uplands, a hilly region along the southern border. The Highlands are the most mountainous region of the British Isles and contain its highest peak, Ben Nevis, at 4,413 feet (1,345\u00a0m).[10] The region also contains many lakes, called lochs; the term is also applied to the many saltwater inlets along the country's deeply indented western coastline. The geography of the many islands is varied. Some, such as Mull and Skye, are noted for their mountainous terrain, while the likes of Tiree and Coll are much flatter. Scotland comes from Scoti, the Latin name for the Gaels.[18] Philip Freeman has speculated on the likelihood of a group of raiders adopting a name from an Indo-European root, *skot, citing the parallel in Greek skotos (\u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"darkness, gloom\".[19] The Late Latin word Scotia (\"land of the Gaels\") was initially used to refer to Ireland,[20] and likewise in early Old English Scotland was used for Ireland.[21] By the 11th century at the latest, Scotia was being used to refer to (Gaelic-speaking) Scotland north of the River Forth, alongside Albania or Albany, both derived from the Gaelic Alba.[22] The use of the words Scots and Scotland to encompass all of what is now Scotland became common in the Late Middle Ages.[11]  Prehistoric Scotland, before the arrival of the Roman Empire, was culturally divergent.[23]  Repeated glaciations, which covered the entire land mass of modern Scotland, destroyed any traces of human habitation that may have existed before the Mesolithic period. It is believed the first post-glacial groups of hunter-gatherers arrived in Scotland around 12,800 years ago, as the ice sheet retreated after the last glaciation.[24] At the time, Scotland was covered in forests, had more bog-land, and the main form of transport was by water.[25]:\u200a9\u200a These settlers began building the first known permanent houses on Scottish soil around 9,500 years ago, and the first villages around 6,000 years ago. The well-preserved village of Skara Brae on the mainland of Orkney dates from this period. Neolithic habitation, burial, and ritual sites are particularly common and well preserved in the Northern Isles and Western Isles, where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone.[26] Evidence of sophisticated pre-Christian belief systems is demonstrated by sites such as the Callanish Stones on Lewis and the Maes Howe on Orkney, which were built in the third millennium BC.[27]:\u200a38\u200a  The first written reference to Scotland was in 320 BC by Greek sailor Pytheas, who called the northern tip of Britain \"Orcas\", the source of the name of the Orkney islands.[25]:\u200a10\u200a  Most of modern Scotland was not incorporated into the Roman Empire, and Roman control over parts of the area fluctuated over a rather short period. The first Roman incursion into Scotland was in 79 AD, when Agricola invaded Scotland; he defeated a Caledonian army at the Battle of Mons Graupius in 83 AD.[25]:\u200a12\u200a After the Roman victory, Roman forts were briefly set along the Gask Ridge close to the Highland line, but by three years after the battle, the Roman armies had withdrawn to the Southern Uplands.[28] Remains of Roman forts established in the 1st century have been found as far north as the Moray Firth.[29] By the reign of the Roman emperor Trajan (r.\u200998\u2013117), Roman control had lapsed to Britain south of a line between the River Tyne and the Solway Firth.[30] Along this line, Trajan's successor Hadrian (r.\u2009117\u2013138) erected Hadrian's Wall in northern England[25]:\u200a12\u200a and the Limes Britannicus became the northern border of the Roman Empire.[31][32] The Roman influence on the southern part of the country was considerable, and they introduced Christianity to Scotland.[25]:\u200a13\u201314\u200a[27]:\u200a38\u200a  The Antonine Wall was built from 142 at the order of Hadrian's successor Antoninus Pius (r.\u2009138\u2013161), defending the Roman part of Scotland from the unadministered part of the island, north of a line between the Firth of Clyde and the Firth of Forth.[33] The Roman invasion of Caledonia 208\u2013210 was undertaken by emperors of the imperial Severan dynasty in response to the breaking of a treaty by the Caledonians in 197,[29] but permanent conquest of the whole of Great Britain was forestalled by Roman forces becoming bogged down in punishing guerrilla warfare and the death of the senior emperor Septimius Severus (r.\u2009193\u2013211) at Eboracum (York) after he was taken ill while on campaign. Although forts erected by the Roman army in the Severan campaign were placed near those established by Agricola and were clustered at the mouths of the glens in the Highlands, the Caledonians were again in revolt in 210\u2013211 and these were overrun.[29]  To the Roman historians Tacitus and Cassius Dio, the Scottish Highlands and the area north of the River Forth was called Caledonia.[29] According to Cassius Dio, the inhabitants of Caledonia were the Caledonians and the Maeatae.[29] Other ancient authors used the adjective \"Caledonian\" to mean anywhere in northern or inland Britain, often mentioning the region's people and animals, its cold climate, its pearls, and a noteworthy region of wooded hills (Latin: saltus) which the 2nd century AD Roman philosopher Ptolemy, in his Geography, described as being south-west of the Beauly Firth.[29] The name Caledonia is echoed in the place names of Dunkeld, Rohallion, and Schiehallion.[29]  The Great Conspiracy constituted a seemingly coordinated invasion against Roman rule in Britain in the later 4th century, which included the participation of the Gaelic Scoti and the Caledonians, who were then known as Picts by the Romans. This was defeated by the comes Theodosius; but Roman military government was withdrawn from the island altogether by the early 5th century, resulting in the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain and the immigration of the Saxons to southeastern Scotland and the rest of eastern Great Britain.[30]  Beginning in the sixth century, the area that is now Scotland was divided into three areas: Pictland, a patchwork of small lordships in central Scotland;[25]:\u200a25\u201326\u200a the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Northumbria, which had conquered southeastern Scotland;[25]:\u200a18\u201320\u200a and D\u00e1l Riata, which included territory in western Scotland and northern Ireland, and spread Gaelic language and culture into Scotland.[34] These societies were based on the family unit and had sharp divisions in wealth, although the vast majority were poor and worked full-time in subsistence agriculture. The Picts kept slaves (mostly captured in war) through the ninth century.[25]:\u200a26\u201327\u200a  Gaelic influence over Pictland and Northumbria was facilitated by the large number of Gaelic-speaking clerics working as missionaries.[25]:\u200a23\u201324\u200a Operating in the sixth century on the island of Iona, Saint Columba was one of the earliest and best-known missionaries.[27]:\u200a39\u200a The Vikings began to raid Scotland in the eighth century. Although the raiders sought slaves and luxury items, their main motivation was to acquire land. The oldest Norse settlements were in northwest Scotland, but they eventually conquered many areas along the coast. Old Norse entirely displaced Pictish in the Northern Isles.[35]  In the ninth century, the Norse threat allowed a Gael named Kenneth I (Cin\u00e1ed mac Ailp\u00edn) to seize power over Pictland, establishing a royal dynasty to which the modern monarchs trace their lineage, and marking the beginning of the end of Pictish culture.[25]:\u200a31\u201332\u200a[36] The kingdom of Cin\u00e1ed and his descendants, called Alba, was Gaelic in character but existed on the same area as Pictland. By the end of the tenth century, the Pictish language went extinct as its speakers shifted to Gaelic.[25]:\u200a32\u201333\u200a From a base in eastern Scotland north of the River Forth and south of the River Spey, the kingdom expanded first southwards, into the former Northumbrian lands, and northwards into Moray.[25]:\u200a34\u201335\u200a Around the turn of the millennium, there was a centralization in agricultural lands and the first towns began to be established.[25]:\u200a36\u201337\u200a  In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, much of Scotland was under the control of a single ruler. Initially, Gaelic culture predominated, but immigrants from France, England and Flanders steadily created a more diverse society, with the Gaelic language starting to be replaced by Scots; and a modern nation-state emerged from this. At the end of this period, war against England started the growth of a Scottish national consciousness.[37]:\u200a37-39\u200a[38]:\u200ach 1\u200a David I (1124\u20131153) and his successors centralised royal power[37]:\u200a41\u201342\u200a and united mainland Scotland, capturing regions such as Moray, Galloway, and Caithness, although he could not extend his power over the Hebrides, which had been ruled by various Scottish clans following the death of Somerled in 1164.[37]:\u200a48\u201349\u200a In 1266, Scotland fought the short but consequential Scottish-Norwegian War which saw the reclamation of the Hebrides after the strong defeat of King Haakon IV and his forces at the Battle of Largs.[39] Up until that point, the Hebrides had been under Norwegian Viking control for roughly 400 years and had developed a distinctive Norse\u2013Gaelic culture that saw many Old Norse loanwords enter the Scottish Gaelic spoken by islanders, and through successive generations the Norse would become almost completely assimilated into Gaelic culture and the Scottish clan system. After the conflict, Scotland had to affirm Norwegian sovereignty of the Northern Isles, but they were later integrated into Scotland in the 15th century. Scandinavian culture in the form of the Norn language survived for a lot longer than in the Hebrides, and would strongly influence the local Scots dialect on Shetland and Orkney.[40] Later, a system of feudalism was consolidated, with both Anglo-Norman incomers and native Gaelic chieftains being granted land in exchange for serving the king.[37]:\u200a53\u201354\u200a The relationship with England was complex during this period: Scottish kings tried several times, sometimes with success, to exploit English political turmoil, followed by the longest period of peace between Scotland and England in the mediaeval period: from 1217\u20131296.[37]:\u200a45-46\u200a  The death of Alexander III in March 1286 broke the succession line of Scotland's kings. Edward I of England arbitrated between various claimants for the Scottish crown. In return for surrendering Scotland's nominal independence, John Balliol was pronounced king in 1292.[37]:\u200a47\u200a[41] In 1294, Balliol and other Scottish lords refused Edward's demands to serve in his army against the French. Scotland and France sealed a treaty on 23 October 1295, known as the Auld Alliance. War ensued, and John was deposed by Edward who took personal control of Scotland. Andrew Moray and William Wallace initially emerged as the principal leaders of the resistance to English rule in the Wars of Scottish Independence,[42] until Robert the Bruce was crowned king of Scotland in 1306.[43] Victory at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 proved the Scots had regained control of their kingdom. In 1320 the world's first documented declaration of independence, the Declaration of Arbroath, won the support of Pope John XXII, leading to the legal recognition of Scottish sovereignty by the English Crown. [44]:\u200a70,\u200a72\u200a  A civil war between the Bruce dynasty and their long-term rivals of the House of Comyn and House of Balliol lasted until the middle of the 14th century. Although the Bruce faction was successful, David II's lack of an heir allowed his half-nephew Robert II, the Lord High Steward of Scotland, to come to the throne and establish the House of Stewart.[44]:\u200a77\u200a The Stewarts ruled Scotland for the remainder of the Middle Ages. The country they ruled experienced greater prosperity from the end of the 14th century through the Scottish Renaissance to the Reformation,[45]:\u200a93\u200a despite the effects of the Black Death in 1349[44]:\u200a76\u200a and increasing division between Highlands and Lowlands.[44]:\u200a78\u200a Multiple truces reduced warfare on the southern border.[44]:\u200a76,\u200a83\u200a  The Treaty of Perpetual Peace was signed in 1502 by James IV of Scotland and Henry VII of England. James married Henry's daughter, Margaret Tudor.[46] James invaded England in support of France under the terms of the Auld Alliance and became the last monarch in Great Britain to die in battle, at Flodden in 1513.[47] The war with England during the minority years of Mary, Queen of Scots between 1543 and 1551 is known as the Rough Wooing.[48] In 1560, the Treaty of Edinburgh brought an end to the Siege of Leith and recognized the Protestant Elizabeth I as Queen of England.[45]:\u200a112\u200a The Parliament of Scotland met and immediately adopted the Scots Confession, which signalled the Scottish Reformation's sharp break from papal authority and Roman Catholic teaching.[27]:\u200a44\u200a The Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, was forced to abdicate in 1567.[49]  In 1603, James VI, King of Scots inherited the thrones of the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Ireland in the Union of the Crowns, and moved to London.[50] This was a personal union as despite having the same monarch the kingdoms retained their separate parliaments, laws and other institutions. The first Union Jack was designed at James's behest, to be flown in addition to the St Andrew's Cross on Scots vessels at sea. James VI and I intended to create a single kingdom of Great Britain, but was thwarted in his attempt to do so by the Parliament of England, which supported the wrecking proposal that a full legal union be sought instead, a proposal to which the Scots Parliament would not assent, causing the king to withdraw the plan.[51]  Except for a short period under the Protectorate, Scotland remained a separate state in the 17th century, but there was considerable conflict between the crown and the Covenanters over the form of church government.[52]:\u200a124\u200a The military was strengthened, allowing the imposition of royal authority on the western Highland clans. The 1609 Statutes of Iona compelled the cultural integration of Hebridean clan leaders.[53]:\u200a37\u201340\u200a In 1641 and again in 1643, the Parliament of Scotland unsuccessfully sought a union with England which was \"federative\" and not \"incorporating\", in which Scotland would retain a separate parliament.[54] The issue of union split the parliament in 1648.[54]  After the execution of the Scottish king at Whitehall in 1649, amid the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and its events in Scotland, Oliver Cromwell, the victorious Lord Protector, imposed the British Isles' first written constitution \u2013 the Instrument of Government \u2013 on Scotland in 1652 as part of the republican Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland.[54] The Protectorate Parliament was the first Westminster parliament to include representatives nominally from Scotland. The monarchy of the House of Stuart was resumed with the Restoration in Scotland in 1660. The Parliament of Scotland sought a commercial union with England in 1664; the proposal was rejected in 1668.[54] In 1670 the Parliament of England rejected a proposed political union with Scotland.[54] English proposals along the same lines were abandoned in 1674 and in 1685.[54] The Scots Parliament rejected proposals for a political union with England in 1689.[54] Jacobitism, the political support for the exiled Catholic Stuart dynasty, remained a threat to the security of the British state under the Protestant House of Orange and the succeeding House of Hanover until the defeat of the Jacobite rising of 1745.[54] In 1698, the Company of Scotland attempted a project to secure a trading colony on the Isthmus of Panama. Almost every Scottish landowner who had money to spare is said to have invested in the Darien scheme.[55][56]  After another proposal from the English House of Lords was rejected in 1695, and a further Lords motion was voted down in the House of Commons in 1700, the Parliament of Scotland again rejected union in 1702.[54] The failure of the Darien Scheme bankrupted the landowners who had invested, though not the burghs. Nevertheless, the nobles' bankruptcy, along with the threat of an English invasion, played a leading role in convincing the Scots elite to back a union with England.[55][56] On 22 July 1706, the Treaty of Union was agreed between representatives of the Scots Parliament and the Parliament of England. The following year, twin Acts of Union were passed by both parliaments to create the united Kingdom of Great Britain with effect from 1 May 1707[57] with popular opposition and anti-union riots in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and elsewhere.[58][59] The union also created the Parliament of Great Britain, which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England, which rejected proposals from the Parliament of Ireland that the third kingdom be incorporated in the union.[54]  With trade tariffs with England abolished, trade blossomed, especially with Colonial America. The clippers belonging to the Glasgow Tobacco Lords were the fastest ships on the route to Virginia. Until the American War of Independence in 1776, Glasgow was the world's premier tobacco port, dominating world trade.[60] The disparity between the wealth of the merchant classes of the Scottish Lowlands and the ancient clans of the Scottish Highlands grew, amplifying centuries of division.  The deposed Jacobite Stuart claimants had remained popular in the Highlands and north-east, particularly among non-Presbyterians, including Roman Catholics and Episcopalian Protestants. Two major Jacobite risings launched in 1715 and 1745 failed to remove the House of Hanover from the British throne. The threat of the Jacobite movement to the United Kingdom and its monarchs effectively ended at the Battle of Culloden, Great Britain's last pitched battle.  In the Highlands, clan chiefs gradually started to think of themselves more as commercial landlords than leaders of their people. These social and economic changes included the first phase of the Highland Clearances and, ultimately, the demise of clanship.[61]:\u200a32\u201353,\u200apassim\u200a  The Scottish Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution turned Scotland into an intellectual, commercial and industrial powerhouse[62] \u2014 so much so Voltaire said \"We look to Scotland for all our ideas of civilisation.\"[63] With the demise of Jacobitism and the advent of the Union, thousands of Scots, mainly Lowlanders, took up numerous positions of power in politics, civil service, the army and navy, trade, economics, colonial enterprises and other areas across the nascent British Empire. Historian Neil Davidson notes \"after 1746 there was an entirely new level of participation by Scots in political life, particularly outside Scotland.\" Davidson also states \"far from being 'peripheral' to the British economy, Scotland \u2013 or more precisely, the Lowlands \u2013 lay at its core.\"[64]  The Scottish Reform Act 1832 increased the number of Scottish MPs and widened the franchise to include more of the middle classes.[65] From the mid-century, there were increasing calls for Home Rule for Scotland and the post of Secretary of State for Scotland was revived.[66] Towards the end of the century Prime Ministers of Scottish descent included William Gladstone,[67] and the Earl of Rosebery.[68] In the late 19th century the growing importance of the working classes was marked by Keir Hardie's success in the Mid Lanarkshire by-election, 1888, leading to the foundation of the Scottish Labour Party, which was absorbed into the Independent Labour Party in 1895, with Hardie as its first leader.[69] Glasgow became one of the largest cities in the world and known as \"the Second City of the Empire\" after London.[70] After 1860, the Clydeside shipyards specialised in steamships made of iron (after 1870, made of steel), which rapidly replaced the wooden sailing vessels of both the merchant fleets and the battle fleets of the world. It became the world's pre-eminent shipbuilding centre.[71] The industrial developments, while they brought work and wealth, were so rapid that housing, town planning, and provision for public health did not keep pace with them, and for a time living conditions in some of the towns and cities were notoriously bad, with overcrowding, high infant mortality, and growing rates of tuberculosis.[72]  While the Scottish Enlightenment is traditionally considered to have concluded toward the end of the 18th century,[73] disproportionately large Scottish contributions to British science and letters continued for another 50 years or more, thanks to such figures as the physicists James Clerk Maxwell and Lord Kelvin, and the engineers and inventors James Watt and William Murdoch, whose work was critical to the technological developments of the Industrial Revolution throughout Britain.[74] In literature, the most successful figure of the mid-19th century was Walter Scott. His first prose work, Waverley in 1814, is often called the first historical novel.[75] It launched a highly successful career that probably more than any other helped define and popularise Scottish cultural identity.[76] In the late 19th century, a number of Scottish-born authors achieved international reputations, such as Robert Louis Stevenson, Arthur Conan Doyle, J. M. Barrie and George MacDonald.[77] Scotland also played a major part in the development of art and architecture. The Glasgow School, which developed in the late 19th century, and flourished in the early 20th century, produced a distinctive blend of influences including the Celtic Revival the Arts and Crafts movement, and Japonism, which found favour throughout the modern art world of continental Europe and helped define the Art Nouveau style. Proponents included architect and artist Charles Rennie Mackintosh.[78]  Scotland played a major role in the British effort in the First World War. It especially provided manpower, ships, machinery, fish and money.[79] With a population of 4.8\u00a0million in 1911, Scotland sent over half a million men to the war, of whom over a quarter died in combat or from disease, and 150,000 were seriously wounded.[80] Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig was Britain's commander on the Western Front. The war saw the emergence of a radical movement called \"Red Clydeside\" led by militant trades unionists. Formerly a Liberal stronghold, the industrial districts switched to Labour by 1922, with a base among the Irish Catholic working-class districts. Women were especially active in building neighbourhood solidarity on housing issues. The \"Reds\" operated within the Labour Party with little influence in Parliament and the mood changed to passive despair by the late 1920s.[81]  During the Second World War, Scotland was targeted by Nazi Germany largely due to its factories, shipyards, and coal mines.[82] Cities such as Glasgow and Edinburgh were targeted by German bombers, as were smaller towns mostly located in the central belt of the country.[82] Perhaps the most significant air raid in Scotland was the Clydebank Blitz of March 1941, which intended to destroy naval shipbuilding in the area.[83] 528 people were killed and 4,000 homes totally destroyed.[83] Perhaps Scotland's most unusual wartime episode occurred in 1941 when Rudolf Hess flew to Renfrewshire, possibly intending to broker a peace deal through the Duke of Hamilton.[84] Before his departure from Germany, Hess had given his adjutant, Karlheinz Pintsch, a letter addressed to Adolf Hitler that detailed his intentions to open peace negotiations with the British. Pintsch delivered the letter to Hitler at the Berghof around noon on 11 May.[85] Albert Speer later said Hitler described Hess's departure as one of the worst personal blows of his life, as he considered it a personal betrayal.[86] Hitler worried that his allies, Italy and Japan, would perceive Hess's act as an attempt by Hitler to secretly open peace negotiations with the British.  After 1945, Scotland's economic situation worsened due to overseas competition, inefficient industry, and industrial disputes.[87] Only in recent decades has the country enjoyed something of a cultural and economic renaissance. Economic factors contributing to this recovery included a resurgent financial services industry, electronics manufacturing, (see Silicon Glen),[88] and the North Sea oil and gas industry.[89] The introduction in 1989 by Margaret Thatcher's government of the Community Charge (widely known as the Poll Tax) one year before the rest of Great Britain,[90] contributed to a growing movement for Scottish control over domestic affairs.[91]  Following a referendum on devolution proposals in 1997, the Scotland Act 1998[92] was passed by the British Parliament, which established a devolved Scottish Parliament and Scottish Government with responsibility for most laws specific to Scotland.[93] The Scottish Parliament was reconvened in Edinburgh on 4 July 1999.[94] The first to hold the office of first minister of Scotland was Donald Dewar, who served until his sudden death in 2000.[95]  The Scottish Parliament Building at Holyrood opened in October 2004 after lengthy construction delays and running over budget.[96] The Scottish Parliament's form of proportional representation (the additional member system) resulted in no one party having an overall majority for the first three Scottish parliament elections.  The pro-independence Scottish National Party led by Alex Salmond achieved an overall majority in the 2011 election, winning 69 of the 129 seats available.[97] The success of the SNP in achieving a majority in the Scottish Parliament paved the way for the September 2014 referendum on Scottish independence. The majority voted against the proposition, with 55% voting no to independence.[98] More powers, particularly concerning taxation, were devolved to the Scottish Parliament after the referendum, following cross-party talks in the Smith Commission.  Since the 2014 referendum, events such as the UK leaving the European Union, despite a majority of voters in Scotland voting to remain a member, have led to calls for a second independence referendum. In 2022, the Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain argued the case for the Scottish Government to hold another referendum on the issue, with the Supreme Court later ruling against the argument.[99] Following the Supreme Court decision, the Scottish Government stated that it wished to make amendments to the Scotland Act 1998 that would allow a referendum to be held in 2023.[100]  The mainland of Scotland comprises the northern third of the land mass of the island of Great Britain, which lies off the northwest coast of Continental Europe. The total area is 30,977 square miles (80,231\u00a0km2) with a land area of 30,078 square miles (77,901\u00a0km2),[4] comparable to the size of the Czech Republic. Scotland's only land border is with England, and runs for 96 miles (154\u00a0km) between the basin of the River Tweed on the east coast and the Solway Firth in the west. The Atlantic Ocean borders the west coast and the North Sea is to the east. The island of Ireland lies only 13 miles (21\u00a0km) from the south-western peninsula of Kintyre;[101] Norway is 190 miles (305\u00a0km) to the northeast and the Faroe Islands, 168 miles (270\u00a0km) to the north.  The territorial extent of Scotland is generally that established by the 1237 Treaty of York between Scotland and the Kingdom of England[102] and the 1266 Treaty of Perth between Scotland and Norway.[12] Important exceptions include the Isle of Man, which having been lost to England in the 14th century is now a crown dependency outside of the United Kingdom; the island groups Orkney and Shetland, which were acquired from Norway in 1472;[103] and Berwick-upon-Tweed, lost to England in 1482  The geographical centre of Scotland lies a few miles from the village of Newtonmore in Badenoch.[104] Rising to 4,413 feet (1,345\u00a0m) above sea level, Scotland's highest point is the summit of Ben Nevis, in Lochaber, while Scotland's longest river, the River Tay, flows for a distance of 117 miles (188\u00a0km).[10]  The whole of Scotland was covered by ice sheets during the Pleistocene ice ages and the landscape is much affected by glaciation. From a geological perspective, the country has three main sub-divisions: the Highlands and Islands, the Central Lowlands, and the Southern Uplands.  The Highlands and Islands lie to the north and west of the Highland Boundary Fault, which runs from Arran to Stonehaven. This part of Scotland largely comprises ancient rocks from the Cambrian and Precambrian, which were uplifted during the later Caledonian orogeny. It is interspersed with igneous intrusions of a more recent age, remnants of which formed mountain massifs such as the Cairngorms and Skye Cuillins.[105] In north-eastern mainland Scotland weathering of rock that occurred before the Last Ice Age has shaped much of the landscape.[106]  A significant exception to the above are the fossil-bearing beds of Old Red Sandstones found principally along the Moray Firth coast. The Highlands are generally mountainous and the highest elevations in the British Isles are found here. Scotland has over 790 islands divided into four main groups: Shetland, Orkney, and the Inner Hebrides and Outer Hebrides. There are numerous bodies of freshwater including Loch Lomond and Loch Ness. Some parts of the coastline consist of machair, a low-lying dune pasture land.  The Central Lowlands is a rift valley mainly comprising Paleozoic formations. Many of these sediments have economic significance for it is here that the coal and iron-bearing rocks that fuelled Scotland's industrial revolution are found. This area has also experienced intense volcanism, Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh being the remnant of a once much larger volcano. This area is relatively low-lying, although even here hills such as the Ochils and Campsie Fells are rarely far from view.  The Southern Uplands is a range of hills almost 125 miles (200\u00a0km) long, interspersed with broad valleys. They lie south of a second fault line (the Southern Uplands fault) that runs from Girvan to Dunbar.[107][108][109] The geological foundations largely comprise Silurian deposits laid down some 400 to 500\u00a0million years ago. The high point of the Southern Uplands is Merrick with an elevation of 843\u00a0m (2,766\u00a0ft).[11][110][111][112] The Southern Uplands is home to Scotland's highest village, Wanlockhead (430\u00a0m or 1,411\u00a0ft above sea level).[109]  The climate of most of Scotland is temperate and oceanic, and tends to be very changeable. As it is warmed by the Gulf Stream from the Atlantic, it has much milder winters (but cooler, wetter summers) than areas on similar latitudes, such as Labrador, southern Scandinavia, the Moscow region in Russia, and the Kamchatka Peninsula on the opposite side of Eurasia. Temperatures are generally lower than in the rest of the UK, with the temperature of \u221227.2\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221217.0\u00a0\u00b0F) recorded at Braemar in the Grampian Mountains, on 11 February 1895, the coldest ever recorded anywhere in the UK.[113] Winter maxima average 6\u00a0\u00b0C (43\u00a0\u00b0F) in the Lowlands, with summer maxima averaging 18\u00a0\u00b0C (64\u00a0\u00b0F). The highest temperature recorded was 35.1\u00a0\u00b0C (95.2\u00a0\u00b0F) at Floors Castle, Scottish Borders on 19 July 2022.[114]  The west of Scotland is usually warmer than the east, owing to the influence of Atlantic ocean currents and the colder surface temperatures of the North Sea. Tiree, in the Inner Hebrides, is one of the sunniest places in the country: it had more than 300 hours of sunshine in May 1975.[115] Rainfall varies widely across Scotland. The western highlands of Scotland are the wettest, with annual rainfall in a few places exceeding 3,000\u00a0mm (120\u00a0in).[116] In comparison, much of lowland Scotland receives less than 800\u00a0mm (31\u00a0in) annually.[117] Heavy snowfall is not common in the lowlands, but becomes more common with altitude. Braemar has an average of 59 snow days per year,[118] while many coastal areas average fewer than 10 days of lying snow per year.[117]  Scotland's wildlife is typical of the north-west of Europe, although several of the larger mammals such as the lynx, brown bear, wolf, elk and walrus were hunted to extinction in historic times. There are important populations of seals and internationally significant nesting grounds for a variety of seabirds such as gannets.[119] The golden eagle is something of a national icon.[120]  On the high mountain tops, species including ptarmigan, mountain hare and stoat can be seen in their white colour phase during winter months.[121] Remnants of the native Scots pine forest exist[122] and within these areas the Scottish crossbill, the UK's only endemic bird species and vertebrate, can be found alongside capercaillie, Scottish wildcat, red squirrel and pine marten.[123][124][125] Various animals have been re-introduced, including the white-tailed eagle in 1975, the red kite in the 1980s,[126][127] and there have been experimental projects involving the beaver and wild boar. Today, much of the remaining native Caledonian Forest lies within the Cairngorms National Park and remnants of the forest remain at 84 locations across Scotland. On the west coast, remnants of ancient Celtic Rainforest remain, particularly on the Taynish peninsula in Argyll, these forests are particularly rare due to high rates of deforestation throughout Scottish history.[128][129]  The flora of the country is varied incorporating both deciduous and coniferous woodland as well as moorland and tundra species. Large-scale commercial tree planting and management of upland moorland habitat for the grazing of sheep and field sport activities like deer stalking and driven grouse shooting impacts the distribution of indigenous plants and animals.[130] The UK's tallest tree is a grand fir planted beside Loch Fyne, Argyll in the 1870s, and the Fortingall Yew may be 5,000 years old and is probably the oldest living thing in Europe.[131][132][133] Although the number of native vascular plants is low by world standards, Scotland's substantial bryophyte flora is of global importance.[134][135]  During the 1820s, many Scots migrated from Scotland to countries such as Australia, the United States and Canada, principally from the Highlands which remained poor in comparison to elsewhere in Scotland.[136] The Highlands was the only part of mainland Britain with a recurrent famine.[137] A small range of products were exported from the region, which had negligible industrial production and a continued population growth that tested the subsistence agriculture. These problems, and the desire to improve agriculture and profits were the driving forces of the ongoing Highland Clearances, in which many of the population of the Highlands suffered eviction as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used for sheep farming. The first phase of the clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout Britain. The second phase was driven by overpopulation, the Highland Potato Famine and the collapse of industries that had relied on the wartime economy of the Napoleonic Wars.[138]  The population of Scotland grew steadily in the 19th century, from 1,608,000 in the census of 1801 to 2,889,000 in 1851 and 4,472,000 in 1901.[139] Even with the development of industry, there were not enough good jobs. As a result, during the period 1841\u20131931, about 2 million Scots migrated to North America and Australia, and another 750,000 Scots relocated to England.[140] Caused by the advent of refrigeration and imports of lamb, mutton and wool from overseas, the 1870s brought with them a collapse of sheep prices and an abrupt halt in the previous sheep farming boom.[141]  In August 2012, the Scottish population reached an all-time high of 5.25\u00a0million people.[142] The reasons given were that, in Scotland, births were outnumbering the number of deaths, and immigrants were moving to Scotland from overseas. In 2011, 43,700 people moved from Wales, Northern Ireland or England to live in Scotland.[142] The most recent census in Scotland was conducted by the Scottish Government and the National Records of Scotland in March 2022.[143] The population of Scotland at the 2022 Census was 5,436,600, the highest ever,[144] beating the previous record of 5,295,400 at the 2011 Census. It was 5,062,011 at the 2001 Census.[145] An ONS estimate for mid-2021 was 5,480,000.[146] In the 2011 Census, 62% of Scotland's population stated their national identity as 'Scottish only', 18% as 'Scottish and British', 8% as 'British only', and 4% chose 'other identity only'.[147]  Throughout its history, Scotland has long had a tradition of migration from Scotland and immigration into Scotland. In 2021, the Scottish Government released figures showing that an estimated 41,000 people had immigrated from other international countries into Scotland, while an average of 22,100 people had migrated from Scotland.[148] Scottish Government data from 2002 shows that by 2021, there had been a sharp increase in immigration to Scotland, with 2002 estimates standing at 27,800 immigrants. While immigration had increased from 2002, migration from Scotland had dropped, with 2002 estimates standing at 26,200 people migrating from Scotland.[149]  Although Edinburgh is the capital of Scotland, the largest city is Glasgow, which has just over 584,000 inhabitants. The Greater Glasgow conurbation, with a population of almost 1.2\u00a0million, is home to nearly a quarter of Scotland's population.[150] The Central Belt is where most of the main towns and cities of Scotland are located, including Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, and Perth. Scotland's only major city outside the Central Belt is Aberdeen. The Scottish Lowlands host 80% of the total population, where the Central Belt accounts for 3.5\u00a0million people.  In general, only the more accessible and larger islands remain inhabited. Currently, fewer than 90 remain inhabited. The Southern Uplands is essentially rural and dominated by agriculture and forestry.[151][152] Because of housing problems in Glasgow and Edinburgh, five new towns were designated between 1947 and 1966. They are East Kilbride, Glenrothes, Cumbernauld, Livingston, and Irvine.[153]  The largest council area by population is Glasgow City, with Highland being the largest in terms of geographical area.  Scotland has three officially recognised languages: English, Scots, and Scottish Gaelic.[155][156] Scottish Standard English, a variety of English as spoken in Scotland, is at one end of a bipolar linguistic continuum, with broad Scots at the other.[157] Scottish Standard English may have been influenced to varying degrees by Scots.[158][159] The 2011 census indicated that 63% of the population had \"no skills in Scots\".[160] Others speak Highland English. Gaelic is mostly spoken in the Western Isles, where a large proportion of people still speak it. Nationally, its use is confined to 1% of the population.[161] The number of Gaelic speakers in Scotland dropped from 250,000 in 1881 to 60,000 in 2008.[162]  Immigration since World War II has given Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Dundee small South Asian communities.[163] In 2011, there were an estimated 49,000 ethnically Pakistani people living in Scotland, making them the largest non-White ethnic group.[164] Since the enlargement of the European Union more people from Central and Eastern Europe have moved to Scotland, and the 2011 census indicated that 61,000 Poles live there.[164][165]  There are many more people with Scottish ancestry living abroad than the total population of Scotland. In the 2000 Census, 9.2\u00a0million Americans self-reported some degree of Scottish descent.[166] Ulster's Protestant population is mainly of lowland Scottish descent,[167] and it is estimated that there are more than 27\u00a0million descendants of the Scots-Irish migration now living in the US.[168][169] In Canada, the Scottish-Canadian community accounts for 4.7\u00a0million people.[170] About 20% of the original European settler population of New Zealand came from Scotland.[171]  Forms of Christianity have dominated religious life in what is now Scotland for more than 1,400 years.[172][173] In 2011 just over half (54%) of the Scottish population reported being a Christian while nearly 37% reported not having a religion.[174] Since the Scottish Reformation of 1560, the national church (the Church of Scotland, also known as The Kirk) has been Protestant in classification and Reformed in theology. Since 1689 it has had a Presbyterian system of church government independent from the state.[11] Its membership dropped just below 300,000 in 2020 (5% of the total population)[175][176][177] The Church operates a territorial parish structure, with every community in Scotland having a local congregation.  Scotland also has a significant Roman Catholic population, 19% professing that faith, particularly in Greater Glasgow and the north-west.[178] After the Reformation, Roman Catholicism in Scotland continued in the Highlands and some western islands like Uist and Barra, and it was strengthened during the 19th century by immigration from Ireland. Other Christian denominations in Scotland include the Free Church of Scotland, and various other Presbyterian offshoots. Scotland's third largest church is the Scottish Episcopal Church.[179]  There are an estimated 75,000 Muslims in Scotland (about 1.4% of the population),[174][180] and significant but smaller Jewish, Hindu and Sikh communities, especially in Glasgow.[180] The Samy\u00e9 Ling monastery near Eskdalemuir, which celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2007, is the first Buddhist monastery in western Europe.[181]  The Scottish education system has always had a characteristic emphasis on a broad education.[183] In the 15th century, the Humanist emphasis on education cumulated with the passing of the Education Act 1496, which decreed that all sons of barons and freeholders of substance should attend grammar schools to learn \"perfyct Latyne\", resulting in an increase in literacy among a male and wealthy elite.[184] In the Reformation, the 1560 First Book of Discipline set out a plan for a school in every parish, but this proved financially impossible.[185] In 1616 an act in Privy council commanded every parish to establish a school.[186] By the late seventeenth century there was a largely complete network of parish schools in the lowlands, but in the Highlands basic education was still lacking in many areas.[187] Education remained a matter for the church rather than the state until the Education (Scotland) Act 1872.[188]  Education in Scotland is the responsibility of the Scottish Government and is overseen by its executive agency Education Scotland.[189] The Curriculum for Excellence, Scotland's national school curriculum, presently provides the curricular framework for children and young people from age 3 to 18.[190] All 3- and 4-year-old children in Scotland are entitled to a free nursery place. Formal primary education begins at approximately 5 years old and lasts for 7 years (P1\u2013P7); children in Scotland study National Qualifications of the Curriculum for Excellence between the ages of 14 and 18. The school leaving age is 16, after which students may choose to remain at school and study further qualifications. A small number of students at certain private schools may follow the English system and study towards GCSEs and A and AS-Levels instead.[191]  There are fifteen Scottish universities, some of which are among the oldest in the world.[192][193] The four universities founded before the end of the 16th century \u2013 the University of St Andrews, the University of Glasgow, the University of Aberdeen and the University of Edinburgh \u2013 are collectively known as the ancient universities of Scotland, all of which rank among the 200 best universities in the world in the THE rankings, with Edinburgh placing in the top 50.[194] Scotland had more universities per capita in QS' World University Rankings' top 100 in 2012 than any other nation.[195] The country produces 1% of the world's published research with less than 0.1% of the world's population, and higher education institutions account for 9% of Scotland's service sector exports.[196][197] Scotland's University Courts are the only bodies in Scotland authorised to award degrees.  Health care in Scotland is mainly provided by NHS Scotland, Scotland's public health care system. This was founded by the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1947 (later repealed by the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978) that took effect on 5 July 1948 to coincide with the launch of the NHS in England and Wales. Prior to 1948, half of Scotland's landmass was already covered by state-funded health care, provided by the Highlands and Islands Medical Service.[199] Healthcare policy and funding is the responsibility of the Scottish Government's Health Directorates. In 2014, the NHS in Scotland had around 140,000 staff.[200]  The total fertility rate (TFR) in Scotland is below the replacement rate of 2.1 (the TFR was 1.73 in 2011[201]). The majority of births are to unmarried women (51.3% of births were outside of marriage in 2012[202]).  Life expectancy for those born in Scotland between 2012 and 2014 is 77.1 years for males and 81.1 years for females.[203] This is the lowest of any of the four countries of the UK.[203] The number of hospital admissions in Scotland for diseases such as cancer was 2,528 in 2002. Over the next ten years, by 2012, this had increased to 2,669.[204] Hospital admissions for other diseases, such as coronary heart disease (CHD) were lower, with 727 admissions in 2002, and decreasing to 489 in 2012.[204]  Scotland is part of the United Kingdom, a constitutional monarchy whose current sovereign is Charles III.[205] The monarchy uses a variety of styles, titles and other symbols specific to Scotland, most of which originated in the pre-Union Kingdom of Scotland. These include the Royal Standard of Scotland, the royal coat of arms, and the title Duke of Rothesay, which is traditionally given to the heir apparent. There are also distinct Scottish Officers of State and Officers of the Crown, and the Order of the Thistle, a chivalric order, is specific to the country.[206]  The Parliament of the United Kingdom and the Parliament of Scotland are the country's primary legislative bodies. The UK Parliament is sovereign and therefore has supremacy over the Scottish Parliament,[207] but generally restricts itself to legislating over reserved matters: primarily taxes, social security, defence, international relations, and broadcasting.[208] There is a convention the UK Parliament will not legislate over devolved matters without the Scottish Parliament's consent.[209] Scotland is represented in the House of Commons, the lower chamber of the UK Parliament, by 59 Members of Parliament (out of a total of 650).[210] They are elected to single-member constituencies under the first-past-the-post system of voting. The Scotland Office represents the British government in Scotland and represents Scottish interests within the government.[211] The Scotland Office is led by the Secretary of State for Scotland, who sits in the Cabinet of the United Kingdom.[212] The Conservative MP Alister Jack has held the position since July 2019.[212]  The Scottish Parliament is a unicameral legislature with 129 members (MSPs): 73 of them represent individual constituencies and are elected on a first-past-the-post system, and the other 56 are elected in eight different electoral regions by the additional member system. MSPs normally serve for a five-year period.[213] The largest party since the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, has been the Scottish National Party (SNP), which won 64 of the 129 seats.[214] The Scottish Conservatives, Scottish Labour, the Scottish Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Greens also have representation in the current Parliament.[214] The next Scottish Parliament election is due to be held on 7 May 2026.[215] The Scottish Government is led by the First Minister, who is nominated by MSPs and is typically the leader of the largest party in the Parliament. Other ministers are appointed by the first minister and serve at their discretion.[216] Since March 2023 the first minister has been Humza Yousaf, the leader of the SNP.  Within the UK, the First Minister is a member of the Heads of Government Council, the body which facilitates intergovernmental relations between the Scottish Government, UK Government, Welsh Government, and Northern Ireland Executive.[217] Foreign policy is a reserved matter and primarily the responsibility of the Foreign Office, a department of the UK Government.[218] Nevertheless, the Scottish Government may promote Scottish interests abroad and encourage foreign investment in Scotland.[219] The First Minister, Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs,[220] and the Minister for International Development and Europe all have portfolios which include foreign affairs.[221][222]  Scotland's international network consists of two Scotland Houses, one in Brussels and the other in London, seven Scottish Government international offices, and over thirty Scottish Development International offices in other countries globally. Both Scotland Houses are independent Scottish Government establishments, whilst the seven Scottish Government international offices are based in British embassies or British High Commission offices.[223] The Scottish Government, along with the other devolved governments of the United Kingdom, pay the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office an annual charge to be able to access facilities and support in the Embassy or High Commission in which the Scottish international offices are based. The Scottish Government's international network allows Scottish Government ministers to engage with other international governments and bodies in relation to the government's policy objectives as well as that of Scottish businesses. Additionally, the international network of the Scottish Government acts as a mechanism to promote and strengthen the Scottish economy by creating opportunities for Scottish businesses to increase export sales of Scottish products, whilst working with their current, and any future, foreign investors to establish and maintain Scottish jobs in the goods sector.[223]  Scotland is a member of the British\u2013Irish Council and the British\u2013Irish Parliamentary Assembly, both of which are intended to foster collaboration between the legislative bodies of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.[224][225] The Scottish Government has a network of offices in Beijing, Berlin, Brussels, Copenhagen, Dublin, London, Ottawa, Paris, and Washington, D.C, which promote Scottish interests in their respective areas.[226] The nation has historic ties to France as a result of the 'Auld Alliance', a treaty signed between the Kingdom of Scotland and Kingdom of France in 1295 to discourage an English invasion of either country.[227] The alliance effectively ended in the sixteenth century, but the two countries continue to have a close relationship, with a Statement of Intent being signed in 2013 between the Scottish Government and the Government of France.[228] In 2004 the Scotland Malawi Partnership was established, which co-ordinates Scottish activities to strengthen existing links with Malawi, and in 2021, the Scottish Government and Government of Ireland signed the Ireland-Scotland Bilateral Review, committing both governments to increased levels of co\u2013operation on areas such as diplomacy, economy and business.[223][229][230] Scotland also has historical and cultural ties with the Scandinavian countries.[231][232] Scottish Government policy advocates for stronger political relations with the Nordic and Baltic countries, which has resulted in some Nordic-inspired policies being adopted such as baby boxes.[233][234] Representatives from the Scottish Parliament attended the Nordic Council for the first time in 2022.[235]  Devolution\u2014the granting of central government powers to a regional government[236]\u2013 gained increasing popularity as a policy in the United Kingdom the late twentieth century; it was described by John Smith, then Leader of the Labour Party, as the \"settled will of the Scottish people\".[237] The Scottish Parliament and Scottish Government were subsequently established under the Scotland Act 1998; the Act followed a successful referendum in 1997 which found majority support for both creating the Parliament and granting it limited powers to vary income tax.[238] The Act enabled the new institutions to legislate in all areas not explicitly reserved by the UK Parliament.[239]  Two more pieces of legislation, the Scotland Acts of 2012 and 2016, gave the Scottish Parliament further powers to legislate on taxation and social security;[240] the 2016 Act also gave the Scottish Government powers to manage the affairs of the Crown Estate in Scotland.[241] Conversely, the United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020 constrains the Scottish Parliament's autonomy to regulate goods and services,[242][243] and the academic view is that this undermines devolution.[249]  The 2007 Scottish Parliament elections led to the Scottish National Party (SNP), which supports Scottish independence, forming a minority government. The new government established a \"National Conversation\" on constitutional issues, proposing a number of options such as increasing the powers of the Scottish Parliament, federalism, or a referendum on Scottish independence from the United Kingdom. The three main unionist opposition parties\u2013Scottish Labour, the Scottish Conservatives, and the Scottish Liberal Democrats\u2013created a separate commission to investigate the distribution of powers between devolved Scottish and UK-wide bodies while not considering independence.[250] In August 2009 the SNP proposed a bill to hold a referendum on independence in November 2010, but was defeated by opposition from all other major parties.[251][252][253]  The 2011 Scottish Parliament election resulted in an SNP overall majority in the Scottish Parliament, and on 18 September 2014 a referendum on Scottish independence was held.[254] The referendum resulted in a rejection of independence, by 55.3% to 44.7%.[255][256] During the campaign, the three main parties in the British Parliament\u2013the Conservatives, Labour, and the Liberal Democrats\u2013pledged to extend the powers of the Scottish Parliament.[257][258] An all-party commission chaired by Robert Smith, Baron Smith of Kelvin was formed,[258] which led to the Scotland Act 2016.[259]  Following the European Union Referendum Act 2015, the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum was held on 23 June 2016 on Britain's membership of the European Union. A majority in the United Kingdom voted to withdraw from the EU, while a majority within Scotland voted to remain a member.[260] The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, announced the following day that as a result a new independence referendum was \"highly likely\".[261][260] On 31 January 2020, the United Kingdom formally withdrew from the European Union. Because constitutional affairs are reserved matters under the Scotland Act, the Scottish Parliament would again have to be granted temporary additional powers under Section 30 to hold a legally binding vote.[262][263][264]  For local government purposes Scotland is subdivided into 32 single-tier council areas.[265] The areas were established in 1996, and their councils are responsible for the provision of all local government services. Decisions are made by councillors, who are elected at local elections every five years. The leader of the council is typically a councillor from the party with the most seats; councils also have a civic head, typically called the provost or lord provost, who represents the council on ceremonial occasions and chairs council meetings.[266] Community Councils are informal organisations that represent smaller subdivisions within each council area.[267]  Police Scotland and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service cover the entire country. For healthcare and postal districts, and a number of other governmental and non-governmental organisations such as the churches, there are other long-standing methods of subdividing Scotland for the purposes of administration.  There are eight cities in Scotland: Aberdeen, Dundee, Dunfermline, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness, Stirling and Perth.[268] City status in the United Kingdom is conferred by the monarch through letters patent.[269]  As one of the countries of the United Kingdom, the British Armed Forces are the armed forces of Scotland. Of the money spent on UK defence, about \u00a33.3\u00a0billion can be attributed to Scotland as of 2018\/2019.[270] Scotland had a long military tradition predating the Treaty of Union with England. Following the Treaty of Union in 1707, the Scots Army and Royal Scots Navy merged with their English counterparts to form the Royal Navy and the British Army, which together form part of the British Armed Forces.[271][272] The Atholl Highlanders, Europe's only remaining legal private army, did not join the Scots Army or Royal Scots Navy in merging with English armed forces, remaining a private army not under the command of the British Armed Forces.[273]   Numerous Scottish regiments have at various times existed in the British Army. Distinctively Scottish regiments in the British Army include the Scots Guards, the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards and the 154 (Scottish) Regiment RLC, an Army Reserve regiment of the Royal Logistic Corps. In 2006, as a result of the Delivering Security in a Changing World white paper, the Scottish infantry regiments in the Scottish Division were amalgamated to form the Royal Regiment of Scotland.[274]  As a result of the Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition's Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010, the Scottish regiments of the line in the British Army infantry, having previously formed the Scottish Division, were reorganised into the Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division in 2017. Before the formation of the Scottish Division, the Scottish infantry was organised into a Lowland Brigade and Highland Brigade.[275] Because of their topography and perceived remoteness, parts of Scotland have housed many sensitive defence establishments.[276][277][278] Between 1960 and 1991, the Holy Loch was a base for the US fleet of Polaris ballistic missile submarines.[279] Today, Her Majesty's Naval Base Clyde, 25 miles (40 kilometres) north-west of Glasgow, is the base for the four Trident-armed Vanguard-class ballistic missile submarines that comprise the Britain's nuclear deterrent.  Scotland's Scapa Flow was the main base for the Royal Navy in the 20th century.[280] As the Cold War intensified in 1961, the United States deployed Polaris ballistic missiles, and submarines, in the Firth of Clyde's Holy Loch. Public protests from CND campaigners proved futile. The Royal Navy successfully convinced the government to allow the base because it wanted its own Polaris submarines, and it obtained them in 1963. The RN's nuclear submarine base opened with four Resolution-class Polaris submarines at the expanded Faslane Naval Base on the Gare Loch. The first patrol of a Trident-armed submarine occurred in 1994, although the US base was closed at the end of the Cold War.[281]  A single front-line Royal Air Force base is located in Scotland. RAF Lossiemouth, located in Moray, is the most northerly air defence fighter base in the United Kingdom and is home to four Eurofighter Typhoon combat aircraft squadrons, three Poseidon MRA1 squadrons, and a full\u2013time, permanently based RAF Regiment squadron.[282]  Scots law has a basis derived from Roman law,[283] combining features of both uncodified civil law, dating back to the Corpus Juris Civilis, and common law with medieval sources. The terms of the Treaty of Union with England in 1707 guaranteed the continued existence of a separate legal system in Scotland from that of England and Wales.[284] Prior to 1611, there were several regional law systems in Scotland, most notably Udal law in Orkney and Shetland, based on old Norse law. Various other systems derived from common Celtic or Brehon laws survived in the Highlands until the 1800s.[285] Scots law provides for three types of courts responsible for the administration of justice: civil, criminal and heraldic. The supreme civil court is the Court of Session, although civil appeals can be taken to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (or before 1 October 2009, the House of Lords). The High Court of Justiciary is the supreme criminal court in Scotland. The Court of Session is housed at Parliament House, in Edinburgh, which was the home of the pre-Union Parliament of Scotland with the High Court of Justiciary and the Supreme Court of Appeal currently located at the Lawnmarket. The sheriff court is the main criminal and civil court, hearing most cases. There are 49 sheriff courts throughout the country.[286] District courts were introduced in 1975 for minor offences and small claims. These were gradually replaced by Justice of the Peace Courts from 2008 to 2010.  For three centuries the Scots legal system was unique for being the only national legal system without a parliament. This ended with the advent of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, which legislates for devolved matters.[287] Many features within the system have been preserved. Within criminal law, the Scots legal system is unique in having three possible verdicts: \"guilty\", \"not guilty\" and \"not proven\".[288] Both \"not guilty\" and \"not proven\" result in an acquittal, typically with no possibility of retrial per the rule of double jeopardy. A retrial can hear new evidence at a later date that might have proven conclusive in the earlier trial at first instance, where the person acquitted subsequently admits the offence or where it can be proved that the acquittal was tainted by an attempt to pervert the course of justice. Scots juries, sitting in criminal cases, consist of fifteen jurors, which is three more than is typical in many countries.[289]  The Lord Advocate is the chief legal officer of the Scottish Government and the Crown in Scotland. The Lord Advocate is the head of the systems in Scotland for the investigation and prosecution of crime, the investigation of deaths as well as serving as the principal legal adviser to the Scottish Government and representing the government in legal proceedings.[290] They are the chief public prosecutor for Scotland and all prosecutions on indictment are conducted by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service in the Lord Advocate's name on behalf of the Monarch.[290] The officeholder is one of the Great Officers of State of Scotland. The current Lord Advocate is Dorothy Bain, who was nominated by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and appointed in June 2021.[291] The Lord Advocate is supported by the Solicitor General for Scotland.[292]  Since 2013, Scotland has had a unified police force known as Police Scotland. The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) manages the prisons in Scotland, which collectively house over 8,500 prisoners.[293] The Cabinet Secretary for Justice and Home Affairs is responsible for the Scottish Prison Service within the Scottish Government.  Scotland has a Western-style open mixed economy closely linked with the rest of the UK and the wider world. Scotland is one of the leading financial centres in Europe, and is the largest financial centre in the United Kingdom outside of London.[295] Edinburgh is the financial services centre of Scotland, with many large finance firms based there, including: Lloyds Banking Group, the Bank of Scotland, the Government-owned Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Life.[296] Edinburgh was ranked 15th in the list of world financial centres in 2007, but fell to 37th in 2012, following damage to its reputation,[297] and in 2016 was ranked 56th out of 86.[298] Its status had returned to 17th by 2020.[299] Traditionally, the Scottish economy was dominated by heavy industry underpinned by shipbuilding in Glasgow, coal mining and steel industries. Petroleum-related industries associated with the extraction of North Sea oil have also been important employers from the 1970s, especially in the north-east of Scotland. De-industrialisation during the 1970s and 1980s saw a shift from a manufacturing focus towards a more service-oriented economy. The Scottish National Investment Bank was established by the Scottish Government in 2020, which uses public money to fund commercial projects across Scotland with the hope that this seed capital will encourage further private investment, to help develop a fairer, more sustainable economy. \u00a32\u00a0billion of taxpayers money was earmarked for the bank.[300]  In 2022, Scotland's gross domestic product (GDP), including offshore oil and gas, was estimated at \u00a3211.7\u00a0billion.[7] In 2021, Scottish exports in goods and services (excluding intra-UK trade) were estimated to be \u00a350.1 billion.[301] Scotland's primary goods exports are mineral fuels, machinery and transport, and beverages and tobacco.[302] The country's largest export markets in goods are the European Union, Asia and Oceania, and North America.[302] Whisky is one of Scotland's more known goods of economic activity. Exports increased by 87% in the decade to 2012[303] and were valued at \u00a34.3\u00a0billion in 2013, which was 85% of Scotland's food and drink exports.[304] It supports around 10,000 jobs directly and 25,000 indirectly.[305] It may contribute \u00a3400\u2013682\u00a0million to Scotland, rather than several billion pounds, as more than 80% of whisky produced is owned by non-Scottish companies.[306] A briefing published in 2002 by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe) for the Scottish Parliament's Enterprise and Life Long Learning Committee stated that tourism accounted for up to 5% of GDP and 7.5% of employment.[307]  Scotland was one of the industrial powerhouses of Europe from the time of the Industrial Revolution onwards, being a world leader in manufacturing.[308] This left a legacy in the diversity of goods and services which Scotland produces, from textiles, whisky and shortbread to jet engines, buses, computer software, investment management and other related financial services.[309] In common with most other advanced industrialised economies, Scotland has seen a decline in the importance of both manufacturing industries and primary-based extractive industries. This has been combined with a rise in the service sector of the economy, which has grown to be the largest sector in Scotland.[310]  The average weekly income for workplace-based employees in Scotland is \u00a3573,[311] and \u00a3576 for residence based employees.[311] Scotland has the third highest median gross salary in the United Kingdom at \u00a326,007 and is higher than the overall UK average annual salary of \u00a325,971.[312] With an average of \u00a314.28, Scotland has the third highest median hourly rate (excluding overtime working hours) of any of the countries of the United Kingdom, and like the annual salary, is higher than the average UK figure as a whole.[312] The highest paid industries in Scotland tend of be in the utility electricity, gas and air conditioning sectors,[312] with industries like tourism, accommodation and food and drink tend to be the lowest paid.[312] The top local authority for pay by where people live is East Renfrewshire (\u00a320.87 per hour).[312]  The top local authority for pay based on where people work is East Ayrshire (\u00a316.92 per hour). Scotland's cities commonly have the largest salaries in Scotland for where people work.[312] 2021\/2022 date indicates that there were 2.6 million dwellings across Scotland, with 318,369 local authority dwellings.[313] Typical prices for a house in Scotland was \u00a3195,391 in August 2022.[314]  Between 2016 and 2020, the Scottish Government estimated that 10% of people in Scotland were in persistent poverty following housing costs, with similar rates of persistent poverty for children (10%), working-age adults (10%) and pensioners (11%).[315] Persistent child poverty rates had seen a relatively sharp drop, however, the accuracy of this was deemed to be questionable due to a number of various factors such as households re-entering the longitudinal sample allowing data gaps to be filled.[315] The Scottish Government introduced the Scottish Child Payment in 2021 for low-income families with children under six years of age in an attempt to reduce child poverty rates, with families receiving a payment of roughly \u00a31,040 per year.[316] As of October 2023, 10% of the Scottish population were estimated to be living in poverty.[317]  Although the Bank of England is the central bank for the UK, three Scottish clearing banks issue Sterling banknotes: the Bank of Scotland, the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Clydesdale Bank. The issuing of banknotes by retail banks in Scotland is subject to the Banking Act 2009, which repealed all earlier legislation under which banknote issuance was regulated, and the Scottish and Northern Ireland Banknote Regulations 2009.[318]  The value of the Scottish banknotes in circulation in 2013 was \u00a33.8\u00a0billion, underwritten by the Bank of England using funds deposited by each clearing bank, under the Banking Act 2009, to cover the total value of such notes in circulation.[319]  Scotland has five international airports operating scheduled services to Europe, North America and Asia, as well as domestic services to England, Northern Ireland and Wales.[320] Highlands and Islands Airports operates eleven airports across the Highlands, Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles, which are primarily used for short distance, public service operations, although Inverness Airport has a number of scheduled flights to destinations across the UK and mainland Europe.[321] Edinburgh Airport is currently Scotland's busiest airport handling over 13 million passengers in 2017.[322] It is also the UK's 6th busiest airport. The airline Loganair has its headquarters at Glasgow Airport and markets itself as Scotland's Airline.[323]  Network Rail owns and operates the fixed infrastructure assets of the railway system in Scotland, while the Scottish Government retains overall responsibility for rail strategy and funding in Scotland.[324] Scotland's rail network has 359 railway stations and around 1,710 miles (2,760\u00a0km) of track.[325] In 2018\u201319 there were 102\u00a0million passenger journeys on Scottish railways.[326] On 1 January 2006, Transport Scotland was established, which would oversee the regulation of railways in Scotland and administer major rail projects.[327] Since April 2022, Transport Scotland has taken ScotRail back into public ownership via its operator of last resort, Scottish Rail Holdings.[328] It did the same with the Caledonian Sleeper service in June 2023.[329]  The Glasgow Subway is the only underground system in Scotland. It opened on 14 December 1896, making it the third-oldest underground network in the world after the Budapest Metro and the London Underground. It is owned and operated by Strathclyde Partnership for Transport.[330]  The Scottish motorways and major trunk roads are managed by Transport Scotland. The remainder of the road network is managed by the Scottish local authorities in each of their areas.  Regular ferry services operate between the Scottish mainland and outlying islands. Ferries serving both the inner and outer Hebrides are principally operated by the state-owned enterprise Caledonian MacBrayne.[331][332] Services to the Northern Isles are operated by Serco. Other routes, such as southwest Scotland to Northern Ireland, are served by multiple companies.[333] DFDS Seaways operated a freight-only Rosyth \u2013 Zeebrugge ferry service, until a fire damaged the vessel DFDS were using.[334] A passenger service was also operated between 2002 and 2010.[335]  Scotland's primary sources of energy are provided through renewable energy (61.8%), nuclear (25.7%) and fossil fuel generation (10.9%).[337] Whitelee Wind Farm is the largest onshore wind farm in the United Kingdom, and was Europe's largest onshore wind farm for some time.[338] Tidal power is an emerging source of energy in Scotland. The MeyGen tidal stream energy plant in the north of the country is claimed to be the largest tidal stream energy project in the world.[339] In Scotland, 98.6% of all electricity used was from renewable sources. This is minus net exports.[337] Between October 2021 and September 2022 63.1% of all electricity generated in Scotland was from renewable sources, 83.6% was classed as low carbon and 14.5% was from fossil fuels.[340] The Scottish Government has a target to have the equivalent of 50% of the energy for Scotland's heat, transport and electricity consumption to be supplied from renewable sources by 2030.[341] They have stated that, in 2022, the equivalent of 113% of the country's overall electrical consumption was produced by renewable energy, making it the highest recorded figure of renewable energy generated to date.[342]  Scotland's inventions and discoveries are said to have revolutionised human technology and have played a major role in the creation of the modern world. Such inventions \u2013 the television, the telephone, refrigerators, the MRI scanner, flushing toilets and the steam engine \u2013 are said to have been possible by Scotland's universities and parish schools, together with the commitment Scots had to education during the Scottish Enlightenment.[343] Alexander Fleming is responsible for the discovery of the world's first broadly effective antibiotic substance, which he named penicillin, earning him a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1945.[344][345][346] Modern Scottish inventions \u2013 the Falkirk Wheel and the Glasgow Tower \u2013 hold world records for being the only rotating boat lift and the tallest fully rotating freestanding structure in the world respectively.[347][348]  Scotland's space industry is a world leader in sustainable space technology,[349][350] and, according to the UK Space Agency, there are 173 space companies currently operating in Scotland as of May 2021.[351] These include spacecraft manufacturers, launch providers, downstream data analyzers, and research organisations.[352] The space industry in Scotland is projected to generate \u00a32billion in income for Scotland's space cluster by 2030.[349] Scottish space industry jobs represent almost 1 in 5 of all UK space industry employment.[353] In addition to its space industry, Scotland is home to two planned spaceports \u2013 Sutherland spaceport and SaxaVord Spaceport \u2013 with launch vehicles such as the Orbex Prime from Scottish\u2013based aerospace company Orbex expected to be launched from Sutherland.[354]  Scottish music is a significant aspect of the nation's culture, with both traditional and modern influences. A famous traditional Scottish instrument is the Great Highland bagpipe, a woodwind reed instrument consisting of three drones and a melody pipe (called the chanter), which are fed continuously by a reservoir of air in a bag. The popularity of pipe bands\u2014primarily featuring bagpipes, various types of snares and drums, and showcasing Scottish traditional dress and music\u2014has spread throughout the world. Bagpipes are featured in holiday celebrations, parades, funerals, weddings, and other events internationally. Many military regiments have a pipe band of their own. In addition to the Great Highland pipes, several smaller, somewhat quieter bellows-blown varieties of bagpipe are played in Scotland, including the smallpipes and the Border pipes.  Scottish popular music has gained an international following, with artists such as Lewis Capaldi, Amy Macdonald, KT Tunstall, Nina Nesbitt, Chvrches, Gerry Cinnamon and Paolo Nutini gaining international success. DJ Calvin Harris was one of the most streamed artists on Spotify in 2023,[355][356] whilst Susan Boyle's debut album was one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century, and was the best-selling album internationally in 2009.[357] Musical talent in Scotland is recognised via the Scottish Music Awards, Scottish Album of the Year Award, the Scots Trad Music Awards and the BBC Radio Scotland Young Traditional Musician award.  Scotland has a literary heritage dating back to the early Middle Ages. The earliest extant literature composed in what is now Scotland was in Brythonic speech in the 6th century, but is preserved as part of Welsh literature.[358] Later medieval literature included works in Latin,[359] Gaelic,[360] Old English[361] and French.[362] The first surviving major text in Early Scots is the 14th-century poet John Barbour's epic Brus, focusing on the life of Robert I,[363] and was soon followed by a series of vernacular romances and prose works.[364] In the 16th century, the crown's patronage helped the development of Scots drama and poetry,[365] but the accession of James VI to the English throne removed a major centre of literary patronage and Scots was sidelined as a literary language.[366] Interest in Scots literature was revived in the 18th century by figures including James Macpherson, whose Ossian Cycle made him the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation and was a major influence on the European Enlightenment.[367] It was also a major influence on Robert Burns, whom many consider the national poet,[368] and Walter Scott, whose Waverley Novels did much to define Scottish identity in the 19th century.[369] Towards the end of the Victorian era a number of Scottish-born authors achieved international reputations as writers in English, including Robert Louis Stevenson, Arthur Conan Doyle, J. M. Barrie and George MacDonald.[370]  In the 20th century the Scottish Renaissance saw a surge of literary activity and attempts to reclaim the Scots language as a medium for serious literature.[371] Members of the movement were followed by a new generation of post-war poets including Edwin Morgan, who would be appointed the first Scots Makar by the inaugural Scottish government in 2004.[372] Sorley MacLean was described by the Scottish Poetry Library as \"one of the major Scottish poets of the modern era\" because of his \"mastery of his chosen medium and his engagement with the European poetic tradition and European politics\".[373] Nobel Prize Laureate Seamus Heaney credited MacLean with saving Scottish Gaelic poetry.[374] From the 1980s Scottish literature enjoyed another major revival, particularly associated with a group of writers including Irvine Welsh.[371] Scottish poets who emerged in the same period included Carol Ann Duffy, who, in May 2009, was the first Scot named the monarch's Poet Laureate.[375]  National newspapers such as the Daily Record, The Herald, The Scotsman and The National are all produced in Scotland.[376] Important regional dailies include the Evening News in Edinburgh, The Courier in Dundee in the east, and The Press and Journal serving Aberdeen and the north.[376] Scotland is represented at the Celtic Media Festival, which showcases film and television from the Celtic countries. Scottish entrants have won many awards since the festival began in 1980.[377]  Scotland's national broadcaster is BBC Scotland, a division of the BBC, which runs three national television stations BBC One Scotland, BBC Scotland channel and the Gaelic-language broadcaster BBC Alba, and the national radio stations, BBC Radio Scotland and BBC Radio nan G\u00e0idheal, among others. The main Scottish commercial television station is STV which broadcasts on two of the three ITV regions of Scotland.[378]  As one of the Celtic nations, Scotland and Scottish culture are represented at inter-Celtic events at home and over the world. Scotland hosts several music festivals including Celtic Connections (Glasgow), and the Hebridean Celtic Festival (Stornoway). Festivals celebrating Celtic culture, such as Festival Interceltique de Lorient (Brittany), the Pan Celtic Festival (Ireland), and the National Celtic Festival (Portarlington, Australia), feature elements of Scottish culture such as language, music and dance.[379][380][381][382]  The image of St. Andrew, martyred while bound to an X-shaped cross, first appeared in the Kingdom of Scotland during the reign of William I.[383] Following the death of King Alexander III in 1286 an image of Andrew was used on the seal of the Guardians of Scotland who assumed control of the kingdom during the subsequent interregnum.[384] Use of a simplified symbol associated with Saint Andrew, the saltire, has its origins in the late 14th century; the Parliament of Scotland decreeing in 1385 that Scottish soldiers should wear a white Saint Andrew's Cross on the front and back of their tunics.[385] Use of a blue background for the Saint Andrew's Cross is said to date from at least the 15th century.[386] Since 1606 the saltire has also formed part of the design of the Union Flag. There are numerous other symbols and symbolic artefacts, both official and unofficial, including the thistle, the nation's floral emblem (celebrated in the song, The Thistle o' Scotland), the Declaration of Arbroath, incorporating a statement of political independence made on 6 April 1320, the textile pattern tartan that often signifies a particular Scottish clan and the royal Lion Rampant flag.[387][388][389] Highlanders can thank James Graham, 3rd Duke of Montrose, for the repeal in 1782 of the Act of 1747 prohibiting the wearing of tartans.[390]  Although there is no official national anthem of Scotland,[391] Flower of Scotland is played on special occasions and sporting events such as football and rugby matches involving the Scotland national teams and since 2010 is also played at the Commonwealth Games after it was voted the overwhelming favourite by participating Scottish athletes.[392] Other currently less popular candidates for the National Anthem of Scotland include Scotland the Brave, Highland Cathedral, Scots Wha Hae and A Man's A Man for A' That.[393]  St Andrew's Day, 30 November, is the national day, although Burns' Night tends to be more widely observed, particularly outside Scotland. In 2006, the Scottish Parliament passed the St Andrew's Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Act 2007, designating the day an official bank holiday.[394] Tartan Day is a recent innovation from Canada.[395]  The national animal of Scotland is the unicorn, which has been a Scottish heraldic symbol since the 12th century.[396] The Court of the Lord Lyon regulates Scottish heraldry and the Public Register of All Armorial Bearings in Scotland.[397]  Scottish cuisine has distinctive attributes and recipes of its own but shares much with wider British and European cuisine as a result of local and foreign influences, both ancient and modern. Traditional Scottish dishes exist alongside international foodstuffs brought about by migration. Scotland's natural larder of game, dairy products, fish, fruit, and vegetables is the chief factor in traditional Scots cooking, with a high reliance on simplicity and a lack of spices from abroad, as these were historically rare and expensive.[398]  Irn-Bru is the most common Scottish carbonated soft drink, often described as \"Scotland's other national drink\" (after whisky).[399] During the Late Middle Ages and early modern era, French cuisine played a role in Scottish cookery due to cultural exchanges brought about by the \"Auld Alliance\",[400] especially during the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots. Mary, on her return to Scotland, brought an entourage of French staff who are considered responsible for revolutionising Scots cooking and for some of Scotland's unique food terminology.[401]  Scotland hosts its own national sporting competitions and has independent representation at several international sporting events, including the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Nations League, the UEFA European Championship, the Rugby Union World Cup, the Rugby League World Cup, the Cricket World Cup, the Netball World Cup and the Commonwealth Games. Scotland has its own national governing bodies, such as the Scottish Football Association (the second oldest national football association in the world)[402] and the Scottish Rugby Union. Variations of football have been played in Scotland for centuries, with the earliest reference dating back to 1424.[403]  The world's first official international association football match, between Scotland and England was held in Glasgow on 30 November 1872, and resulted in a 0\u20130 draw.[404] The Scottish Cup was first contested in 1873, and is the oldest trophy in association football.[405] The Scottish Football Association (SFA) is the main governing body for Scottish association football, and a founding member of the International Football Association Board (IFAB) which governs the Laws of the Game. Scotland is one of only four countries to have a permanent representative on the IFAB; the other four representatives being appointed for set periods by FIFA.[406][407] The SFA has responsibility for the Scotland national football team and the Scotland women's team.  With the modern game of golf originating in 15th-century Scotland, the country is promoted as the home of golf.[408][409][410] To many golfers the Old Course in the Fife town of St Andrews, an ancient links course dating to before 1552,[411] is considered a site of pilgrimage.[412] In 1764, the standard 18-hole golf course was created at St Andrews when members modified the course from 22 to 18 holes.[413] The world's oldest golf tournament, and golf's first major, is The Open Championship, which was first played on 17 October 1860 at Prestwick Golf Club, in Ayrshire, Scotland, with Scottish golfers winning the earliest majors.[414] There are many other famous golf courses in Scotland, including Carnoustie, Gleneagles, Muirfield, and Royal Troon.  The Scottish Rugby Union is the second oldest rugby union in the world. Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh is the national stadium of the Scottish national rugby team. The Scotland rugby team played their first official test match, winning 1\u20130 against England at Raeburn Place in 1871. Scotland has competed in the Six Nations from the inaugural tournament in 1883, winning it 14 times outright\u2014including the last Five Nations in 1999\u2014and sharing it another 8. The Rugby World Cup was introduced in 1987 and Scotland have competed in all nine competitions, the most recent being in the 2023 Rugby World Cup. Scotland competes with the England rugby team annually for the Calcutta Cup. Each year, this fixture is played out as part of the Six Nations, with Scotland having last won in 2023.[415]  Other distinctive features of the national sporting culture include the Highland games, curling and shinty. In boxing, Scotland has had 13 world champions, including Ken Buchanan, Benny Lynch and Jim Watt. Scotland has also been successful in motorsport, particularly in Formula One. Notable drivers include; David Coulthard, Jim Clark, Paul Di Resta, and Jackie Stewart.[416] In IndyCar, Dario Franchitti has won 4 consecutive IndyCar world championships.[417]  Scotland has competed at every Commonwealth Games since 1930 and has won 356 medals in total\u201491 Gold, 104 Silver and 161 Bronze.[418] Edinburgh played host to the Commonwealth Games in 1970 and 1986, and most recently Glasgow in 2014.[419]  57\u00b0N 4\u00b0W\ufeff \/ \ufeff57\u00b0N 4\u00b0W\ufeff \/ 57; -4 "},{"title":"Canadian Football League","content":"  The Canadian Football League (CFL; French: Ligue canadienne de football\u2014LCF) is a professional sports league in Canada. The CFL is the highest level of competition in Canadian football. The league consists of nine teams, each located in a city in Canada. They are divided into two divisions: four teams in the East Division and five teams in the West Division. As of 2024[update], it features a 21-week regular season in which each team plays 18 games with three bye weeks. This season traditionally runs from mid-June to early November. Following the regular season, six teams compete in the league's three-week playoffs, which culminate in the Grey Cup championship game in late November. The Grey Cup is one of Canada's largest annual sports and television events.[3] The CFL was officially named on January 19, 1958,[4] upon the merger between the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union or \"Big Four\" (founded in 1907) and the Western Interprovincial Football Union (founded in March 1936).[5]  Rugby football began to be played in Canada in the 1860s, and many of the first Canadian football teams played under the auspices of the Canadian Rugby Football Union (CRFU), founded in June 1880 then reorganized in February 1884.[6] The CRFU was reorganized as the Canadian Rugby Union (CRU) in 1891, and served as an umbrella organization for several provincial and regional unions. The Grey Cup was donated by Governor General the Earl Grey in 1909 to the team winning the \"Senior Amateur Football Championship of Canada\". By that time, the sport as played in Canada had diverged markedly from its rugby origins with the introduction of the Burnside rules, and started to become more similar to the American game.  For much of the early part of the 20th century, the game was contested by intraprovincial leagues, or unions. In 1907, several of the stronger senior clubs in Ontario and Quebec formed the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (IRFU or more commonly known as the \u201cBig Four\u201d). It took almost 30 years for an elite interprovincial western union to emerge, when in 1936 the stronger senior clubs in Manitoba, Alberta and Saskatchewan formed the Western Interprovincial Football Union (WIFU). From the 1930s to the 1950s, the Big Four and WIFU gradually evolved from amateur to professional leagues, and amateur teams were no longer competitive for the Grey Cup. Apart from the World War II years, an amateur team last won the Grey Cup in 1936.  By the end of World War II, the WIFU's play was at the same level as that of the Big Four. Within a few years after the return of peace, both interprovincial unions had turned openly professional. However, while the Big Four champion got an automatic berth to the Grey Cup final, until 1954 the WIFU's champion had to play in a semi-final against the champion of the Ontario Rugby Football Union (ORFU)\u2013by then, the only amateur union still competing for the Grey Cup. The ORFU withdrew from Grey Cup competition after the 1953 season, and the WIFU champion was given an automatic berth in the Grey Cup final. For this reason, 1954 is reckoned as the start of the modern era of Canadian football, in which the Grey Cup has been exclusively contested by professional teams. Since 1965, Canada's top university football teams, competing in what is now U Sports, have competed for the Vanier Cup.  In 1956, the Montreal Alouettes threatened to leave the Big Four and join the rival WIFU.  As a result, the Big Four and WIFU formed a new umbrella organization, the Canadian Football Council (CFC) to modernize the operations and management of the professional game.  In 1958, the CFC formally left the CRU and reorganized as the Canadian Football League. As part of an agreement between the CRU and CFL, the CFL took possession of the Grey Cup, and the amateurs were officially locked out of Grey Cup play. However, the Grey Cup had been the de facto professional championship since 1954. The CRU remained the governing body for amateur play in Canada, eventually adopting the name Football Canada. Initially, the two unions remained autonomous, and there was no intersectional play between eastern (Big Four) and western (WIFU) teams except at the Grey Cup final. This situation was roughly analogous to how Major League Baseball operated for almost all of the 20th century.  The Big Four was renamed the Eastern Football Conference in 1960, while the WIFU was renamed the Western Football Conference in 1961. Also in 1961, limited intersectional play was introduced. Because the West played 16 games by this time while the East still only played 14, this arrangement oddly allowed both the four-team Eastern Conference and the five-team Western Conference to play three games per intraconference opponent and one game per interconference opponent. It was not until 1974 that the East expanded its schedule to 16 games, just like the West. In 1981, the two conferences agreed to a full merger, becoming the East and West Divisions of the CFL. With the merger came a fully balanced and interlocking schedule of 16 games per season (with all nine teams playing each other twice, once at home and once on the road). Since 1986 (with exception of 2021), the CFL's regular season schedule has been 18 games.  The separate histories of the Big Four and the WIFU accounted for the fact that two teams had basically the same name: the Big Four's Ottawa Rough Riders were often called the \"Eastern Riders\", while the WIFU's Saskatchewan Roughriders were called the \"Western Riders\" or \"Green Riders\". Other team names had traditional origins. With rowing a national craze in the late 19th century, the Argonaut Rowing Club of Toronto formed a rugby team for its members' off-season participation. The football team name Toronto Argonauts still remains even though it and the rowing club have long since gone their separate ways. After World War II, the two teams in Hamilton\u2014the Tigers and the Flying Wildcats\u2014merged both their organizations into the Hamilton Tiger-Cats.  The league remained stable with nine franchises\u2014the BC Lions, Calgary Stampeders, Edmonton Eskimos, Saskatchewan Roughriders, Winnipeg Blue Bombers, Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Toronto Argonauts, Ottawa Rough Riders and Montreal Alouettes\u2014from its 1958 inception until 1981. After the 1981 season, the Alouettes folded and were replaced the next year by a new franchise named the Concordes.  In 1986 the Concordes were renamed the Alouettes to attract more fan support, but the team folded the next year. The loss of the Montreal franchise forced the league to move its easternmost Western team, Winnipeg, into the East Division from 1987 to 1994.  In 1993, the league admitted its first United States-based franchise, the Sacramento Gold Miners. After modest success, the league then expanded further in the U.S. in 1994 with the Las Vegas Posse, Baltimore Stallions, and Shreveport Pirates. For the 1995 campaign, the American teams were split off into their own South Division, and two more teams, the Birmingham Barracudas and Memphis Mad Dogs, were added; at the same time, the Posse folded and the Gold Miners relocated to become the San Antonio Texans. In 1995, the Stallions became the only non-Canadian team to win the Grey Cup.  Despite all American teams having the advantage of not being bound to the CFL's minimum Canadian player quotas, only the Stallions proved to be an on-field and off-field success. The establishment of the NFL's Baltimore Ravens, worsening financial problems among the league's core Canadian teams, and the inconsistent performance of the other American teams prompted the CFL to abandon its American experiment and retrench its Canadian operations. The Stallions organization was used as the basis for a revival of the Montreal Alouettes.  The CFL returned to an all-Canadian format in 1996 with nine teams;[7] the league conducted a dispersal draft to distribute players from the disbanded American-based teams; however, the Ottawa Rough Riders, in existence since 1876, folded after the 1996 season (another dispersal draft was conducted the next year to distribute the former Rough Rider players among the remaining eight teams). Toronto and recently revived Montreal also were struggling; Montreal's woes were solved by moving to Percival Molson Memorial Stadium, a much smaller venue than the cavernous Olympic Stadium. The Winnipeg team again moved to the East Division from 1997 to 2001 to make up for the loss of Ottawa.  In 1997, the NFL provided a US$3-million interest-free loan to the financially struggling CFL. In return, the NFL was granted access to CFL players entering a defined two-month window in the option year of their contract. This was later written into the CFL's collective bargaining agreement with its players. The CFL's finances have since stabilized and they eventually repaid the loan. The CFL\u2013NFL agreement expired in 2006. Both leagues have been attempting to reach a new agreement, but the CFL broke off negotiations in November 2007 after Canadian telecommunications firm Rogers Communications paid $78\u00a0million to host seven Bills games in Toronto over five seasons (the last Bills Toronto Series game was played during the 2013 NFL season).[8][9]  In 2002, the league expanded back to nine teams with the creation of the Ottawa Renegades. After four seasons of financial losses, the Renegades were suspended indefinitely before the 2006 season; their players were absorbed by the remaining teams in a dispersal draft. Winnipeg was moved to the East Division again in 2006, a situation that continued until 2013.  In 2005, the league set an all-time attendance record with a total attendance of more than 2.3\u00a0million.[10] In June 2006 the league announced the launch of CFL Broadband, an internet streaming service designed to provide fans with another media platform, in addition to TSN and CBC broadcasts, to watch games live.[11]  With Mark Cohon as commissioner of the league the CFL entered a period of stability and growth. New television deals, two new collective bargaining agreements, the 100th Grey Cup celebration, and widespread stadium renovation and rebuilding highlighted this era. The 100th anniversary of the Grey Cup had the highest ever television ratings for a championship game in English Canada.[12]  During the 2000s the CFL had the third highest per-game attendance of any North American sports league and the seventh highest per-game attendance of any sports league worldwide. A 2006 survey conducted at the University of Lethbridge confirmed that the CFL was the second most popular sports league in Canada, with the following of 19% of the total adult Canadian population compared to 30% for the NHL. The NFL had 11% following, with a total of 26% following at least one of the pro football leagues. In other words, approximately 80% of Canadian football fans follow the CFL, and about 55% follow the NFL.[13] With the absence of Ottawa from 2006 to 2013, league attendance hovered around the 2\u00a0million mark. It stood at 2,029,875 in 2012 for a single game average of 28,193.[14] The 2007 season was a recent high point with average game attendance of 29,167, the best since 1983.[15]  During Mark Cohon's time in office many of the teams either undertook major renovations to their existing stadiums, or constructed brand new stadiums. The Montreal Alouettes were the first to undertake this project, adding 5,000 seats to Percival Molson Memorial Stadium in time for the 2010 CFL season.[16] The Edmonton Eskimos and Calgary Stampeders also renovated their respective stadiums and facilities for the 2010 season.[17] In 2011, the BC Lions played under a new, retractable roof in BC Place after spending one and a half seasons at Empire Field.[18] In 2013, the Winnipeg Blue Bombers moved to Investors Group Field, now known as Princess Auto Stadium, an entirely new stadium at the University of Manitoba. The Hamilton Tiger-Cats began using their new stadium, Tim Hortons Field, after spending 2013 at University of Guelph's stadium and the first half of the 2014 season at McMaster University's football field following the demolition of the iconic Ivor Wynne Stadium.[19]  In 2014 the Ottawa Redblacks kicked off their inaugural season (having been awarded a franchise in 2008[20]), becoming the third Ottawa franchise in CFL history. The new Ottawa franchise returned the league to a nine-team structure, with five teams in the West Division and four in the East; the Winnipeg Blue Bombers moved back to the West Division.[21]  The expansion Ottawa Redblacks played at the massively renovated Frank Clair Stadium, now branded as TD Place Stadium.[22]  In Mark Cohon's last year as commissioner he negotiated a new five-year collective bargaining agreement (from 2014 through the 2018 season) between the CFL and the Canadian Football League Players' Association (CFLPA).[23]  The Toronto Argonauts entered a period of transition off the field, with new ownership and a new stadium. The Argonauts were sold by politician\/businessman David Braley to Bell Media and MLSE chairman Larry Tanenbaum.[24] At the start of the 2016 season the Argos moved to BMO Field after more than twenty seasons at the Rogers Centre (formerly called the SkyDome from 1989 to 2005).[25] Construction on the New Mosaic Stadium for the Saskatchewan Roughriders was completed in October 2016[26] and the first game was played in the 2017 season.[27]  In 2015, Michael Sam signed a two-year contract with Montreal Alouettes of the CFL,[28][29] becoming the first openly gay player in the league's history.[29] Sam left the team the day before the first preseason game, citing personal reasons.[30]  As reported by Fox Sports, Sam returned to Montreal to continue his professional football career.[31] He left again on August 14, this time permanently, again citing personal reasons.  Immediately following the 2015 season Jeffrey Orridge announced a re-branding for the CFL, including a new logo, motto, uniforms for all nine teams and website.[32] After not having a drug enforcement policy in effect for the 2015 season the league and the CFLPA agreed to a new drug policy.[33] In 2017, the Board of Governors and Jeffrey Orridge agreed to part ways, effective June 30, 2017; Orridge cited \"differing views on the future of the league\" between him and the Board of Governors for the departure, with both sides stating the decision was mutual and amicable.[34] His last day as commissioner was June 15, 2017.[35] Jim Lawson, the CFL's Chair of the Board of Governors, took over the duties of interim Commissioner until a suitable replacement was found.[36]  On July 5, 2017, Randy Ambrosie succeeded Orridge as CFL commissioner.[37][38] Having spent nine seasons as a player with the Calgary Stampeders, Toronto Argonauts and Edmonton Eskimos from 1985 to 1993, Ambrosie is the first commissioner to have played in the league since Larry Smith left the position in 1997.  On September 12, 2018, it was announced that Buffalo, New York-based New Era Cap Company would become the official apparel supplier of the CFL beginning in 2019, replacing Adidas.[39]  In October 2018, the CFL began focusing marketing internationally again after the unsuccessful expansion into the United States during the 1990s, with Ambrosie's plan being called CFL 2.0.[40] Ambrosie partnered with the Professional American Football League of Mexico (LFA) for player development, as part of the league's plan to expand globally.[41][42][43] Ambrosie also later announced a special edition of the CFL Combine to be held in 2019 in Mexico for Mexican players, which was held on January 13, 2019.[44] Ambroise said he wished the combine in Mexico to become annual, and that a combine could be held in Europe.[44] On January 14, 2019, the league held a draft of LFA and Mexican university players[45] where wide receiver Diego Viamontes was the first pick, selected by the Edmonton Eskimos.[46] The CFL announced in February 2019 that German and French football players from the German Football League and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration fran\u00e7aise de football am\u00e9ricain\u00a0[fr] would participate in the CFL national combine.[47][48] Throughout early 2019, Ambrosie actively travelled Europe forming partnerships between the CFL and top-level European American football leagues and associations, specifically Germany (GFL), Austria (AFL), France (FFFA), the Nordic countries (NL, VL, SS, and NAFL), and Italy (IFL).[49][50][51] By January 2020 football leagues from 13 countries had signed partnerships with the CFL,[52] these partnerships included mutual exchanging of players and coaches[53] with leagues like the Mexican LFA holding reserved roster spots for Canadians with up to 25 playing in the league's 2020 season.[54] In February 2020, the CFL expanded its global alliance system, welcoming the Japanese X-League, generally regarded the third-best professional gridiron league in the world.[55] This coincided with the CFL announcing that its global combine in 2020 with new rules, including two designated active-roster international players and three practice-squad international players with as many as 45 global players in the league.[56]  The league took over operations of the Montreal Alouettes prior to the 2019 season after Robert C. Wetenhall, the league's last non-Canadian owner, surrendered the franchise to the league in May.[57] The Alouettes found new ownership in January 2020 in Crawford Steel executives Sid Spiegel and Gary Stern, whose holding company S and S Sportsco would oversee the team.[58]  On August 17, 2020, the CFL cancelled its 2020 season after coronavirus-related social distancing mandates and travel restrictions imposed in most of Canada prevented the league from selling tickets and the league was unable to secure a bailout from the federal government to cover any losses. It was the first cancelled season in the league's history, and the first year without a Grey Cup championship since the canceled 1916\u20131919 seasons. The league returned in 2021, playing a shortened 14-game schedule which began that August, with the season concluding with the Grey Cup game in December for the first time since 1972.[59][60] On March 10, 2021, the then-on hiatus XFL entered into talks with the CFL over the possibility of a future collaboration;[61] these discussions were called off four months later with nothing coming of them.[62]  On August 29, 2022, Gary Stern of the Montreal Alouettes stepped away from day-to-day operations with the club and resigned from his role with the Canadian Football League's board of governors, effective immediately.[63] On February 14, 2023, the ownership of the Alouettes was transferred back to the CFL.[64] Mario Cecchini was appointed as the interim President while the league sought to finalize a sale to new ownership.[65] On March 10, Quebec media mogul and former Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leader Pierre Karl P\u00e9ladeau purchased the team.[66]  Notes  Note: team franchise history is listed as it is recognized by the CFL in its publication CFL Guide and Record Book (2017).[83]  Potential CFL expansion markets are the Maritimes, Quebec City, Saskatoon, London, and Windsor, all of which have been lobbying for Canadian Football League franchises in recent years.[84][85][86] During the 1970s and 1980s, Harold Ballard attempted multiple times (albeit all unsuccessfully) to secure a second CFL team for Toronto (either by way of expansion or by relocating the Hamilton Tiger-Cats), under the premise that Canada's largest city could support two teams.[87]  Since the 1980s, the CFL has occasionally played exhibition and, later, regular-season games at various cities in the Maritimes, including Canada Games Stadium in Saint John, New Brunswick; Huskies Stadium in Halifax, Nova Scotia; and Moncton Stadium in Moncton, New Brunswick. The league conditionally approved an expansion franchise, the Atlantic Schooners, for play in the 1984 season, but the team never made it to play after plans for a stadium collapsed.  No city in the Maritimes has a permanent stadium that meets CFL standards. As of 2010, the largest stadium in the Maritimes is Croix-Bleue Medavie Stadium, which has 8,300 permanent seats and is expandable to 20,000 with temporary seats.[88][89] A pre-season game, dubbed Touchdown Atlantic, was held in Halifax in the 2005 CFL season and regular season games were played in Moncton under the same branding in 2010, 2011, and 2013.[90] All 20,000 seats for the 2010 Moncton game sold out in 32 hours;[91] the 2013 game did not sell out. Former Commissioner Mark Cohon said that Moncton Stadium would require massive renovations to host a CFL team permanently. The cost of the required renovations would be the equivalent of building a brand-new stadium.[92] In November 2015 the Halifax city council voted 9\u20137 against purchasing land that would then be used to build a 20,000-seat stadium. It was agreed that the price tag for the land was too much, but the close vote indicated municipal interest in building a near CFL sized stadium in Halifax.[93]  In November 2017, the CFL conducted further discussions with a group in Halifax interested in securing a franchise for the city;[94] the group made a \"very credible\" pitch to the CFL head office.[95] According to TSN analyst Dave Naylor the group named 'Maritime Football Ltd.' consists of Anthony LeBlanc (former president and CEO of the NHL's Arizona Coyotes), Bruce Bowser (president of AMJ Campbell Van Lines) and Gary Drummond (former president of hockey operations for the Coyotes).[95] In June 2018 the group met with the Halifax Regional Council in private about plans to bring a CFL team to Halifax, with the possibility of playing at Universit\u00e9 de Moncton while a stadium in Halifax is being built.[96][97] Maritime Football Ltd. ownership group selected a site in Shannon Park, Dartmouth, Nova Scotia to develop a new stadium.[98] The stadium was estimated to cost between $170 to $190\u00a0million, seat 24,000 and have a business model similar to the Ottawa Redblacks, who entered the league in 2014.[99] On October 30, 2018, Halifax City Council unanimously voted in favour of proceeding with a business case analysis of a stadium in the Halifax municipality.[100][101] Following this positive momentum, Maritime Football Ltd. and CFL commissioner Randy Ambrosie announced that the group would proceed with a season ticket drive to further gauge interest, and also running a team name contest in the hopes of making an announcement on the team name just prior to the 106th Grey Cup game.[102] The target year for the proposed team to enter the league was 2021, with the team name including \"Atlantic\" in its name, but no franchise was actually awarded in this announcement.[103][104] Further to the previous discussions with Moncton and New Brunswick politicians, it was also suggested that the potential new franchise could begin play in Moncton while the stadium in Halifax is built.[104] On November 23, 2018, two days before the 106th Grey Cup, Maritime Football Ltd., since renamed Schooners Sports and Entertainment, and commissioner Ambrosie announced the new team would be called the Atlantic Schooners.[105] On March 15, 2023, TSN reporter Dave Naylor revealed that Schooner Sports and Entertainment (SSE) \"is no longer involved in pursuing a team for Atlantic Canada\".[82]  There has been interest in adding a team in Quebec City. In 2003, an exhibition game was held at Telus Stadium between the Montreal Alouettes and Ottawa Renegades where Montreal won 54\u201323.[106] In 2008, the federal government rejected a proposal that could have paved the way for a CFL franchise in Quebec City, saying Ottawa is not in the business of subsidizing professional sports.[107] The following year in May 2009, Christina Saint Marche, a British businesswoman, announced her interest in operating a team in Quebec City\u2014stating that there would be a natural rivalry with the Montreal Alouettes.[108]  During the 2010 Grey Cup state of the league news conference, Cohon noted that the Alouettes hold the rights for the entire province of Quebec and that any expansion would have to be negotiated with them first.[109]  Another exhibition game was held at Telus Stadium on June 13, 2015, with Ottawa (whose TD Place Stadium was in use by the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup) hosting Montreal.[110]  Saskatoon last hosted top-level Canadian football in 1935 when the Regina Roughriders left the Saskatchewan Rugby Football Union to form the WIFU. The Saskatoon Hilltops (along with another Saskatchewan-based team, the Moose Jaw Millers) eventually suspended operations due to World War II; the Hilltops remained an amateur team when they returned in 1947 (they have since played in the Canadian Junior Football League). Saskatoon last won a provincial title in 1921. By the time they resumed play after the war, the Roughriders had been the dominant team in the province for two decades.  In early 2012, management at Credit Union Centre publicly expressed its desire to bring a CFL team to Saskatoon. However, the Regina-based Saskatchewan Roughriders have long branded themselves as a province-wide team, and claimed that the population of Saskatchewan is too small to support two teams.[84]  In any event, Saskatoon also lacks a suitable outdoor stadium. Its largest, Griffiths Stadium, home of the University of Saskatchewan's Saskatchewan Huskies, seats only 6,171 spectators. The Gordie Howe Bowl, which has hosted CFL exhibitions in the past, has even fewer seats (it seats 3,950 people).  While not openly being considered for franchise expansion, Mexico was suggested by Commissioner Randy Ambrosie as a possible location for neutral site regular season games (similar to the NFL's Mexico Series) as early as 2019, as well as potentially partnering with the LFA for player development, as part of the league's plan to expand globally.[41][42][43] Ambrosie also later announced a special edition of the CFL Combine to be held in 2019 in Mexico for Mexican players, and in 2019, the league held a draft of LFA and Mexican university players. In March 2019, Commissioner Randy Ambrosie told the media that after the LFA combine, multiple parties inquired about purchasing a franchise for Mexico. Ambrosie reiterated that the league had no intention to expand internationally at this time.[45]  Since 2018, the CFL season has included:  Team training camps open 28 days prior to the first regular season game of the season, a camp solely devoted to first year players is allowed the 3 days before the main camp opens. The pre-season exhibition schedule is two weeks long with each team playing two games against teams from its own division.  The regular season is 21 weeks long, with games beginning in mid-June and finishing by early November. With 18 regular season games being played, each team gets three bye weeks. The CFL's nine current teams are divided into two divisions: the East Division with four teams and the West Division, with five teams.  From the 1986 season until the COVID-19 pandemic (other than during the U.S. expansion when the league had twelve and thirteen teams) each team played two games against each of the other eight teams, plus two or four additional divisional games with opponents rotating each season. The CFL is returning to this format beginning in the 2024 season.[111]  This format was changed when the league resumed play in 2021 to create a greater emphasis on divisional play. Under the current eighteen game format, each Eastern team now plays ten games within their division and eight games against Western opponents, thus playing two of the Western teams once (one at home and one on the road) and the other three Western teams twice, while playing two Eastern opponents three times and one division rival four times. Three of the Western teams play each division rival three times, two Eastern teams twice and two Eastern teams once. The remaining two Western teams play three of the Eastern opponents twice and one of the Eastern opponents once, while playing each other twice and the other Western teams three times.  The most popular featured week in the CFL season is the Labour Day Classic, played over the course of the Labour Day weekend, where the matchups feature the first half of home-and-home series between the traditional geographic rivalries of Toronto\u2013Hamilton (a rivalry which began in 1873[6]), Edmonton\u2013Calgary (see Battle of Alberta), Winnipeg\u2013Saskatchewan, and Ottawa\u2013Montreal. In years that Ottawa or Montreal were not in the league, BC played against one of these teams.[112] The following week's rematch of these games is a popular event as well, especially in recent years, where the rematch of the Saskatchewan\u2013Winnipeg game has been dubbed the Banjo Bowl.  Other features of the regular season schedule are the Hall of Fame Game and the Thanksgiving Day Classic, the doubleheader held on Thanksgiving where the match ups usually do not feature traditional rivalries. From 2010 to 2013, a neutral site regular season game was played in Moncton under the name Touchdown Atlantic.  The league awards points based on regular season results (much like in most ice hockey leagues, but unlike the NFL, which strictly uses winning percentages to determine their standings; two points are awarded for a win, one for a tie and none for a loss). As of the 2021 season, in the event two or more teams in a division finish the season with the same number of points, the tie is broken based on the following criteria (in descending order), with coin tosses used if all such tie-breaker steps fail:[113]  The playoffs take place in November. After the regular season, the top team from each division has an automatic home berth in the division final, and a bye week during the division semifinal. The second-place team from each division hosts the third-place team in the division semifinal, unless a fourth-place team from one division finishes with a better record than a third place team in the other (this provision is known as the crossover rule, and while it implies that it is possible for two teams in the same division to play for the Grey Cup, only three crossover teams have won a semifinal since the rule's 1996 inception, and neither advanced to the Grey Cup). The winners of each division's semifinal game then travel to play the first place teams in the division finals. Since 2005, the division semifinals and division finals have been sponsored by Scotiabank.[114] The two division champions then face each other in the Grey Cup game, which, since 2007, has been held either on the fourth or fifth Sunday of November; for 2021, the game was played in December, the first time this had happened since 1972.  The Grey Cup is both the name of the championship of the CFL and the name of the trophy awarded to the victorious team. The Grey Cup is the second-oldest trophy in North American professional sports, after the Stanley Cup. The Grey Cup game is hosted in one of the league's member cities. In recent years, it has been hosted in a different city every year, selected two or more years in advance. The Toronto Argonauts have won the most Grey Cups with 18 wins total, most recently in 2022. In 2012, the game was held in Toronto at Rogers Centre, and for the second year in row the cup was won on a team's home field, with Toronto beating Calgary 35\u201322.[115] In 2013, the Grey Cup was won at home for the third consecutive time (by the Saskatchewan Roughriders), which had not been done since Toronto won at home from 1945 to 1947. In 2016, the Grey Cup was won on the natural grass turf of BMO Field by the Ottawa Redblacks beating the heavily favoured Calgary Stampeders 39\u201333 in overtime; the first Grey Cup championship for any Ottawa CFL team in 40 years.  As the country's single largest annual sporting event,[3] the Grey Cup has long served as an unofficial Canadian autumn festival generating national media coverage and a large amount of revenue for the host city. Many fans travel from across the country to attend the game and the week of festivities that lead up to it. A 2014 survey found that 48% of Canadians would prefer to watch the Grey Cup over the Super Bowl if they could only watch one or the other, with 52% preferring the Super Bowl.[116]  Since 2015, the Grey Cup game's presenting sponsor is Shaw Communications.[118]  Following the Grey Cup game, the Grey Cup Most Valuable Player and Grey Cup Most Valuable Canadian are selected. A number of league individual player awards, such as the Most Outstanding Player and Most Outstanding Defensive Player, are awarded annually at a special ceremony in the host city during the week before the Grey Cup game; this ceremony is broadcast nationally on TSN. The Annis Stukus Trophy, also known as the Coach of the Year Award, is awarded separately at a banquet held during the off-season each February. While the CFL has not held an all-star game since 1988, an All-Star Team is selected and honoured at the league awards ceremony during Grey Cup week.  The CFL Championship game, the Grey Cup, previously held the record for the largest television audience in Canadian history. Television coverage on CBC, CTV and Radio-Canada of the 1983 Grey Cup attracted a viewing audience of 8,118,000 people[citation needed] as Toronto edged B.C. 18\u201317, ending a 31-year championship drought for the Argonauts. At the time, this represented 33% of the Canadian population.[citation needed] This has since been surpassed by the 2002 and 2010 Men's Olympic Gold Medal Hockey Game.[citation needed]  Currently, the official television broadcasters of CFL games are cable network TSN (which began televising CFL games in 1985), while TSN's French-language network RDS broadcasts Montreal Alouettes games for the Quebec television market.[119] Games are typically scheduled for Thursday to Saturday evenings during June, July and August, but switch to more Saturday and Sunday afternoon games during September and October.[120] TSN has created a tradition of at least one Friday night game each week, branded as Friday Night Football. CBC and TSN drew record television audiences for CFL broadcasts in 2005.[121] The 2006 season was the first season in which every regular-season game was televised, as the league implemented an instant replay challenge system.[122] In 2006, the CFL also began offering pay-per-view webcasts of every game on CFL Broadband.[123] Until the end of the 2007 season, CBC and RDS were the exclusive television broadcasters for all playoff games, including the Grey Cup, which regularly draws a Canadian viewing audience in excess of 4\u00a0million.[124]  In 2008, the CFL began a new, five-year television deal with CTVglobemedia. Valued at $16\u00a0million per-year, it gave TSN and RDS exclusive rights to all CFL games, including the playoffs and Grey Cup.[3] In March 2013, TSN exercised an option to extend its contract through 2018. In 2015, the deal was extended for an additional three years, along with exclusive Grey Cup rights for Bell Media Radio stations.[125]  In 2013, the CFL announced that its U.S. broadcast rights would return to the ESPN Networks for the 2013 season, with five games airing on ESPN2, and 55 airing on ESPN3.[126] This agreement was renewed in 2014 for five years, the same length as the TSN deal (ESPN holds a stake in TSN), with a stipulation that at least 17 games would be carried on ESPN2 (or another ESPN network, such as ESPN or ESPNEWS) each season, including the Grey Cup; this gives ESPN exclusive CFL rights during this time frame. Originally ESPN3 carried all games not carried on one of the linear channels online, later ESPN moved those games to ESPN+.[127][128][129][130]  ESPN has had a long relationship with the CFL; the channel broadcast its first CFL game on July 9, 1980, when the network was only 10 months old.[131]  On April 27, 2023, CBS Sports Network announced a multi-year broadcasting rights deal with the league, becoming the U.S. TV rightsholder to the league; the channel broadcast 34 CFL games for the 2023 season.[132]  ESPN Brasil began broadcasting CFL games live in Brazil in 2015, as a result of the growth of the NFL and College Football fan base in Brazil.[133] BT Sport, which has a licensing partnership with ESPN, has also carried CFL games in Britain and Ireland since 2015.[134]  In June 2019, the CFL signed a broadcast deal with MVS Comunicaciones to broadcast one game a week in Mexico on MVS TV.[135]  The public broadcaster CBC Television, which held a monopoly on Canadian television until 1961, held Canadian professional football broadcast rights beginning the year of its debut, 1952. The private, commercial CTV network was created in 1961 in part because Toronto businessman John Bassett had won the television rights to the Eastern Football Conference, and needed an outlet to air the games. From 1962 through 1986, CBC and CTV shared CFL broadcasting rights. They split playoff games and simulcast the Grey Cup. In 1962, 1965, 1967, 1968 and 1970, CTV commentators were used for the dual network telecast, while in 1963, 1964, 1966 and 1969, the CBC's announcers were provided. From 1971 through 1986, one network's crew called the first half while the other called the other half. After the 1986 season, CTV dropped coverage of the CFL and the Grey Cup. From 1987 through 1990, the CFL operated its own syndicated network, CFN. Like CTV, CFN split playoff games with CBC. However, CFN had completely separate coverage of the Grey Cup, utilizing its own production and commentators. From 1991 to 2007, all post-season games had been exclusively on CBC; beginning in 2008, the Grey Cup and all other CFL games are exclusive to cable TV on TSN, although the cable provider reserves the right to move the game to sister network CTV (as of 2022, it has never done so, opting to broadcast that Sunday's NFL games on CTV instead.)  The predecessor to the CFL's East Division, the IRFU, had a television contract with NBC in 1954 that provided far more coverage than the NFL's existing contract with DuMont. NBC aired games on Saturday afternoons, competing against college football broadcasts on CBS and ABC. The revenue from the contract allowed the IRFU to directly compete against the NFL for players in the late 1950s, setting up a series of CFL games in the United States beginning in 1958 and a series of interleague exhibitions beginning in 1959. Interest in the CFL in the United States faded dramatically after the debut of the American Football League in 1960.[136]  In 1982, during a players' strike in the NFL, NBC broadcast CFL games in the United States in lieu of the NFL games which were cancelled; the first week of broadcasts featured the NFL on NBC broadcast teams, before a series of blowout games on the network and the resulting low ratings resulted in NBC cutting back and eventually cancelling its CFL coverage after only a few weeks. ESPN host Chris Berman became a fan of the game in the early days of ESPN, when the network first aired CFL games, and continues to cover the Canadian league on-air.[137] The now-defunct FNN-SCORE (unrelated to the Canadian cable network formerly known as The Score [now Sportsnet 360]) carried games in the late 1980s. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, SportsChannel America carried games, using CBC Television, CFN and TSN feeds. In 1993, several SportsChannel Pacific-produced games that were part of the Sacramento Gold Miners' local package were also shown nationally.  Beginning in 1994, with now four US-based teams in the league, ESPN reached a four-year deal with the league to produce and air two games per week and all post-season games on its fledgling ESPN2. They also put some games on the main network to fill broadcast time vacated by the 1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike. The 1994 and 1995 Grey Cups were shown live on ESPN2 and then re-aired on ESPN the following day, leading into the network's Monday Night Countdown show. ESPN's on-air talent included a mix of the network's American football broadcasters and established CFL broadcasters from Canada. Most of the US-based teams also had deals with local carriers to show games that were not covered in the national package. Though there were no US teams in the league after 1995, ESPN2 continued showing games until 1997, albeit on a much lighter schedule.  The now-defunct America One network held CFL broadcast rights in the United States from 2001 to 2009 and aired a majority of the league's games.[138] Until the 2007 season, America One syndicated CFL games to regional sports networks like Altitude, NESN, and MASN; these were discontinued in 2008, mainly because America One and the CFL were able to reach a deal only days before the season began, not allowing the network time to establish agreements with individual RSNs. The Grey Cup aired on Versus on November 22, 2008, with a replay the next day on America One. From 2006 through the 2008 season, Friday Night Football was carried exclusively on World Sport HD in the United States; however, due to the January 2009 shutdown of that channel's parent company, Voom HD Networks, America One reclaimed those rights.  NFL Network took over the league broadcast contract in 2010. For the 2010 season, the network carried 14 games, no more than one each week.[139] For 2011, the network increased its output to two games each week.[140] NFL Network declined to continue its coverage after the 2011 season.[141] It offered to pick up another package in 2019 on the condition that the league change its schedule to not directly compete with the NFL regular season,[142] something that the CFL stated needs to be negotiated with the players' union.[143]  In late July 2012, NBC Sports Network acquired rights to the CFL for the remainder of the 2012 season. The NBCSN deal included nine regular season games starting August 27 (including Labour Day Classic games) and all the playoffs.[144] NBC Sports renewed their agreement with the CFL for the 2013 season.[145]  ESPN regained the U.S. CFL broadcast rights in 2014, airing games until 2022.[146][147]  The European ESPN America network carried a collection of CFL games as part of its lineup until the network shut down in 2013.  There are no blackout restrictions on radio broadcasts of CFL games, while TSN streams all games online for authenticated subscribers to participating television providers.  The majority of games not on ESPN television channels are streamed in the United States via the subscription service ESPN+.[148]  In 2017, the league announced a partnership with Yare Media to offer subscription streaming packages in 130 international territories.[149]  In 2023, the league announced the creation of CFL+, which made free, live streaming of every regular-season game available to all international viewers; and for those in the United States, to all games not being carried on CBS Sports Network.[150]  CFL teams have individual local broadcast contracts with terrestrial radio stations for regular season and playoff games, while TSN Radio owns the rights to the Grey Cup.[151] In 2006, Sirius Satellite Radio gained exclusive rights for North American CFL satellite radio broadcasts and broadcast 25 CFL games per season, including the Grey Cup, through 2008.[152] Sirius later extended its radio coverage through 2010,[153][154] after which it merged with former rival XM Radio Canada to form Sirius XM Canada. The merged broadcaster continues to air CFL games, and as of 2022[update], is contracted to air the CFL until the 2023 season.[needs update] English language broadcasts of every CFL game air on Canada Talks, with French-language broadcasts of the Montreal Alouettes broadcast on Influence Franco.[155]  According to the new collective bargaining agreement, the 2024 salary cap will at least $5,585,000 CAD (or $124,111 CAD per active roster spot). [156][157] This will be the first season that players will begin to receive revenue sharing, which will be set at 25% this season (or cap increase of 2.78% for every dollar increase). [156] The salary cap is officially announced in late April every year as well as fines from previous year.  As was the case in 2023, the minimum player salary will be set at $70,000 CAD.[156][157]  As of the 2024 season, CFL teams have a $2,500,000 CAD operations caps which limits the number of people per team drawing salaries for football operations to 11 coaches and 25 total people in total. That includes the general manager as well as scouts, video personnel, and equipment staff.[158]  The CFLPA agreed to include a provision allowing the CFL to enforce a salary cap in the 2002 Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA),[159] but the league began enforcing it only from the 2007 season ($4.05\u00a0million per team) onward. The cap was raised to $4.2\u00a0million in the 2008 season and remained at that level for 2009.[160] Financial penalties for teams that breach the cap are set at $1 to $1 for the first $100,000 over, $2 to $1 for $100,000 to $300,000 over, and $3 to $1 for $300,000 and above. Penalties could also include forfeited draft picks.[161] On June 29, 2010, a new collective bargaining agreement was ratified that raised the salary cap to $4.25\u00a0million for the 2010 CFL season and continued to increase by $50,000 each season until 2013.[162] In 2014, a new CBA was ratified and the salary cap was raised to $5\u00a0million per team, with that amount increasing again by $50,000 each year until 2018.[163] As per the 2019 collective bargaining agreement, the 2021 salary expenditure cap is scheduled to be $5,350,000 and with the minimum team salary set at $4,750,000.[164][165][166] The salary cap number was subject to increase as players now have revenue sharing of 20% from broadcast deals (outside of TSN and ESPN), but since the league did not play in 2020, the cap number will likely be static.[165][166]  For 2010, the minimum team salary was set at $3.9\u00a0million while the minimum player salary was set at $42,000.[162] With the new CBA in 2014, the salary floor was raised to $4.4\u00a0million per team with increases of $50,000 per year, and the minimum salary was raised to $50,000 per year.[163] The average salary per player in 2014 was CA$96,000.[167] A new collective bargaining agreement was signed in 2019 that set the minimum annual player salary at $54,000, with that number increasing to $65,000 for National and American players in 2020.[168] In 2019, Mike Reilly and Bo Levi Mitchell were the highest paid players in the CFL after signing contracts in February 2019 for average yearly salaries of over $700,000.[169] Players designated as global players (see player designations) are paid the league minimum by rule and may have a portion of their salary sent back to their original home league as part of a partnership with the CFL.[170]  Player compensation is not tied to league revenue, which remains a trade secret. Only the four publicly held teams in the league reveal their financial information, as those companies are required to do so under Canadian law. As of 2013, prior to Ottawa's rejoining the league (at which time Toronto, which is partially owned by a public company, was still fully private), estimates of the CFL's revenue varied between $150\u00a0million[171] and CA$200\u00a0million.[172] As of 2019, five of the CFL's nine teams (including all three community-owned franchises) are profitable, and four operate at a loss; those four teams lose more than the five profitable teams, resulting in a net loss of approximately CA$20\u00a0million overall.[173]  Players in the CFL carry nationality designations referring to their country of origin: Nationals (\"a Canadian citizen at the time of signing his first contract, was classified as a non-import prior to May 21, 2019, was physically resident in Canada for an aggregate period of five years prior to reaching the age of 18, or played football for a minimum of three years at a U Sports institution, was draft eligible in 2021 at a minimum, and has graduated with a degree at that institution\"), Americans (non-National and non-Global players, almost exclusively used for United States citizens), and Globals (any player who does not hold Canadian or American citizenship and does not qualify as a National in any other way).[174] In prior versions of the CFL CBA and league rules, National players were known as non-import players and American players were known as international (2014\u20132018) and import (before 2014) players, with the criteria to qualify as a non-import player being more restrictive.[175] Global players were introduced in 2019.[174]  National players enter the CFL through the CFL Draft or free agency. Global players enter the CFL in a similar method as national players, with exclusive drafts held only for eligible players. American players are typically inducted by way of the negotiation list: any team can lay unilateral claim to up to 45 players that have never played in the CFL at any given time (each team must make at least ten of those names public as of 2018), with no limit on how long a player can be held on the list and no limit on how old the player must be (thus CFL teams can claim players not yet eligible for the NFL Draft). Once a player on a negotiation list expresses formal interest in joining the CFL, that team has up to ten days to offer a contract (usually a league-minimum, two-year contract) to retain the player's rights.[176] Other than the names that are made public, the full list of names league-wide are a secret held from the general public and even from the other teams, with teams only finding out if a player is on another team's negotiating list if the league office tells them.  In 2006, the active roster limit was increased from 40 to 42, in 2014 it was again increased to 44, and in 2016 was increased to 46.[163][177][178] An unlimited number of players may be put on a team's disabled, injured and suspended lists.  As of 2021, each team must abide by the National\/American\/Global ratio rule, which requires teams to have two quarterbacks, two Global players, and a maximum of 20 American players (excluding quarterbacks) with a minimum of 44 total Active Roster players and a maximum of 45.[177][179] Each team will also have one player of any nationality on the Reserve Roster who receives the benefits of being on the Active Roster, but may not play in a game.[179]  Through the 2018 season, quarterbacks, of which a team was required to carry three on a roster, were not allowed to be counted toward the national player requirement nor the starter requirement, which put Canadian quarterbacks at a disadvantage compared to other positions in being hired by a CFL franchise.[177][180] This rule was changed in 2019 whereby teams had two roster spots for quarterbacks and a third quarterback counted in the ratio.[181][182][183] Additionally, a National quarterback would be considered one of the club's National Starting Players as long as he remains on the field at the quarterback position.[184]  Teams are additionally allowed up to 10 national or international players (with a minimum of one national if there are less than seven players or two nationals if there are at least seven players total) on their practice squad roster and may expand it to 12 if the team carries the maximum allowed two global practice squad players, though they are not required to do so.[161][177][178] Every year, the practice squad roster is temporarily increased in size to 15 following the start of the National Football League's season to accommodate for the influx of cut NFL players.[178] Unlike players on the active roster, players on the practice squad may be signed at any time to another team's active roster without compensation to the player's original team.[178]  CFL players are represented by the Canadian Football League Players' Association (CFLPA). Each team elects two players to the CFLPA Board of Player Representatives, which meets once per year. Every two years, it elects an executive Board of Directors.[185]  Eligible Canadian nationals (usually from U Sports football domestically or American college football) are drafted by teams in the annual CFL Draft. The draft usually takes place in May and currently consists of eight rounds. The first two rounds of the draft are usually shown live on TSN. The CFL Combine (formerly known as the CFL Evaluation Camp), similar to the NFL Combine,[186] precedes the draft. A junior player in the locale of a team may be claimed as a territorial exemption and sign with that team before beginning collegiate play (one recent example is when the BC Lions claimed Andrew Harris[187]). Teams maintain \"negotiation lists\" of players they wish to sign as free agents, which give them exclusive negotiation rights with that player if they wish to sign in the CFL. Players can be added or removed from these lists by the team at any time, and their signing rights can be used in trades. "},{"title":"Rugby Canada","content":"Rugby Canada is the national governing body for the sport of rugby union in Canada.  Rugby Canada was incorporated in 1974, and stems from the Canadian Rugby Football Union, a body established in 1884 that now governs amateur Canadian football as Football Canada; and the now-defunct Rugby Union of Canada, established in 1929.  Rugby Canada administers the Canada national rugby union team and sanctions the Rugby Canada National Junior Championship, a national competition for under-20 men's teams. It previously sanctioned the Super League as the premier level of men's competition in the country, but scrapped that league after the Americas Rugby Championship was created in 2009 as a two-stage competition in which the first involved only Canadian teams.  The Canadian Rugby Football Union was established in 1884 with the specific purpose of organizing play-off games between various union champions. Representatives from the Montreal Football club (now known as the Westmount Rugby Club), the Toronto Rugby Football Club and the Hamilton Rugby Football Club, had meetings in Toronto and Montreal. The union continued to use the English rugby rules, and at the end of the season the winning club of the Quebec Championship played the Ontario Champion for the Club Championship of the Dominion.  This organization (also known as the Canadian Rugby Union) was the forerunner of the Canadian Football League, as rugby football in Canada evolved into Canadian football with rugby union being known as English rugby. To make matters more confusing the word rugby continued to be applied to Canadian football. It was not until 1967 that the original CRU finally cleared up this confusion by renaming itself the Canadian Amateur Football Association; it adopted its current name of Football Canada in 1986.  The Rugby Union of Canada, re-formed in 1965 and incorporated in 1974, is affiliated to World Rugby. It has competed in nine out of ten Rugby World Cups (the first in 1987 in Australia and New Zealand) and in the World Rugby Sevens Series.  National teams  National 7s teams  Canada has four Rugby Teams that are also part of International Gay Rugby;  Montreal Armada, Toronto Muddy York,  Ottawa Wolves, and the Vancouver Rogues. In 2022 the international Bingham Cup was held in Ottawa, Ontario. [1] "},{"title":"Substitute (association football)","content":"In association football, a substitute is a player who is brought on to the pitch during a match in exchange for an existing player. Substitutions are generally made to replace a player who has become tired or injured, or who is performing poorly, or for tactical reasons (such as bringing a striker on in place of a defender). A player who has been substituted during a match takes no further part in the game, in games played under the standard International Football Association Board Laws of the Game.  Substitutions were officially added to the Laws of the Game in 1958. Prior to this most games were played with no changes permitted at all, with occasional exceptions in cases of extreme injury or players not arriving to matches on time.  The number of substitutes has risen over time as well as the number of reserve players allowed to be nominated. It is now common for games to allow a maximum of 5 substitutions; some competitions allow for an additional substitution when playing extra time.[1] A maximum of 3 \"substitution opportunities\" are provided to a side during normal time, and an extra opportunity during extra time. Substitutions can be made during half-time breaks during normal and extra time, and full time breaks (before the start of extra time), but do not count as substitution opportunities.[2] There is also a provision of an additional substitution beyond whatever limits the match is being played under to be used specifically for a player who has sustained a concussion.[3]  Teams choose a substitute player from a pre-selected set of reserve players, these players typically sit in the technical area with the coaches, and are said to be \"on the bench\". When the substitute enters the field of play it is said they have come on or have been brought on, while the player they are substituting for is coming off, or being brought off or substituted. This pool of reserve players has also steadily increased in most competitions where they now allow 5, 7 or 9 reserves while in international competitive tournaments it is common that every player selected in the tournament squad (usually 23 players total) is an eligible substitute if they aren't suspended from the game.  A player who is noted for frequently making appearances, or scoring important goals, as a substitute is often informally known as a \"super sub\".  The origin of football substitutes goes back to at least the early 1860s as part of English public school football games. The original use of the term substitute in football was to describe the replacement of players who failed to turn up for matches. For example, in 1863, a match reports states: \"The Charterhouse eleven played a match in cloisters against some old Carthusians but in consequence of the non-appearance of some of those who were expected it was necessary to provide three substitutes.[4]\" The substitution of absent players happened as early as the 1850s, for example from Eton College where the term emergencies is used.[5] Numerous references to players acting as a \"substitute\" occur in matches in the mid-1860s[6] where it is not indicated whether these were replacements of absent players or of players injured during the match.  While substitution during games was first added to the Laws of the Game in 1958,[7] there are recorded instances of substitution being permitted on earlier occasions.  A friendly in Glasgow between Lancelot and Crosshill in November 1875 saw a Lancelot player injured and Crosshill \"allow[ed] them to put a fresh man in his place\".[8]  The earliest known use of a substitute in a competitive match came on 7 November 1885, when the Lockwood Brothers club used a substitute in an FA Cup first round replay against Notts Rangers, after midfielder F. Brears suffered a broken leg.[9]  The first use of a substitute in international football was on 15 April 1889, in the match between Wales and Scotland at Wrexham. Wales's original goalkeeper, Jim Trainer, failed to arrive; local amateur player Alf Pugh started the match and played for some 20 minutes until the arrival of Sam Gillam, who took over from him.[10] In 1940, in a match between Mandatory Palestine and Lebanon, Mandatory Palestine centre-half Zvi Fuchs was replaced at half-time by Lonia Dvorin following an injury.[11][12] Also during the qualifying phase for the 1954 World Cup, Horst Eckel of Germany is recorded as having been replaced by Richard Gottinger in their match with the Saarland on 11 October 1953.[13] The use of substitutes in World Cup Finals matches was not allowed until the 1970 tournament.[14]  The number of substitutes usable in a competitive match has increased from zero, meaning that teams were reduced if players' injuries could not allow them to play on, to one in 1958; to two out of a possible five in 1988. With the later increases in substitutions allowed, the number of potential substitute players increased to seven.[15] The number of substitutes increased to two plus one (injured goalkeeper) in 1994,[16] to three in 1995,[17][18] and to a fourth substitute in certain competitions (starting from UEFA Euro 2016) in extra time.[19] In 2020, following a proposal from FIFA, the International Football Association Board allowed for competition organisers to temporarily allow for a maximum of five substitutions (with an additional allowed in extra time, where applicable) to be made in official matches for the remainder of the year in order to lessen the impact of fixture congestion caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there will only be three opportunities to make substitutions (with an additional allowed in extra time, where applicable), excluding those made at half-time, before the start of extra time and at half-time in extra time.[20]  Substitutions are governed under Law 3 of the Laws of the Game in the (3) Substitution Procedure section.[21]  A player can only be substituted during a stoppage in play and with the permission of the referee. The player to be substituted (outgoing player) must have left the field of play before the substitute (incoming player) may enter the field of play; at that point the substitute becomes an active player and the person substituted ceases to be an active player. The incoming player may only enter the field at the halfway line. Failure to comply with these provisions may be punished by a caution (yellow card).  A player who has been substituted takes no further part in a match.  Unused substitutes still on the bench, as well as players who have been already substituted, remain under the authority of the referee. These are liable for misconduct, though cannot be said to have committed a foul. For example, in the 2002 FIFA World Cup, Claudio Caniggia was shown the red card for cursing at the referee from the bench.  Under the Laws of the Game, the referee has no specific power to force a player to be substituted, even if the team manager or captain has ordered their player to be substituted. As Law 3 (3) Substitution Procedure simply states that: \"if a player who is to be replaced refuses to leave, play continues.\" However, in some situations players may still be liable to punishment with a caution (yellow card) if they are perceived to be wasting time or behaving in an unsporting manner by refusing to leave the field of play.  A player who has been sent off (red card) cannot be replaced; the team will have to continue with one fewer player. In the case of a goalkeeper who is sent off, the coach will usually (but is not required to) substitute an outfield player so that the backup goalkeeper can enter the game. For example, in the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final, Arsenal midfielder Robert Pires was replaced by second-choice goalkeeper Manuel Almunia to replace Jens Lehmann, who was sent off less than 20 minutes into the match. If all substitutions have been used, or if no goalkeeper is available, an outfield player must take up the role of the goalkeeper. A famous example of this is when Chelsea goalkeepers Petr \u010cech and Carlo Cudicini were both injured in the same game, which led to defender John Terry spending the remainder of the match in goal wearing third-choice goalkeeper Hil\u00e1rio's shirt.[22]  According to the Laws of the Game, \"the number of substitutes, up to a maximum of five, which may be used in any match played in an official competition will be determined by FIFA, the confederation or the national football association.\" Also:  In October 2019, the International Football Association Board (IFAB) began discussing the use of additional substitutions for players who are suspected to have sustained a concussion during a match.[23] Earlier in the year, the chairman of FIFA's medical committee, Michel D'Hooghe, said the body was open to discussing concussion substitutions.[24] UEFA had also called for FIFA and IFAB to allow for temporary substitutes for suspected head injuries.[25][26] The idea had been previously discussed by the FIFA Executive Committee five years earlier. However, the prevailing view was that the rule would hurt football's \"universality\", as it would be difficult to replicate on a grassroots level, and could be exploited to waste time and\/or gain an additional substitution.[27]  In 2014, UEFA introduced a rule to allow referees to stop matches for up to three minutes to assess head injuries, with players only allowed to return after the team doctor could confirm the player's fitness to carry on.[28] The three-minute rule was similarly adopted at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[29] The change came following high-profile head injuries at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and calls by FIFPro for FIFA to review its concussion protocol.[30][31]  Initially, IFAB had considered a ten-minute assessment period for players suspected of a concussion, with a substitute replacing them in the interim.[27] In December 2019, IFAB agreed to appoint an expert group, composed of sports medical specialists and football experts, to identify options for the assessment and management of suspected concussions during matches.[32] Following feedback from the Concussion Expert Group, IFAB announced in February 2020 that it would draw up concussion substitute protocols to be used in trials.[33] In October 2020, the expert group announced that an \"additional permanent substitution\" protocol would be used to protect the health of players using an \"if in doubt, take them out\" philosophy, and that trials would start in 2021.[34][35] The protocol and trial was formally approved by IFAB on 16 December 2020. Under the protocol, players suspected of a concussion will be permanently removed from the match and replaced by a substitute. This prevents a player from sustaining multiple head injuries in a match, prevents teams from suffering a numerical or tactical disadvantage, reduces the pressure on medical personnel to make a quick assessment and can be applied on all levels of the game.[36] Competition organisers must be approved by FIFA and IFAB to participate in the trial period, which will last from January 2021 to March 2022.[37]  In January 2021, FIFA announced that it would trial concussion substitutes in the following month at the 2020 FIFA Club World Cup.[38] Later that month, it was announced that the Premier League, FA Women's Super League, FA Women's Championship and FA Cup would begin the trial in February 2021.[39][40] On 9 February 2021, West Ham United made the first concussion substitution in English football during an FA Cup match against Manchester United, when Issa Diop was replaced by Ryan Fredericks at half-time following a head injury.[41] The trial is also taking place in the Eredivisie, Eerste Divisie and KNVB Cup.[42]  IFAB announced two protocols for concussion substitutes, with competition organisers able to choose which to use. The use of concussion substitutes will operate in conjunction with other protocols used, including the three-minute break for an on-field concussion assessment.[43]  Both protocols use the following general principles and procedures:[43]  The following principles are specific to each protocol:[43]  The term \"super-sub\" refers to a player who is not a regular in the starting line-up but who is noted for often coming on a substitute and making a significant impact on the game. Players regarded as \"super-subs\" include David Fairclough and Divock Origi for Liverpool,[44][45] John Hewitt for Aberdeen,[45][46][47] Tosaint Ricketts for Vancouver Whitecaps FC, Adam Le Fondre for Reading,[48] Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, Scott McTominay[49] and Javier Hern\u00e1ndez for Manchester United,[50][51][45] Mikael Forssell for Chelsea,[52] Edin D\u017eeko for Manchester City,[53] Brendon Santalab for Western Sydney Wanderers,[54] Henrique for Brisbane Roar,[55] Stevie Kirk for Motherwell,[56] Archie Thompson, Joshua Kennedy and Tim Cahill for Australia,[57][58][59][60][61][62] Fernando Llorente for Tottenham Hotspur,[63][64] Roger Milla for Cameroon,[45] Oliver Bierhoff for Germany,[45] Ilsinho for Philadelphia Union,[65] and Abby Wambach and Carli Lloyd for the United States women's team.[66][67] "}]
